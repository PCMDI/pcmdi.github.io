# A Guide to CMIP6 Participation
##### Karl E. Taylor, Sebastien Denvil, Paul J. Durack, Michael Lautenschlager, Martina Stockhause, Dean Williams and many others

This guide is a “living” document, which will be augmented and updated as needed. It is sub-divided into three parts distinguished by the groups served:

* [Modelers][modelers] carrying out CMIP6 simulations, [Data managers][dataManagers]
 responsible for data node operations, and [Data users][dataUsers] analyzing and making use of CMIP6 model output.

Here are links to the parts of the guide.

1. Experiment design
1. Forcing data sets
1. Model output fields
