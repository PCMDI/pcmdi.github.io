# A Guide to CMIP6 Participation
##### Karl E. Taylor, Sebastien Denvil, Paul J. Durack, Michael Lautenschlager, Martina Stockhause, Dean Williams and many others

This guide is a “living” document, which will be augmented and updated as needed. It is sub-divided into three parts distinguished by the groups served:

* [Modelers][modelers] carrying out CMIP6 simulations, [Data managers][dataManagers]
 responsible for data node operations, and [Data users][dataUsers] analyzing and making use of CMIP6 model output.

Here are links to the parts of the guide.

1. Requirements and expectations
1. Experiment design
1. Forcing data sets
1. Model output fields
1. Model output requirements
1. Software for preparing/checking output
1. Archiving/publishing output

1. CMIP6 organization and governance


### [For CMIP6 ESGF data node managers and operators][dataManagers] (in preparation):

1. Hardware requirements
1. Operational requirements/expectations
