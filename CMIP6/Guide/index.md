#A Guide to CMIP6 Participation
###Karl E. Taylor, Sebastien Denvil, Paul J. Durack, Michael Lautenschlager, Martina Stockhause, Dean Williams and many others

This guide is a “living” document, which will be augmented and updated as needed. It is sub-divided into three parts distinguished by the groups served: 
 
1. Modelers carrying out CMIP6 simulations, 
2. Data managers responsible for data node operations, and 
3. Data users analyzing and making use of CMIP6 model output.  
 
Here are links to the parts of the guide.
 
##For CMIP6 participating climate modelers:
 
1. Requirements/expectations
2. Experiment design
3. Forcing data sets
4. Model output fields
5. Model output requirements
6. Software for preparing/checking output
7. Archiving/publishing output
8. Documentation process 
9. CMIP6 organization and governance
 
##For CMIP6 ESGF data node managers and operators (in preparation):
 
1. Hardware requirements
2. Operational requirements/expectations
3. Publication procedure
4. Software supporting publication/replication
 
##For Users of CMIP6 model output(in preparation):
 
1. Experiment design
2. Model output specifications
3. Accessing model output
4. Terms of use and citation requirements
5. Reporting suspected errors
6. Registering published work based on CMIP6
