The [WCRP][WCRP] Working Group on Coupled Modelling ([WGCM][WGCM]) oversees the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which is now in its 6th phase. Background
information about CMIP and its phases can be found on [PCMDI-hosted pages][MIPs]
as well as on the [WGCM website][WGCM]. Practical information for those interested
in participating in CMIP6 is provided in three guides, tailored to different groups:
 
* [Modelers][modelers] carrying out CMIP6 simulations, 
* [Data managers][dataManagers] responsible for data node operations, and 
* [Data users][dataUsers] analyzing and making use of CMIP6 model output
