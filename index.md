PCMDI was established in 1989 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([LLNL]),
located in the [San Francisco Bay Area][SF], in California. PCMDI pParticipants
include research scientists and computer scientists at LLNL, other research laboratories,
and universities. PCMDI is funded by the Regional and Global Model Analysis
([RGMA][RGMA]) Program Area of the United States Department of Energy's (DOE) Earth
and Environmental Systems Modeling ([EESM][EESM]) Program. The EESM is a component
of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division ([EESSD][EESSD]) which
is within the Biological and Environmental Research ([BER][BER]) Program Office
of the DOE's [Office of Science][OoS].

The PCMDI mission is to develop advanced methods and tools for the diagnosis,
intercomparison and improvement of Global Climate (GCMs) and Earth System Models
(ESMs). The need for innovative analysis of ESM simulations is apparent, as increasingly
more complex models are developed. At the same time, disagreements among these
simulations relative to observations and in their predictions of climate change
remain significant and incompletely understood. Through PCMDI's efforts, ESMs will
advance so that they are capable of addressing the important questions that policy
makers and society have about ongoing global climate change.

PCMDI's mission demands that we work on both scientific projects and infrastructural
tasks. Our current scientific projects focus on developing
[performance metrics for ESMs][metrics], identifying robust [Cloud Feedbacks][cf]
in observations and models, devising robust statistical methods for climate-change
[detection/attribution][DandA], and understanding ESM errors through a
[model parameterization testbed][mpt]. Examples of ongoing infrastructural tasks
include the development of [software and data standards][software] for model intercomparison
project (MIP) data management, data creation and computation; the assembly/organization
of observational data sets for model validation [obs4MIPs][obs4mips]; the assembly
and curation of forcing data sets for ESMs [input4MIPs][input4mips]; and the consistent
documentation of [climate model features][cmf] across the numerous eras of the
Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) and Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP) phases. Details of PCMDI's work are described in our
[publications][publications] and [research highlights][researchhighlights].

We are also applying our collective expertise to support modeling studies initiated
by the World Climate Research Programme ([WCRP]). Notably, we lead aspects of
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 6 ([CMIP6][CMIP6]). Among PCMDI's
CMIP6 role is the responsibility for leading the WCRP Working Group on Coupled
Modelling [WGCM][WGCM] which coordinates infrastructure support for CMIP, including
interactions with the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF]) project which stores
and distributes petabyte-scale data sets from multiple MIP phases. Extensive analysis
of the latest CMIP6 simulations by the international climate community anchored
much of the scientific basis for the
[IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report on Climate Change][ar6], published in August 2021.
