PCMDI was established in 1989 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([LLNL]), located in the [San Francisco Bay area, 
in California][sf]. Participants in PCMDI include research scientists and computer scientists at LLNL, other research laboratories and universities. PCMDI is 
funded by the Regional and Global Model Analysis ([RGMA](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/program-area/regional-global-model-analysis)) Program Area of the United States's Department of Energy's Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling ([EESM](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov)) Program.  The EESM is a component of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division ([EESSD](https://science.osti.gov/ber/Research/eessd)) which is within the Biological and Environmental Research ([BER](https://www.energy.gov/science/ber/biological-and-environmental-research)) Program Office of the United States's Department of Energy's [Office of Science](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science).  

The PCMDI mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and intercomparison of general circulation models 
(GCMs) that simulate the global climate. The need for innovative analysis of GCM climate simulations is apparent, as increasingly
more complex models are developed, while the disagreements among these simulations and relative to climate observations remain 
significant and poorly understood. The nature and causes of these disagreements must be accounted for in a systematic fashion in
order to confidently use GCMs for simulation of putative global climate change.    

PCMDI's mission demands that we work on both scientific projects and infrastructural tasks. Our current scientific projects 
focus on supporting [model intercomparison][mi], on developing a [model parameterization testbed][mpt], identification of robust [Cloud 
Feedbacks][cf] in observations and models and on devising robust statistical methods for climate-change [detection/attribution][DandA]. 
Examples of ongoing infrastructural tasks include the development of [software][aims] for data management, visualization, and computation; 
the assembly/organization of observational data sets for model validation; and the consistent documentation of [climate model 
features][cmf]. Details of all this work are described in numerous publications, as well as on this website.    

We now also are applying our collective expertise to support modeling studies initiated by the World Climate Research Programme 
([WCRP]). Notably, we are currently providing leadership in managing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 ([CMIP5]). 
Among PCMDI's role in CMIP5 is responsibility for leading the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF]) which stores and distributes 
terrascale data sets from multiple coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate model simulations. Extensive analysis of these 
simulations by members of the international climate community will provide an important scientific basis for the [IPCC's Fifth 
Assessment Report on Climate Change][report], which is scheduled for publication in 2013.
