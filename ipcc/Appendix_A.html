<p><b><font size="4">Appendix A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposal for Radiative 
Forcing Calculations (attached to a letter from the IPCC co-chairs)</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>1. Online Approximation to Forcing:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is to approximate radiative forcing for the 
major radiatively active species using online calculations during model 
integrations.&nbsp; The models should be configured to save monthly mean net 
shortwave&nbsp; and longwave fluxes at the surface, top of atmosphere (TOA), and 
200mb. The net fluxes at 200mb will be used as surrogates for the net fluxes at 
the tropopause.&nbsp; The archived fluxes should correspond to the radiative heating 
rates interacting with the remainder of the model physics. </p>
<p>At 10-year intervals during the integration, for a period 
of one year, a second set of diagnostic radiative calculations should be 
performed using the same state information as the interactive radiative 
calculations.&nbsp; The differences between the diagnostic and interactive radiative 
fluxes will provide estimates of the radiative forcing.&nbsp; The diagnostic 
calculations should include (1) a calculation with all radiatively active trace 
gases and sulfate set to the same values as the 19th century control 
integrations; and (2) separate calculations for each species at current 
concentrations with the other species held at 19th century values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>2. Reference Calculations:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A separate computation is necessary to quantify the 
differences between these approximate forcing estimates and the standard 
definition of forcing with the tropospheric state held fixed and the 
stratosphere adjusted using fixed dynamical heating.&nbsp; An additional set of 
diagnostic calculations should be performed at the same decadal interval for 
one-year periods. In this second set, the tropospheric state parameters should 
be set to values from a monthly mean climatology derived from the 19th century 
control integration.&nbsp; The stratosphere&nbsp; should be adjusted via the fixed 
dynamical heating derived from the control integration.&nbsp; Net fluxes should be 
archived at the surface, TOA, 200mb, and model tropopause for all species reset 
to control values and for each individual species set to current values.&nbsp; In 
addition, the net fluxes at the model tropopause should be computed using 
current model state information and concentrations of radiatively active 
species.&nbsp; These calculations can be performed either during the model 
integration or using offline RT codes with complete state information archived 
from the model.</p>
