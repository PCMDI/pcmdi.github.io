Dear IPCC analyst,

Although the IPCC publication deadline has passed, we plan to continue support of 
the multi-model dataset at PCMDI which most of you have accessed.  
We expect the current database to be the basis for continued scientific investigation.

We are writing to ask you for input to help us prioritize the things we plan to do,
and, more importantly, to assist us in preparing an improved data service for 
the next round of simulations (likely to become available a few years from now).  
There is an expectation that different parts of the future multi-model database 
will be archived at multiple modeling centers and a few data centers around the
world, and the data will be accessible through a common portal.  The user will 
be able to search and retrieve the data as if it were all at a single location.

As we plan for this, we would like your input concerning some specific items 
below and, more generally, your thoughts concerning what your needs will be.  

========================================================================================
Please return the completed survey to williams13@llnl.gov.
Your input is needed by September 11th to be most useful.
========================================================================================

First, please rate the following items, according to the priority you think they deserve, 
with a number (1, 2, or 3) indicating high (1) to low (3) priority.

a) Improved search capability.

b) Improved publication of errata.

c) Improved notice of new data availability.

We are also aware that the registration procedure was confusing for some of you, 
and we will work to simplify it.  If you have suggestions as to what features 
should be included in any of the above, please provide them here:



To what extent did you use the data portal (https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/index.jsp), 
and to what extent did you obtain data via ftp?



Which of the following capabilities would you have found most useful in obtaining 
the data you needed?  Please provide as much detail as you can.

a) Would extracting a subset of the data in a file be really useful?
   (e.g., only a certain region, only a few time-slices, only a single layer)



b) What about aggregating data into a single file? 
   (e.g., forming a single file from data stored in several files; note netCDF 
    files are currently limited to 2.2 gigabytes).



c) What temporal "granularity" would you like to see in the files you retrieve?
   Should each file contain only 1 year?, 10 years?, 50 years? of data?



d) Would you have preferred to obtain data that had already been processed 
   on the server side?  (e.g., climatology computed for some 
   standard period or a zonal mean).  If so, specify what type of calculations.



e) What dissimilarities in the way the output from different models was stored 
   caused you the most headaches and how important would it be to
   impose more uniformity?


In the space below, we hope you will share with us any negative or positive
experiences you had dealing with the database at PCMDI.  In particular, 
what is the single thing you would most like to see fixed or improved?



Finally, do you have any other comments as to what a future data portal should look like?



========================================================================================


Thank you very much for your input.  Your suggestions will help improve our service to you.

Sincerely yours,
Karl Taylor and Dean Williams
PCMDI
