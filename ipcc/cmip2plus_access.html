<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
Enhanced CMIP2 (or "CMIP2+") data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
includes a fairly complete set
of atmospheric and oceanic output variables from twelve coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs (including
interactive sea ice).
A list of the models and the numerical experiments that produced the data is
provided in an ASCII text file on the Web at
<p>
<a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/cmip/cmip2plus_models.txt">
           cmip2plus_models.txt</a>
<p>
The output is stored as monthly and daily means.


Before exploring this database, it is advisable to check
a similar but
more condensed (CMIP2) set of the data
from a somewhat different set of models.  
In addition to its smaller volume, 
the CMIP2 data is more uniformly formatted than the CMIP2+ data,
and is thus easier to work with.
CMIP2 data
includes monthly mean precipitation, sea level
pressure and surface air temperature (but not
SST). CMIP2 output can be downloaded by
anonymous FTP:
<P>
<A HREF = "ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/cmip2">ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/cmip2</A>
<P>
Consult the readme_CMIP2 file for details.
Note that one of the models (YONU)
employs non-standard forcing in which sea ice is
held constant throughout the increasing-CO2 run.
Additional information about CMIP2 models
is on the Web at
<A HREF = "/cmip/Table.htm">Table.htm.</A>

<P>
<H2>CMIP2+ model output is stored at NERSC</H2>
<P>
CMIP2+ model output is stored at the National Energy Reserach Supercompter Center (NERSC).
You will need a NERSC account to download the data.
To request an account for this purpose, use the form on the Web at
<A HREF = "/cmip/cmipform.html">
    cmipform.html.</A>
<P>
CMIP2+ output is stored at archive.nersc.gov, part of NERSC's High Performance Storage
System (HPSS).
The default method for data transfer to or from HPSS is now FTP with
remote automatic authentication.  Detailed instructions for this method
are on the Web at 
<A HREF = "http://hpcf.nersc.gov/storage/hpss/ftp_nopass.html">
           http://hpcf.nersc.gov/storage/hpss/ftp_nopass.html.</A>
NERSC will not allow FTP to or from HPSS with clear text passwords.
Remote automatic authentication is also required for an alternative
method of communication with HPSS, the High Speed Interface (HSI).  HSI
is basically a more sophisticated version of FTP that is better behaved
in transfering large data sets.  To use this method, you will need to
download the HSI code to your local machine (see
<A HREF = "http://hpcf.nersc.gov/storage/hpss/#hsiaccess">
           http://hpcf.nersc.gov/storage/hpss/#hsiaccess).</A>
<p>
Remote automatic authentication can have troublesome interaction with
firewalls.  If you experience difficulties, your first course of action
should be to e-mail a full transcript of your session, together with the
time you attempted to log on and the name of the local computer you were
using, to consult@nersc.gov.  (You can also reach NERSC consultants by
phoning 1-800-66NERSC during weekdays, California time.)  If you have
problems that are not resolved quickly, please let us know.
<P>
<H2>Atmosphere output</H2>
<p>
Monthly mean atmosphere
output is available under directory /nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/mo.  
The output is sorted by variable name:
subdirectories are names of variables and each subdirectory
contains output from all models providing the given variable.
Thus a listing of all available variables can be obtained,
using HSI to connect with archive.nersc.gov, 
by "cd"-ing to /nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/mo and 
listing its subdirectories by issuing the command "ls".
<P>
Output from both control runs and 1% per year increasing
CO2 scenarios (or "perturbed" runs) is included.  
Not all models appear under 
each field, because they store data in different ways --
e.g., some save upward solar flux at the top of the 
atmosphere while others store net downward -- and because
output fields from different models are different.
Even output fields from different runs of the same model
are not necessarily identical.
For example, the HadCM2 control run, but
not the HadCM2 perturbed run, includes specific humidity in
its output.
<P>
Variable
name conventions are taken from AMIP2, as given on the
Web at
<P>
<A HREF = "{{site.baseurl}}/mips/amip/OUTPUT/AMIP2/outlist.html">
outlist.html</A>
<P>
and from CMIP2, as listed in the readme_CMIP2 file mentioned above 
<A HREF = "ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/cmip2/readme_CMIP2">
(ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/cmip2/readme_CMIP2).</A>
An additional
naming convention involves net fluxes
at the surface and the top of the atmosphere:
"rlns", "rsns", "rsnscs" and "rsnt" are
net (difference between upward and downward) fluxes 
analogous to AMIP standard variables "rlus", "rlds", 
"rsus", etc.
In some cases variables do not fall under either AMIP or
CMIP naming conventions.  These variables have the names
assigned to them by the original modeling groups.
For example, "cl_hi", "cl_lo" and "cl_med" are
high, low and medium-height cloud fractions from 
the NCAR CCM3, and "cloud" is 3D cloud amount from GFDL.
<P>
CMIP2+ monthly mean time series begin with the month of January,
<EM>with the exception of the Hadley Center Models</EM>:
HadCM2 output starts in September and HadCM3 output starts
in December.
In addition, as noted in the ASCII text file
<a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/cmip/cmip2plus_models.txt">
           cmip2plus_models.txt,</a>
the HadCM3 perturbed run (but not the control
run) is missing one month of output: the 237th month in the series is
August but the 238th month is October rather than September.
Time coordinates for the various models can be confusing, so
for monthly mean data it's
generally a good idea to access time points by index rather
than the value of the time coordinate.
<p>
Coordinates of the standard atmosphere output are the ones provided
by the contributing modelers. In some cases the vertical coordinate is
pressure; in others it is "sigma" or a hybrid sigma-pressure coordinate.
In CSIRO model output the vertical coordinate is incorrectly named
"zt_k" due to a mistake made in formatting the data for CMIP.
Vertical coordinate values for this model are actually pressure (in hPa)
divided by 1000;
the pressure coordinate values, however, are not round numbers.
Specific humidity (hus) from the Hadley Center models was provided on model 
sigma levels, whereas relative humidity (hur) and other atmospheric fields
were provided on standard pressure levels.
Of course hur can be converted to hus on the
given pressure levels using atmospheric temperature.
<p>
In additon to providing model output in original vertical coordinates, the PCMDI
has done interpolation to 18 WMO standard pressure levels (compatible
with NCEP and ECMWF reanalysis products) for selected monthly mean fields from CSIRO and 
from the models
that did not supply output on pressure levels, namely CSM1, GFDL and PCM.
Results are available in directory /nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/mo/PInterpolated.
They include hus, ua, va, ta and zg (except that zg was not provided by CSIRO).
<p>
Daily mean atmosphere output from a subset of the
CMIP2+ models is also available at NERSC, under directory
/nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/da.
Subdirectories under this main directory store the data by
variable name, as with monthly mean output.
Some files are divided by time segment to keep the file size
within reasonable limits.
In these cases the file name indicates the time segment as
well as the variable and the model.
For example, ua_pcm_con_d_4000_4999.nc
contains zonal wind ("ua") from the PCM control run for days 4000-4999.
The numbering scheme for days starts with 0 on the first day
of the output.
The time coordinate is usually in the form "days since [year]-[month]-[day]."
Note that the CCSM, CSM, CSIRO, GFDL, MRI and PCM models employ a calendar of 365 days per
year with no leap years, and that ECHAM4/OPYC3, ECHO-G and the Hadley Center models
employ a calendar of 360 days per year (each month has 30 days).
Let Curt know if you need help figuring out the calendar dates
of daily output.
<p>
Daily frequency output from three late-arriving CMIP2+ models,
ECHAM4/OPYC3, ECHO-G and MRI, is stored as it was received (without any 
formatting or other processing at the PCMDI) under NERSC directories
/nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/[model_name].
The file names make it fairly obvious which time periods are
covered by this output.
For example, ECHAM4/OPYC3 output file names end in a year/month (yyyymm) designation.
(ECHAM4/OPYC3 output is missing for yyymm = 27310-27312 and 27410-27503.)
<p>
Please note that GFDL's daily mean 
output from the increasing-CO2
scenario is taken from a different
run (of the same model) than the analogous monthly mean output.
The monthly mean increasing-CO2 output is from the run designated by
GFDL as R30_1PCT_B.
The daily mean increasing-CO2 output is from the run designated by
GFDL as R30_1PCT_C.
The "C" run is just a different ensemble member with the same forcing
but different initial conditions.
<p>
For GFDL daily mean control run output,
the data in /nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/da includes 
GFDL-defined Years 261-425
(which correspond to Days 0-60224 in the
file nomenclature discussed above).
Daily output from Years 131-425 was supplied to CMIP2+
from GFDL, but gaps were present in the data before Year 261.
We decided not to process this data; it is available on request in its
orginal format.

<p>
<h2>Ocean output</h2>
<p>
Monthly mean ocean and sea ice output is available 
at NERSC under directory 
/nersc/k/krishna/CMIP2Plus/mo.
Organization of this data is similar to the atmosphere data; for details
see the
<a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/cmip/OceanData">OceanData Web page</a>.
As noted in that documentation, ocean output has not been processed yet
for two models that employ non-retilinear coordinate systems (the
PCM and the Community Climate System Model).
We hope to process this data in the near future. 

<P>
<H2>Final notes</H2>
<p>
Both control run output and perturbed case output is available from
the first version of the Community Climate System Model (CSM1).
Control run output is now available from the second version of this model
(CCSM2).
The second version's output should be used instead of the first version's
output where feasible.
The second version's output is available in a special NERSC directory,
/nersc/mp193/mwehner/ccsm2.0/b20.007.
Alternatively, this output may be obtained directly from the NCAR mass
storage system.
<P>
Both CMIP2 and CMIP2+ data are stored in NetCDF, a commonly used
format in atmospheric research.
Users of GrADS should be able to read this data if they are using
a recent version of GrADS.
Older versions
of GrADS can't handle time units expressed as months
since a base time, as is the case for several CMIP2+ output
sets.
<P>
For CMIP2+, we have attempted to archive all the
atmosphere data we received except for some truly obscure fields that 
even the modelers thought would not interest anyone.
We have also processed and archived most but not all of the ocean and sea
ice data.
If there are fields your subproject needs that are not 
in the database, please let us know and we'll look 
around for them.
<P>
Some CMIP2+ ocean and sea ice data was provided to us as part of
the "atmosphere" component of model output and is stored at NERSC
accordingly, in directory /nersc/afu/u5024/CMIP2Plus/mo. 
In most cases this data simply duplicates a subset of the ocean data
in the atmosphere's coordinates.
For example,
SST was included (with ground surface temperature) in the
atmosphere output of most models as variable "ts", and GFDL's sea ice thickness
was for some reason included in that model's atmosphere output.
