<p>Please place the following acknowledgement in all analyses based on the IPCC 
model output:</p>
<p>&quot;<i>We acknowledge the modeling groups for providing their data for 
analysis, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) 
for collecting and archiving the model output, and the JSC/CLIVAR Working Group 
on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for organizing the model data analysis activity.&nbsp;

In some cases data contributed to the database have been found to contain errors 
of various sorts. Certain files are then withdrawn or replaced and an entry is 
logged on the errata page:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/errata.do">
https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/errata.do</a> <br>
&nbsp;The errata page should be checked frequently to avoid analyzing &quot;garbage&quot;, 
and to determine whether any of the files you have downloaded from the PCMDI 
site need to be updated or removed. If any of you find undetected errors in the 
data you are analyzing, please contact the responsible modeling group and copy
<a href="mailto:taylor13@llnl.gov">taylor13@llnl.gov</a>. </p>
<p>
One general warning concerning the global attributes in each file -- the &quot;title&quot; 
and &quot;comment&quot; attributes may in some cases incorrectly identify the experiment, 
whereas the &quot;experiment_id&quot; will always be correct.&nbsp; If there is a 
conflict, rely only on experiment_id.</p>

&quot;performance metrics&quot;</a></font></b><br>
<br>
Some of the IPCC WG1 lead authors (notably from Chapter 8  model evaluation) 
have requested specific information that might prove useful in preparing their 
chapters. The overall purpose of Chapter 8 of the AR4 is to assess the ability 
of the global climate models to make projections of future climate change. Many 
of the analyses you are performing will contribute to answering this question. 
In the Third Assessment Report, Table 8.2 included several ocean circulation 
diagnostics for each of the models, along with an observational estimate of 
these same quantities (e.g., Antarctic circumpolar current transport strength, 
Nino 3 SST standard deviation, etc.). For the AR4, plans include considerably 
expanding a table of this sort, providing characteristics of the mean climate 
state and additional metrics for quantifying the ability of models to simulate 
particular phenomena. The chapter 8 authors would like to rely on you to provide 
scalar measures of model performance for each model and, when practical, for the 
multi-model mean simulation. These measures might, as appropriate, be in the 
form of an RMS error, a correlation, a mean difference, a ratio of variances, or 
(as in the TAR Table 8.2) simply a scalar measure of some simulated and observed 
quantity. As one part of your analysis, therefore, it would be useful to 
synthesize your results into a single (or perhaps a couple of) scalar metrics 
that can be used to gauge how well each individual model simulates the aspect of 
climate that you are analyzing. This request should certainly not be considered 
a requirement, but if you can produce a scalar metric of this sort, the chapter 
8 authors will be grateful. <br>
<br>
A final note concerning metrics: For some quantities, observational uncertainty 
will be an issue. Whenever possible, therefore, an assessment should be made as 
to how this uncertainty might affect the apparent agreement or disagreement 
between models and observations. When more than one reliable observational data 
set is available, it would be helpful to calculate differences based also on the 
alternative. <br>
<br>

&quot;mean climate&quot;</a></font></b><br>
<br>
The IPCC WG1 lead authors have also made the following suggestion meant to help 
unify the analysis of model results. In defining the 'mean climate state' of a 
model for comparison against observations there are number of choices that could 
be made, e.g. use model 'control runs' (which may have either preindustrial or 
present day trace gases), or use the '20th Century all forcings' runs (many of 
which are available as ensembles started from varying initial conditions). For 
the 20th Century integrations there is also a choice of meaning period. It is 
recognized that the optimal choice for a given problem may depend on a number of 
factors including the period over which observations are available, and the need 
for a non-drifting or non-trending model solution. We also recognize that some 
projects have already begun their analyses based on a particular choice. We 
therefore do not wish to prescribe a solution to this problem and leave it to 
the judgment of individual projects. However, in cases where there is a choice, 
we wish to encourage as much uniformity in the analysis as possible, and 
therefore propose that other things being equal, model mean climate is defined 
based on the 1981-2000 period of the 'all forcings 20th Century' runs (or the 
ensemble mean where appropriate). </p>

<font size="3"><a name="IPCC_timeline">IPCC 
deadlines and transfer of information to WG1 Lead Authors</a></font></b><br>
<br>
To fit with the IPCC review process, papers will need to be submitted to 
peer-reviewed journals and available to IPCC lead authors by 1 MAY 2005
<a href="revised_deadlines.html">(REVISED TO 31 MAY 2005)</a>, and
accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal by approximately 1 DEC 2005
<a href="revised_deadlines.html">(REVISED TO 15 DECEMBER 2005)</a>.
These deadlines are set to allow lead authors time to consider all available 
literature in time for the first and second AR4 drafts. Electronic copies of 
papers need to be sent to the appropriate lead author contacts, with an 
electronic copy lodged with the WG1 Technical Support Unit (TSU)  see below.
<br>
<br>
For the May deadline, the authors need some form of draft paper to assess. In 
almost all cases this will be in the form of a paper submitted to a 
peer-reviewed journal. An exception to the need for a peer-reviewed paper can be 
made for calculations of well-established diagnostics (e.g. where the diagnostic 
and the lines of inference from the results are described in a number of 
existing peer-reviewed papers). This would be at the discretion of the lead 
authors and would be subject to scrutiny by the WG1 Review Editors and Bureau. 
If you are planning work of this type I would advise establishing early direct 
contact with an appropriate lead author. <br>
<br>
<i>List of contacts for AR4 modelling chapters</i> <br>
<br>
Please email a pdf copy of your paper to the IPCC WG1 TSU&nbsp; (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ipcc-wg1@al.noaa.gov">ipcc-wg1@al.noaa.gov</a>) 
and to the&nbsp; relevant contact points below. Note that your study may be relevant 
to more than one chapter (e.g. a study that considers both the control 
simulations of ENSO and future changes in ENSO would be relevant to both 
Chapters 8 and 10). <br>
<br>
Roughly speaking, Ch. 8 deals with simulations of aspects of the climatology or 
processes in present-day climate, Ch. 9 addresses simulation of trends or 
responses to specific forcings in 20th century climate in addition to 
detection/attribution studies, Ch. 10 assesses any aspect of climate change 
projections from global models, and Ch. 11 deals with aspects of regional 
climate change projections from regional models or information downscaled from 
global models.&nbsp; These are not strict boundaries, but are used for general 
guidance to give you a rough idea of where to send copies of your papers.&nbsp; As 
long as you send copies to the chapter contacts you think are relevant for your 
paper, it is then the responsibility of the respective lead authors to sort out 
exactly where your results will be assessed. <br>
