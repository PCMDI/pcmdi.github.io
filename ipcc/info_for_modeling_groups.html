The links immediately below lead to forms that should be filled out to provide 
some basic model documentation in uniform format.&nbsp; The information asked 
for on the attached document clearly does not constitute full model 
documentation, but it should answer many of the common questions that arise when 
analyzing output from multiple models.&nbsp; A number of scientists have helped in 
preparing this form, including IPCC chapter 8 lead authors, other lead authors, 
and PCMDI scientists. Please enter information for your model into one of these 
two forms electronically and return it to

From the metadata contained in the model output files, it is not always clear at 
what point in the control run, the perturbation run was initiated.&nbsp; Sometimes 
this data can be found in the global attributes, but even then we have found 
ambiguities.&nbsp; To avoid any misinterpretation, we have posted on our web site 
this information from groups who have already contributed model output to the 
archive (in 3 different formats: <a href="time_correspondence_summary.htm">web

<a href="time_correspondence_summary.pdf">pdf file</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
New contributors of data should enter the information from their model into the 
one of the following forms:</p>

Request for CO2 radiative forcing information (from Taylor, Boer, and Webb)&nbsp;</a></b></p>
<p>
30 December 2004 <br>
Dear colleagues, <br>
<br>
We represent two of the projects registered to analyze IPCC model output 
archived at PCMDI. Our interest is in understanding differences in model climate 
sensitivity and feedbacks in these simulations. It is important for the IPCC to 
move beyond simply reporting the range of global climate sensitivities as was 
the case in past Reports. This is the primary reason that radiative forcing 
fields were requested as part of the IPCC standard output (see
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html">
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html</a>). <br>
<br>
We are unable to proceed with these projects without first obtaining the model 
radiative forcing fields (on your global grid), and we are writing to ask for 
your assistance. We limit our request to the 2xCO2 case. The additional 
calculations required are very modest and result in monthly mean 2xCO2 radiative 
forcing, resolved into four components: <br>
<br>
1. longwave clear-sky radiative forcing. <br>
2. longwave all-sky radiative forcing <br>
3. shortwave clear-sky radiative forcing <br>
4. shortwave all-sky radiative forcing <br>
<br>
The analysis will be most straight-forward if you report the 2xCO2 forcing for 
the 4 components listed above at 200 mb (or the tropopause) and if you calculate 
these fluxes <br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; both before and after stratospheric adjustment (i.e., the instantaneous and 
adjusted forcing). <br>
or, if you are unable to do this, <br>
2.&nbsp; before stratospheric adjustment (i.e., the instantaneous forcing). <br>
<br>
Although &quot;adjusted&quot; forcing is preferred on theoretical grounds, some groups may 
not be able to perform this calculation, so option 2 is also acceptable.&nbsp; The 
groups who perform both the &quot;instantaneous&quot; and &quot;adjusted&quot; calculations will 
facilitate both understanding of the feedbacks and also comparisons with those 
models where option 2 is followed.&nbsp; Further technical details and guidance are 
provided in notes at the end of this email and one method of computing the 
adjusted radiative forcing for CO2 is described in Tett et al. 2002 (JGR VOL 
107, No. D16, 10.1029/2000JD000028).<br>
<br>
The deadline for analyzing IPCC model output is distressingly near since 
analyses must be submitted for publication by May. We ask for your assistance in 
providing this radiative forcing data as soon as possible. <br>
<br>

Notes on calculation of radiative forcing <br>
------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
As explained in the list of IPCC standard output document (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html</a>), 
the four components of the forcing fields should be provided as a function of 
longitude and latitude for each of the 12 months of the year. Traditionally, the 
calculation is based on a control climate basic state in which two radiation 
calculations are performed each time step, one with 1xCO2 (i.e., the control), 
and the second with CO2 doubled.&nbsp; The result of each of these calculations is 
separately accumulated and archived each month, while integrating the model 
through a single annual cycle.&nbsp; Only the set of fluxes calculated with 1xCO2 is 
actually &quot;seen&quot; by the model itself (i.e., these are the fluxes that contribute 
to diabatic heating).&nbsp; The difference between the two fluxes is the radiative 
forcing. <br>
<br>
To summarize: <br>
<br>
Let S and L be the shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes, respectively, at 200 
mb (or the tropopause). <br>
<br>
For the control simulation (1xCO2) retain: <br>
- all sky components So and Lo <br>
- corresponding clear sky components <br>
- monthly means at 200 mb (tropopause) on the grid for 1 year <br>
<br>
For the control simulation, do a second diagnostic call to the radiation code 
with 2xCO2 but with all other variables unchanged. Retain: <br>
- all sky components S*, L* <br>
- corresponding clear sky components <br>
- monthly means at 200 mb (tropopause) on the grid for 1 year <br>
<br>
The instantaneous 200mb (tropopause) forcing is given by the difference between 
the two calculations (S*-So, L*-Lo, and similarly for clear-sky components). <br>
<br>
The above description neglects treatment of stratospheric adjustment. Several 
different methods for calculating the stratospherically adjusted forcing have 
been used.&nbsp; Upon request, options for computing stratospheric adjustment will be 
discussed in a future correspondence. <br>
