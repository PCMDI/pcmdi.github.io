<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Data_Searching"></a>Data
Searching<br>
</span>To get a broad overview of IPCC data status, you first may want
to consult the <a href="data_status_tables.html">Data
Availability Summary</a> for a pictorial depiction of the currently
available data (time-independent fields as well as time-dependent data
at 3-hourly, daily-mean, or monthly-mean sampling frequencies) for
various control and climate-change runs from different IPCC
models.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Then consult the <a href="standard_output.html">Tables of
IPCC Standard Output</a> for details (e.g. the acronyms and long names)
on the climate variables that are <span style="font-style: italic;">potentially
available</span> from each
model simulation.&nbsp; Similar, but less precise, information is given on the <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/ipccTables.do">IPCC Model Output</a>
page.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Next, consult the <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/search.do">Search
Instructions</a>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You have the option of making either a <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/data/metadataSearchPage.do">basic
search</a> or an <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/data/advancedSearchPage.do">advanced
search</a>.&nbsp; The former is useful, for example, to determine all
the available model simulations of the of the 20th Century climate
scenario (supply the acronym <span style="font-weight: bold;">20c3m</span>
as the search string).&nbsp; The <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/data/metadataSearchPage.do">basic
search</a> also will list different members (<span style="font-weight: bold;">run1</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">run2</span>, etc.) of an ensemble
(simulations with the same forcings, but with different initial
conditions) of such climate scenarios&nbsp; for each model, if
relevant. (At first, you may only wish to analyze, say, <span style="font-weight: bold;">run1</span> of a model ensemble, but
considering more than one ensemble member allows the "robustness" of
one's analysis conclusions to be critically examined.)&nbsp; The <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/data/advancedSearchPage.do">advanced
search</a> is more relevant if you wish to locate all data sets for a
particular climate scenario (e.g. 20c3m) and frequency (e.g. monthly
means).&nbsp; A variant of the <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/data/advancedSearchPage.do">advanced
search</a> is to find all the files for a particular&nbsp; climate
variable (e.g. total precipitation flux <span style="font-weight: bold;">pr</span>) for a particular frequency
across specified model simulations or climate scenarios.<br>

<a name="Browsing_and_Downloading_Data"></a>Browsing and Downloading
Data Using the PCMDI Portal<br>
</span>Consult the <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/browse.do">Browsing
and Downloading Data</a> page for detailed instructions.&nbsp; Also
note that known problems with the IPCC model data are listed on a
frequently
updated <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/errata.do">Errata</a>
page.<br>
<br>
Anyone can browse (i.e. search, as described above) the IPCC archive,
but to actually download data you must <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/security/loginPage.do?redirect=https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/home/publicHomePage.do">login</a>
with the password you designated when <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/security/accountRequestData.do">registering</a>.&nbsp;
Then, when the results of your data search are displayed, you can
specify which climate variable time series to actually download by
checking the appropriate checkbox(es) and submitting a download
request.&nbsp;&nbsp; After your file requests have been staged by the
data portal for download (usually within the same day of your request),
you will be notified by e-mail.&nbsp; Clicking the links in this
message then will effect the necessary data transfer (via ftp) to your
local computer platform.&nbsp; You then can organize these files
according to your own local directory preferences.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<a name="Downloading_Data_Via_FTP"></a>Downloading Data Via FTP<br>
</span>Once you are more familiar with the climate
scenarios/frequencies/variables/models that are of&nbsp; most interest,
you have the option of directly ftp'ing the desired data, rather than
operating through the data portal interface.&nbsp; This has the
advantage of allowing many simultaneous data requests to be effected
via a single ftp 'mget' command.&nbsp; If you want to try this option,
see the page on <a href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/ftp.do">Downloading
Data Via FTP</a> for details.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
