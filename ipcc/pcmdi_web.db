Bader','Secular trends and climate drift in coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models','Coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (coupled GCMs) with interactive sea ice are the primary tool for investigating possible future global warming and numerous other issues in climate science.  A long-standing problem with such models is that when different components of the physical climate system are linked together, the simulated climate can drift away from observation unless constrained by ad hoc adjustments to interface fluxes.  However, 11 modern coupled GCMs — including three that do not employ flux adjustments — behave much better in this respect than the older generation of models.  Surface temperature trends in control run simulations (with external climate forcing such as solar brightness and atmospheric carbon dioxide held constant) are small compared with observed trends, which include 20th century climate change due to both anthropogenic and natural factors.  Sea ice changes in the models are dominated by interannual variations.  Deep ocean temperature and salinity trends are small enough for model control runs to extend over 1000 simulated years or more, but trends in some regions, most notably the Arctic, differ substantially among the models and may be problematic.  Methods used to initialize coupled GCMs can mitigate climate drift but cannot eliminate it.  Lengthy \"control runs\" of models — made possible by increasing computer power — are one reason for the improvements this paper documents.','published','J. Geophys.

Using control integrations, we compare the simulation of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and its extratropical impact, in models developed for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report with models developed in the late 1990’s (the so-called Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-2 [CMIP2] models). The IPCC models tend to be more realistic in representing the frequency with which ENSO occurs, and they are better at locating enhanced temperature variability over the eastern Pacific Ocean. When compared with reanalyses, the IPCC models have larger pattern correlations of tropical surface air temperature than do the CMIP2 models during the boreal winter peak phase of El Niño. However, for sea-level pressure and precipitation rate anomalies, a clear separation in performance between the two vintages of models is not as apparent. The strongest improvement occurs for the modelling groups whose CMIP2 model tended to have the lowest pattern correlations with observations. This has been checked by subsampling the multi-century IPCC simulations in a manner to be consistent with the single 80-year time segment available from CMIP2. Our results suggest that\r\nmulti-century integrations may be required to statistically assess model improvement of ENSO. The quality of the El Niño precipitation composite is directly related to the fidelity of the boreal winter precipitation\r\nclimatology, highlighting the importance of reducing systematic model error. Over North America distinct improvement of El Niño forced boreal winter surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and precipitation rate anomalies occurs in the IPCC models. This improvement is directly proportional to the skill of the tropical El Niño forced precipitation anomalies.','published','Climate Dynamics','2006','','','10.1007/s00382-006-0119-7','http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-006-0119-7','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-02-27 17:53:38','','achutarao1',1),(15,89,'Emori, S., and S.

The dynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric motion, while the thermodynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric moisture content. The model results consistently show that there are areas with small change or decreases in the thermodynamic change for mean precipitation mainly over subtropics, while the thermodynamic change for extreme precipitation is an overall increase as a result of increased atmospheric moisture. The dynamic changes play a secondary role in the difference between mean and extreme and are limited to lower latitudes. Over many parts of mid- to high latitudes, mean and extreme precipitation increase in comparable magnitude due to a comparable thermodynamic increase. ','published','Geophys. Res.

For a proper representation of ENSO-monsoon relationship, we propose that a realistic simulation of the time-mean monsoon precipitation and evolution of sea surface temperature and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific during ENSO are essential.\r\n \r\nOf the 18 models examined here, only six are found to have realistic representation of monsoon precipitation climatology in the 20c3m integrations, and in the 2xC02 runs, all of them predict an increase (in the range 5-25%) in monsoon precipitation over the Indian sub-continent, as well as an increase in its variability (5-10%).\r\n\r\nFor each of these six models correlation statistics between all-India rainfall (AIR) index and SST over the tropical Indo-Pacific regions for each realization are calculated and then an ensemble mean pattern is computed. Only four models exhibit a robust ENSO-monsoon teleconnection pattern similar to observations, a feature that remains intact and stronger under the climate change scenario. As regards to the timing of the teleconnection, three models represent the observed spring predictability barrier, namely the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three model captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2-3 months after the summer monsoon. In the 20c3m and the 2xCO2 runs (1pctto2x) (1) the overall range and time scales of variation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship remain similar, and (2) there is little consistency in the phase among the individual realizations. Item (1) indicates that there is no evidence for a weakening in the ENSO-monsoon connection due to global warming, and item (2) suggests a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship. Further examination reveals that models that capture the ENSO-monsoon teleconnection have fidelity in correctly simulating the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies during El Nino events, lending credence to our hypothesis. The implication of these results on the monsoon prediction are discussed.','submitted','J.

The poleward shift in baroclinicity is augmented in the Southern Hemisphere and partially offset in the Northern Hemisphere by changes in the surface meridional temperature gradient.

The characteristics examined include mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal to interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and the diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially MRI-CGCM2.3.2a, produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low-latitudes, in contrast to 45-65% in the TRMM satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local sea surface temperature (SST), which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Niño 3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm/day), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (>20 mm/day) precipitation and overestimate them for light (<10 mm/day) precipitation.  The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm/day category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America has intensity comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm/day) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in the new models, and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of world\'s coupled climate models.','published','J.

Chelton','An assessment of the SST influence on surface wind stress in numerical weather prediction and climate models','We analyze the ability of six climate models to capture the observed coupling between SST and surface wind stress in the vicinity of strong midlatitude SST fronts. The analysis emphasizes air-sea interactions associated with ocean meanders in the eastward extensions of major western boundary current systems such as the Gulf Stream, Agulhas, and Kuroshio Currents.  Satellite observations of wind stress from the SeaWinds scatterometer on QuikSCAT and sea surface temperatures from AMSR clearly indicate the influence of SST on surface wind stress on scales smaller than about 30º of longitude by 10º of latitude. Spatially high pass filtered SST and wind stress variations are linearly related, with higher SST associated with higher wind stress.  The influence of SST on wind stress is also clearly identifiable in the ECMWF operational forecast model, having a grid resolution of 0.35 deg x 0.35 deg (T511). The coupling coefficient between wind stress and SST, as indicated by the slope of the linear least squares fit, is only half as strong as for satellite observations, however.  \r\n\r\nThe ability to simulate realistic air-sea interactions is present to varying degrees in the coupled climate models we examine. The MIROC 3-2-HIRES (1.1 deg x 1.1 deg, T106) and the NCAR CCSM3.0 (1.4 deg x 1.4 deg, T85) are the highest resolution models considered and produce the most realistic air-sea coupling associated with midlatitude current systems. Coupling coefficients between SST and wind stress in the MIROC3-2-HIRES and NCAR models are at least comparable to those in the ECMWF operational model. The spatial scales of midlatitude SST variations and SST-induced wind perturbations in the MIROC 3-2-HIRES model are comparable to those of satellite observations. The spatial scales of SST variability in the NCAR model are larger than those in the ECMWF model and satellite observations, and hence the spatial scales of SST-induced perturbations in the wind fields are larger. \r\n\r\nWe find that the ability of climate models to simulate air-sea interactions degrades with decreasing grid resolution.  SST anomalies in the GFDL CM2.0 (2.0 deg x 2.5 deg), UKMO HadCM3 (2.5 deg x 3.8 deg), and MIROC 3-2-MEDRES (2.8 deg x 2.8 deg, T42) models have larger spatial scales and are more geographically confined than in the higher resolution models. The GISS Model E-R (4.0 deg x 5.0 deg) is unable to resolve the midlatitude ocean eddies that produce prominent air-sea interaction.  Notably, the MIROC 3-2-MEDRES model exhibits much weaker coupling between wind stress and SST than the higher vertical and horizontal resolution version of the same model. The GFDL CM2.0 and UKMO HadCM3 models exhibit a linear relationship between SST and wind stress. However, coupling coefficients for the UKMO model are significantly weaker than in the GFDL and higher resolution models. In addition to model grid resolution (both vertical and horizontal), deficiencies in the parameterization of boundary layer processes may be responsible for some of these differences in air-sea coupling between models and observations.\r\n','published','J.

The changes in the frequency of these types and their links to observed rainfall are analysed to further understand the significant, prolonged, rainfall drop observed in this region since 1975. The temporal variability of the different synoptic types link well with the observed rainfall changes. The frequency of the troughs associated with wet conditions across SWWA has declined markedly since 1975 while the frequency of the synoptic types with high pressure over the continent, associated with dry conditions, has increased. Combining the frequency of the synoptic systems with the amount of observed rainfall allows a quantitative analysis of the rainfall decline. The decreased frequency of the troughs associated with very wet conditions accounts for half of the decline. Reductions in the amount of rainfall precipitating from each system also contribute to the decline. Large-scale circulation changes, including increases in the mean sea-level pressure and a decrease in the general baroclinicity of the region have been associated with the rainfall decline. These changes are suggested to be linked to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Due to the strong link between the number of trough types and the rainfall over SWWA, the shifts in the frequency of these synoptic types could be used as a tool to assess simulated rainfall changes, particularly into the future.\r\n','published','Clim.

A step-drop in the 1970s to a new winter rainfall regime has caused great concern for water users in the region. The synoptic systems at the height of winter in the latter half of the 20th century over this region have been described in Hope et al. (Clim Dyn, 2006) using a self-organising map, and in this study the projected future shifts in those systems has been examined. Bounds are placed on the possible responses by examining a number of different models and, into the future, two scenarios at the upper (SRES A2) and lower (SRES B1) limits of plausible human induced emissions. Rainfall taken directly from the models captures the rainfall decline in the 1970s, and, although it is not as large as observed in any one model, all the models express a decline, which is a very strong result. Into the future the rainfall decline is dramatic. The scenario at the upper bound of emissions, where atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise strongly, shows a rainfall decline right through to the end of the century. The shift in synoptic systems for most models is to far fewer troughs and more high pressure systems across the region. One model exhibits a different signature, with a shift to more systems with a zonal structure. The fact that there is a rainfall decline shown by all models, yet the synoptic changes are different, highlights how sensitive SWWA rainfall is to the different responses of climate models to increasing greenhouse gases. In the B1 scenario, the concentrations rise only slowly in the second half of the century and the shift is still to drier conditions, but it is not as striking. These results show that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases lead to increasingly dry conditions in SWWA, and as the atmospheric concentrations rise, the synoptic response intensifies.\r\n','published','Clim.

A Bayesian method is utilized for model evaluation by which model uncertainties are considered systematically. We provide a hierarchical analysis for global to sub-continental regions with two settings. First, regions of different size are evaluated separately at global, hemispheric, continental, and sub-continental scales. Second, the global SAT trend patterns are evaluated with gradual refinement of horizontal scales (higher dimensional analysis). Results show that models with natural plus anthropogenic forcing (MME_ALL) generally exhibit better skill than models with anthropogenic only forcing (MME_ANTH) at all spatial scales for different trend periods (entire twentieth century and its first and second halves). This confirms previous studies that suggest the important role of natural forcing. For the second half of the century, we found that MME_ANTH performs well compared to MME_ALL except for a few models with overestimated warming. This indicates not only major contributions of anthropogenic forcing over that period but also the applicability of both MMEs to observationally-constrained future predictions of climate changes. In addition, the skill-weighted averages with the Bayes factors [Bayesian model averaging (BMA)] show a general superiority over other error-based weighted averaging methods, suggesting a potential advantage of BMA for climate change predictions.

Part I: Global mean surface temperature','A Bayesian approach is applied to the observed global surface air temperature (SAT) changes using multi-model ensembles (MMEs) of the IPCC AR4 simulations and single-model ensembles (SMEs) with the ECHO-G model. A Bayesian decision method is used as a tool for classifying observations into given scenarios (or hypotheses). The prior probability of the scenarios, which represents a degree of subjective belief in the scenarios, is changed into the posterior probability through the likelihood where observations enter, and the posterior is used as a decision function. In the identical-prior case the Bayes factor (or likelihood ratio) becomes a decision function and provides an observational evidence for each scenario against a predefined reference scenario. Four scenarios are used to explain observed SAT changes as \'CTL\' (control or no change), \'Nat\' (natural forcing induced change), \'GHG\' (greenhouse-gas induced change), and \'All\' (natural plus anthropogenic forcing induced change). Observed and simulated global mean SATs are decomposed into temporal components of overall mean, linear trend, and decadal variabilities through Legendre series expansions, coefficients of which are used as detection variables. Parameters (means and covariance matrices) needed to define the four scenarios are estimated from SMEs or MMEs. Taking the \'CTL\' scenario as a reference one, application results for global mean SAT changes for the whole 20th century (1900-1999) show  decisive  evidence (logarithm of Bayes factor > 5) for the \'All\' scenario only. While \'strong\' evidences (log of Bayes factor > 2.5) for both \'Nat\' and \'All\' scenarios are found in SAT changes for the first half (1900- 1949), there is \'decisive\' evidence for the \'All\' scenario for SAT changes in the second half (1950-1999), supporting previous results. It is demonstrated that our Bayesian decision results for global mean SATs are largely insensitive to both inter-model uncertainties and prior probabilities.','published','J.

The Bayes factor or likelihood ratio of each model to the reference model (where mean is identical to the observation) provides a skill ranging from 0 to 1. Four categories of model skill are derived on the basis of the previous studies. Legendre series expansions are used to get a temporally refined model evaluation, which allow efficient analyses of time mean (scale) and linear trend. Application results show that all AOGCMs with natural plus anthropogenic forcing can simulate well the scale and trend of observed global mean SAT changes over the 20th century and its first and second halves. However, more than 50% of the models with anthropogenic forcing only cannot reproduce the observed warming reasonably. This indicates the important role of natural forcing although other factors like different climate sensitivity, forcing uncertainty, and a climate drift might be responsible for the discrepancy in anthropogenic-only models. Besides, Bayesian and conventional skill comparisons demonstrate that a skill-weighted average with the Bayes factors (Bayesian model averaging, BMA) overwhelms the arithmetic ensemble mean and three other weighted averages based on conventional statistics, illuminating future applicability of BMA to climate predictions.','published','Geophys.

Bayesian decision classifies observations into the most probable scenario out of six available scenarios: CTL (control), N (natural forcing), ANTHRO (anthropogenic forcing), G (greenhouse-gas), S (Sulfate aerosols), and ALL (natural plus anthropogenic forcing). Space-time vectors of detection variable are constructed for six continental regions (North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe) by combining temporal components of SATs (expressed as Legendre coefficients) from two or three subregions of each continental region.\r\n\r\nBayesian decision results show that over most of the regions observed SATs are classified into ALL or ANTHRO scenarios for the whole 20th century and its second half. N and ALL scenarios are decided during the first half of the 20th century, but only in the low latitude region (Africa and South America), which might be related to response patterns to solar forcing. Overall seasonal decisions follow annual results, but there are notable seasonal dependences which differ between regions. A comparison of SME and MME results demonstrates that the Bayesian decisions for regional-scale SATs are largely robust to inter-model uncertainties as well as prior probability and temporal scales as found in the global results.','published','J.

Out of the 22 models examined, 14 reproduce the observed shape of the annual cycle well with peak during the boreal summer (June through August), but with varying magnitude. Three models simulate the maximum a month later and with lower magnitudes. Only one model considerably underestimates the magnitude of the annual cycle. The remaining 4 models show some deviations from the observed. Models are unable to simulate the minimum in July with peaks in June and August associated with northward shifts of the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu precipitation band. The realistic simulation of the annual cycle does not appear to depend on the model resolution. The inter-model variation is slightly larger during summer, implying larger diversity of the models in simulating summer monsoon precipitation.\r\n\r\n      The spatial rainfall patterns are reasonably well simulated by most of the models, with several models able to simulate the precipitation associated with the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu frontal zone and that associated with the location of the subtropical high over the north Pacific. Simulated spatial distribution could be sensitive to model resolution as evidenced by two versions of MIROC3.2 model. The multi-model ensemble (MME) pattern reveals an underestimation of seasonal precipitation over the east coast of China, Korea-Japan peninsular and the adjoining oceanic regions. This may be related with the mass-flux based scheme employed for convective parameterization by majority of the models. Further the inter-model variation of precipitation is about 2 times stronger south of 300N, than north of this latitude, indicating larger diversity of the coupled models in simulating low latitude precipitation. The simulated inter-annual variability is estimated by computing the mean summer monsoon seasonal rainfall and the coefficient of variability (CV). In general the mean observed seasonal precipitation of 542 mm and CV of 6.7 % is very well simulated by most of the models. Except for one model mean seasonal precipitation varies from 400 to 650 mm. However the CV varies from 2 to 9 %. \r\n\r\n       Future projections under the radiative forcing of doubled CO2 scenario are examined for individual models and by the MME technique. Changes in mean precipitation and variability are tested by the t-test and F-ratio respectively to evaluate their statistical significance. The changes in mean precipitation vary from -0.6 % (CNRM-CM3) to about 14 % (ECHO-G; UKMO-HadCM3). The MME technique reveals an increase varying from 5 to 10 %, with an average of 7.8 % (greater than the observed CV of 6.7 %) over the East Asian region. However the increases are significant over the Korea-Japan peninsula and the adjoining north China region only. The increases may be attributed to the projected intensification of the subtropical high, Meiyu-Changma-Baiu frontal zone and the associated influx of moist air from the Pacific inland. The projected changes in the amount of precipitation are directly proportional to the projected changes in the strength of the subtropical high. Further the MME suggests a possible increase in the length of the summer monsoon precipitation period from late spring through early autumn. The changes in precipitation could be stabilized by controlling the CO2 emissions.\r\n\r\n','published','Theoretical and Applied Climatology','2007','87','1-28','DOI 10.1007/s00704-006-0238-4','','2006-03-01 01:57:17','2006-10-28 22:30:49','krip','krip',1),(29,100,'Kripalani, R.H., J.H.

Out of the 22 models examined, 19 models are able to capture the maximum rainfall during the summer monsoon period (June through September) with varying amplitude. While 2 models are unable to reproduce the annual cycle well, one model is unable to simulate the summer monsoon season. The simulated inter-annual variability for the 19 models is examined with respect the mean precipitation, coefficient of variation, long-term trends and the biennial tendency. The model simulated mean precipitation varies from 500 mm to 900 mm and coefficient of variation from 3 to 13 %. While 7 models exhibit long-term trends, 8 models are able to simulate the biennial nature of the monsoon rainfall. Six models that generate the most realistic 20th century monsoon climate over South Asia are selected to examine future projections under the doubling CO2 scenario. \r\n       Projections reveal a significant increase in mean monsoon precipitation of 8 % and possible extension of the monsoon period based on the multi-model ensemble technique. Extreme excess and deficient monsoons are projected to intensify. The projected increase in precipitation could be attributed to the projected intensification of the heat low over northwest India, trough of low pressure over the Indo-Gangetic plains and the land-ocean pressure gradient during the establishment phase of the monsoon. The intensification of these pressure systems could be attributed to the decline in winter / spring snowfall. Besides a decrease of winter snowfall over western Eurasia models also project an increase of winter snowfall over Siberia/eastern Eurasia. This projected dipole snow configuration during winter could imply changes in mid-latitude circulation conducive for subsequent summer monsoon precipitation activity. Increase in precipitable water of 12-16 % is projected over major parts of India. However maximum increase of about 20-24 % is projected over the Arabian Peninsula, adjoining regions of Pakistan, northwest India and Nepal. Though the projected summer monsoon circulation appears to weaken, the projected flow over the Bay of Bengal (Arabian Sea) will support oceanic moisture convergence towards the southern parts of India and Sri Lanka (northwest India and adjoining regions).

This would correspond to an average return period of such anomalous warm seasons of almost one year. The reliability of these results is assessed using the bounding box technique, previously used to quantify the reliability of seasonal climate forecasts. It is shown that the dramatic increase in extreme warm seasons arises from the combined effect of a shift and a broadening of the temperature distributions. ','published','Geophys. Res.

Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks.

The models exhibit a mean fractional decrease in ENSO period of about 5%.  Although many factors can influence ENSO period, it is suggested that this may be related to a comparable increase in equatorial wave speed through an associated speedup of delayed-oscillator feedback.

The emphasis of our work is decadal variability of the shallow meridional overturning circulation, which links the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. In observations, this circulation is characterized by equatorward geostrophic volume transport convergence in the interior ocean pycnocline across 9$^{\\\\circ}$N and 9$^{\\\\circ}$S. Historical hydrographic data indicate that there has been a decreasing trend in this convergence over the period 1953-2001 of about 11 Sverdrup (1 Sv=10$^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$), with maximum decade-to-decade variations of 7-11 Sv. The transport time series is highly anti-correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, implying that variations in meridional overturning circulation are directly linked to decadal variability and trends in tropical SST. These relationships are explored in 18 model simulations of 20th century climate from 14 state-of-the-art coupled climate models. Significant correlation exists between meridional volume transport convergence and tropical SST in the majority of the models over the last half century. However, the magnitude of transport variability on decadal time scales in the models is underestimated while at the same time modeled SST variations are more sensitive to that transport variability than in the observations. The effects of the meridional overturning circulation on SST trends in most the models is less clear. Most models show no trend in meridional transport convergence and underestimate the trend in eastern tropical Pacific SST. The eddy permitting MIROCH model is the only model that reasonably reproduces the observed trends in transport convergence, tropical Pacific SST, and SST gradient along the equator over the last half century. If the observed trends and those simulated in the MIROCH model are ultimately related to greenhouse gas forcing, these results suggest that the Bjerknes feedback, by affecting pycnocline transport convergences, may enhance warming that arises from anthropogenic forcing in the eastern tropical Pacific.','published','Ocean Modelling','2006','15','250-273','doi:10.1016/j.ocemod.2005.12.005','http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.ocemod.2005.12.005','2006-03-01 13:44:29','2007-01-08 11:33:45','zhang','zhang',1),(202,35,'Haibin Li, Alan Robock, and Martin Wild','Evaluation of IPCC AR4 Soil Moisture Simulations for the Second Half of the Twentieth Century','Soil moisture trends, particularly during the growing season, are an important possible consequence of global warming.  Climate model simulations of future soil moisture changes should be made with models that can produce reliable simulations of soil moisture for past climate changes.  In this paper, we compare soil moisture simulations from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment climate models forced with observed climate forcings for the past century, and evaluate them using in situ soil moisture measurements from over 140 stations or districts in mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.  To account for the observed spatial scale of soil moisture variations, we used regionally-averaged soil moisture for six regions.  The models showed realistic seasonal cycles for Ukraine, Russia, and Illinois, but generally poor seasonal cycles for Mongolia and China.  \r\n	To explore the summer drying issue for the second half of the 20th century, we analyzed the linear trend of soil moisture for Ukraine and Russia.  Observations from both regions show increases in summer for the period from 1958-1999 that were larger than most trends in the model simulations.  Only two out of 25 model realizations show trends comparable to those of observations.  These two trends, however, are due to internal model variability rather than a result of external forcing.  Changes in precipitation and temperature cannot fully explain soil moisture increases for Ukraine and Russia, which indicates that other factors might have played a dominant role on the observed patterns for soil moisture.  We suggest that changes in solar irradiance (the dimming effect) and resultant changes in evaporative demand explain most of the observed soil moisture trends.  To understand such sensitivity, we analyzed soil moisture outputs in a special version of the ECHAM5 model that was capable of capturing the observed radiation pattern as a result of incorporating a sophisticated aerosol scheme.  Results suggest that both radiation and precipitation patterns are required to be adequately simulated to reproduce the observed soil moisture trends realistically. \r\n','in_press','J. Geophys.

Only a few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of warming (cooling) during 1901-1940 (1940-1979).  Those models with multiple runs (identical forcing but different initial conditions) showed considerable intra-model variability with trends varying by up to 1.8°C/century, suggesting that the historical forcings did not produce consistent trends while internal dynamic variability played a major role at the regional scale.  The wide range of trend outcomes, particularly for those models with multiple runs, and the small number of simulations similar to observations in both the forced and unforced experiments suggest that the warming hole is not a robust response to the estimated external forcings; a more likely explanation is an unusually large realization of internal dynamic variability combined with external forcing.  \r\nThe observed CUS temperature variations are positively correlated with north Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and both NA SSTs and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs.  Most models simulate rather well the connection between CUS temperature and NA SSTs.  However, the teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between CEP SSTs and CUS temperature are poorly simulated and the models produce substantially less NA SST variability than observed, perhaps hampering their ability to reproduce the warming hole.   \r\n\r\n','published','J.

In high-latitude rivers (Amur, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob, Yenisei, and Yukon), the discharge increases, and the peak timing shifts earlier due to an earlier snowmelt caused by global warming.

The analysis indicates that the CO2-induced response pattern is related with the model natural variability modes, ENSO and AO. In the tropical Pacific, an ENSO-like global warming pattern is simulated by the majority of the models with mostly El Niño-like change. In the Arctic region, an AO-like global warming pattern is simulated by many models, with the positive definite AO-phase change if AO-like. It is suggested that the increase in meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere provides a preferable condition for the positive AO-like change in the high latitudes by intensifying the subtropical jet, while the increase in the static stability provides a preferable condition for the El Niño-like change in the low latitudes by reducing the large-scale ambient circulations. However, the sign of the mass (SLP) anomaly is incompatible over the North Pacific between the positive AO-like change and the El Niño-like change. As a result, the present models cannot fully determine the relative importance between the mechanisms inducing the positive AO-like change and inducing the ENSO-like change, leading to scatter in global warming patterns in regional scales over the North Pacific.','published','J.

This issue is illustrated over Sudan and Sahel using the outputs of eleven coupled general circulation models having participated in the latest IPCC simulations. Like in situ observations, models show a strong relationship between detrended seasonal anomalies of surface air temperature and precipitation during the summer monsoon season.

The current staus of these projections is assessed by examining a large set of climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Firstly, the patterns and time series of present-day ENSO-like model variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean are compared with that observed. Next, the strength of the coupled atmosphere-ocean feedback loops responsible for generating the ENSO cycle in the models are evaluated. Finally, we consider the projections of the models with, what we consider to be, the most realistic ENSO variability. \r\n\r\nTwo of the models considered do not have interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Three models show a very regular ENSO cycle due to a strong local wind feedback in the central Pacific and weak sea surface temperature (SST) damping. Six other models have a higher frequency ENSO cycle than observed due to a weak east Pacific upwelling feedback loop. One model has much stronger upwelling feedback than observed, and another one cannot be described simply by the analysis technique. The remaining six models have a reasonable balance of feedback mechanisms and in four of these the interannual mode also resembles the observed ENSO both spatially and temporally. \r\n\r\nOver the period 2051-2100 (under various scenarios) the most realistic six models show either no change in the mean state or a slight shift towards El Niño-like conditions with an amplitude at most a quarter of the present day interannual standard deviation. We see no statistically significant changes in amplitude of ENSO variability in the future, with changes in the standard deviation of a Southern Oscillation Index that are no larger than observed decadal variations. Uncertainties in the skewness of the variability are too large to make any statements about the future relative strength of El Niño and La Niña events. Based on this analysis of the multi-model ensemble, we expect very little influence of global warming on ENSO. \r\n\r\n','published','Ocean Science','2005','1','81-95','','http://www.copernicus.org/EGU/os/os/1/81/os-1-81.htm','2006-03-02 01:34:08','2006-03-02 01:34:08','matcollins','matcollins',0),(52,413,'Collins, M., Booth, B.B.B., Harris, G., Murphy, J.M., Sexton, D.M.H., Webb, M.','Towards Quantifying Uncertainty in Transient Climate Change.','Ensembles of coupled atmosphere–ocean global circulation model simulations are required to make probabilistic predictions of future climate change. “Perturbed physics” ensembles provide a new approach in which modelling uncertainties are sampled systematically by perturbing uncertain parameters. The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere–ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20 year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5–2.6°C, similar to that found in multi-model studies. Measures of global and large scale climate change from the coupled models show simple relationships with associated measures computed from atmosphere-mixed-layer-ocean climate change experiments, suggesting that recent advances in computing the probability density function of climate change under equilibrium conditions using the perturbed physics approach may be extended to the transient case. \r\n','published','Climate Dynamics','2006','27','127-147','DOI: 10.1007/s00382-006-0121-0','http://www.springerlink.com/content/047645k603573058/fulltext.html','2006-03-02 01:37:31','2007-02-27 06:24:00','matcollins','matcollins',1),(229,611,'Gnanadesikan, A. and R.J.

The study uses daily output from seven GCMs run under late 20th century and projected 21st century radiative conditions (SRES A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario).  We define a CAO as an occurrence of two or more consecutive days during which the local mean daily surface air temperature is at least two standard deviations below the local wintertime mean temperature.  In agreement with observations, the models generally simulate modern CAOs most frequently over western North America and Europe and least commonly over the Arctic.  These favored regions for CAOs are located downstream from preferred locations of atmospheric blocking.  Future projections indicate that CAOs—defined with respect to late 20th century climatic conditions—decline in frequency by 50 to 100% in most of the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century.  Certain regions, however, show relatively small changes and others actually experience more CAOs in the future, due to atmospheric circulation changes and internal variability that counter the thermodynamic tendency from greenhouse forcing.  These areas generally experience greater near-surface wind flow from the north or of more continental origin during the 21st century and/or are especially prone to atmospheric blocking events.  Simulated reductions in CAOs are smallest in western North America, the North Atlantic, and in southern regions of Europe and Asia.  The Eurasian pattern is driven by a strong tendency for the models to produce SLP increases in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea (intermodel mean of 3 hPa), causing greater advection of continental air from northern and central Asia, while the muted change over western North America is due to enhanced ridging along the west coast and the increased frequency of blocking events.  The North Atlantic response is consistent with a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, which either damps the warming regionally or results in a cooler mean climate in the vicinity of Greenland.','published','International Journal of Climatology','2006','26','1133-1147','','','2006-03-02 07:47:52','2007-02-27 07:28:35','vavrus','vavrus',1),(54,419,'Li, W., R.

Five of the eleven models predict an increase of annual rainfall, three models predict a decrease of rainfall, and the other three models predict no significant changes in the Amazon rainfall.  We have further examined two models.  The UKMO-HadCM3 model predicts an El Niño-like sea surface temperature (SST) change and warming in the northern tropical Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the Amazon.  The resultant increase of surface solar absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the surface air.  These changes decrease the rate and length of wet season rainfall and surface latent heat flux.  This decreased wet season rainfall leads to drier soil during the subsequent dry season, which in turn can delay the transition from the dry to wet season.   \r\n     GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming in the western Pacific and the southern tropical Atlantic which increases moisture transport and hence rainfall in the Amazon.

The most comprehensive tools for simulating past and future climates influenced by WMGHGs are fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Because of the importance of WMGHGs as forcing agents, it is essential that AOGCMs compute the radiative forcing by these gases as accurately as possible. We present the results of a Radiative-Transfer Model Intercomparison (RTMIP) between the forcings computed by the radiative parameterizations of AOGCMs and by benchmark line-by-line (LBL) codes. The comparison is focused on forcing by CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, and the increased H2O expected in warmer climates. The models included in the intercomparison include several LBL codes and most of the global models submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4). In general, the LBL models are in excellent agreement with each other. However, in many cases, there are substantial discrepancies among the AOGCMs and between the AOGCMs and LBL codes. In some cases this is because the AOGCMs neglect particular absorbers, in particular the near-infrared effects of CH4 and N2O, while in others it is due to the methods for modeling the radiative processes. The biases in the AOGCM forcings are generally largest at the surface level.

Hydroclimate teleconnections that lean on stationary component of the flow, such as surface air temperature\r\nlinks, are however not well modeled by HADCM3 since the midlatitude ridge in the ENSO response is incorrectly placed in the simulation; PCM fares better.\r\nThe analysis reveals that climate models are improving but still unable to simulate many features of ENSO variability and its circulation and hydroclimate teleconnections to North America. Predicting regional climate variability/change remains an onerous burden on models.','accepted','J.

Most models show that, in Asia, the summer monsoon rainfall increases significantly with global warming. On the other hand, the future change in the large-scale flow indicates a weakening of the ASM circulation. Enhanced moisture transport over the Asian summer monsoon region, associated with the increased moisture source from the warmer Indian Ocean, leads to a larger moisture flux convergence, which is responsible for the intensification of the mean rainfall. Pronounced warming over the tropics in the middle-to-upper troposphere causes a reduction in the meridional thermal gradient in the Asian region, which is consistent with the weakened monsoon circulation and eastward shift of the Walker circulation.

The current staus of these projections is assessed by examining a large set of climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Firstly, the patterns and time series of present-day ENSO-like model variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean are compared with that observed. Next, the strength of the coupled atmosphere-ocean feedback loops responsible for generating the ENSO cycle in the models are evaluated. Finally, we consider the projections of the models with, what we consider to be, the most realistic ENSO variability.\r\n\r\nTwo of the models considered do not have interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Three models show a very regular ENSO cycle due to a strong local wind feedback in the central Pacific and weak sea surface temperature (SST) damping. Six other models have a higher frequency ENSO cycle than observed due to a weak east Pacific upwelling feedback loop. One model has much stronger upwelling feedback than observed, and another one cannot be described simply by the analysis technique. The remaining six models have a reasonable balance of feedback mechanisms and in four of these the interannual mode also resembles the observed ENSO both spatially and temporally.\r\n\r\nOver the period 2051-2100 (under various scenarios) the most realistic six models show either no change in the mean state or a slight shift towards El Niño-like conditions with an amplitude at most a quarter of the present day interannual standard deviation. We see no statistically significant changes in amplitude of ENSO variability in the future, with changes in the standard deviation of a Southern Oscillation Index that are no larger than observed decadal variations. Uncertainties in the skewness of the variability are too large to make any statements about the future relative strength of El Niño and La Niña events. Based on this analysis of the multi-model ensemble, we expect very little influence of global warming on ENSO.

We adopt the classical approach of computing the Hayashi spectra of the 500hPa geopotential height fields and we introduce an ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral sub-domains. The total wave variability is taken as a global scalar metrics describing the overall performance of each model, while the total variability pertaining to the eastward propagating baroclinic waves and to the planetary waves are taken as scalar metrics describing the performance of each model in describing the corresponding specific physical process. We obtain that large biases, in most cases larger than 20%, are found in all the considered metrics between the wave climatologies of most IPCC models and the reanalises. The span of the climatologies of the various models is in all cases over 50% of the climatology of the reanalises. In particular, the baroclinic waves are typically overestimated by the climate models, while the planetary waves are usually underestimated. This closely resembles the results of many diagnostic studies performed in the past on global weather forecasting models. The vertical resolution of the atmosphere and, somewhat unexpectedly, of the adopted ocean model seem to be critical in determining the agreement of the climate models with the reanalyses.

Many models showed serious large-scale deficiencies in the simulated patterns, especially at mid-latitudes. Five models performed well at all latitudes and for each month of the year. Three models had a reasonable skill.\r\n\r\nWe selected the five models with the best pressure patterns for a more detailed assessment of their simulations of the climate in Central Europe. We analysed observations and simulations of monthly mean geostrophic flow indices and of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. We used three geostrophic flow indices: the west component and south component of the geostrophic wind at the surface and the geostrophic vorticity. We found that circulation biases were important, and affected precipitation in particular. Apart from these circulation biases, the models show other biases in temperature and precipitation, which were for some models larger than the circulation induced biases. Despite these deficiencies, the models do simulate many aspects of the observed climate quite well.\r\n\r\nFor the 21st century the models simulated quite different changes in circulation, precipitation and temperature. Precipitation changes appear to be primarily caused by circulation changes. Since the models show widely different circulation changes, especially in late summer, precipitation changes vary widely between the models as well. Some models simulate severe drying in late summer, while one model simulates significant precipitation increases in late summer. With respect to the mean temperature the circulation changes were important, but not dominant. However, changes in the distribution of monthly mean temperatures, do show large indirect influences of circulation changes. Especially in late summer, two models simulate very strong warming of warm months, which can be attributed to severe summer drying in the simulations by these models. The models differ also significantly in the simulated warming of cold winter months. Finally, the models simulate rather different changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature, which is likely to impact on changes in temperature and precipitation. These results imply that several important aspects of climate change in Central Europe are highly uncertain.\r\n','published','Atm. Chem.

Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow.

For the enhanced greenhouse warming experiments, the models simulated a reduction in the total number of events and an increase in the number of intense events. This is a robust result, which essentially all the models exhibit. Comparison of the results for each of the scenarios shows that the magnitude of the changes in the number of simulated events increases with increasing levels greenhouse gas forcing used in the scenarios. Even though the numbers of events change, there is no apparent change seen in the geographical distribution of the events; i.e., there is no obvious change in the positions of the storm tracks seen on hemispheric charts. This was also evident in the results for the filtered variance of the meridional wind which was used as a proxy for cyclone activity. In spite of this, it is possible that small shifts in the storm tracks, which are difficult to resolve with the relatively coarse grid used for analysis, could occur.','in_press','Climate Dynamics','2006','','','DOI: 10.1007/s00382-006-0110-3','http://www.springerlink.com/(0qv5wnjeytpgohbzhyibgp55)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,17,29;journal,1,193;browsepublicationsresults,249,1552;','2006-03-03 12:31:23','2006-03-03 12:31:23','acrnrjf','acrnrjf',1),(68,42,'Neelin, J.

The simulations were compared to the NCAR–NCEP reanalyses. The models simulate a SAO which differs spatially from the observed over the Pacific and Indian oceans. The amplitudes are too high over the southern ocean and too low over the midlatitudes. These differences are attributed to a circumpolar trough which is too deep and extends too far north, and to the inability of the models to simulate the middle to high latitude temperature gradient. The SAM is well-represented spatially by most models but there are important differences which may influence the flow over the Pacific and in the region extending from the Ross to Weddell Seas. The observed trend towards positive polarity in the SAM is apparent in the ensemble averages of the GISS-ER and CCSM3 simulations, suggesting that the trend is due to external forcing by changes in the concentration of ozone and greenhouse gases. ZW3 is well-represented by the models but the observed trend towards positive phases of ZW3 is not apparent in the simulations suggesting that the observed trend may be due to natural variability, not external forcing.','published','Climate Dynamics','2006','26','217-228','DOI: 10.1007/s00382-005-0082-8','','2006-03-06 13:18:28','2006-07-17 14:17:54','mholland','taylor13',1),(71,84,'Holland, Marika M. and Marilyn N.

The simulations exhibit a largely seasonal southern hemisphere ice cover, as observed. There is a considerable scatter in the monthly simulated climatological ice extent among different models, but no consistent bias when compared to observations. The scatter in maximum winter ice extent among different models is correlated to the strength of the climatological zonal winds suggesting that wind forced ice transport is responsible for much of this scatter. Observations show that the leading mode of southern hemisphere ice variability exhibits a dipole structure with anomalies of one sign in the Atlantic sector associated with anomalies of the opposite sign in the Pacific sector. The observed ice anomalies also exhibit eastward propagation with the Antarctic circumpolar current, as part of the documented Antarctic circumpolar wave phenomenon. Many of the models do simulate dipole-like behavior in sea ice anomalies as the leading mode of ice variability, but there is a large discrepancy in the eastward propagation of these anomalies among the different models. Consistent with observations, the simulated Antarctic dipole-like variations in the ice cover are led by sea-level pressure anomalies in the Amundsen/ Bellingshausen Sea. These are associated, to different degrees in different models, with both the southern annular mode and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are indications that the magnitude of the influence of ENSO on the southern hemisphere ice cover is related to the strength of ENSO events simulated by the different models.','published','Climate Dynamics','2006','26','229-245','DOI: 10.1007/s00382-005-0087-3','','2006-03-06 13:20:08','2006-07-17 14:17:31','mholland','taylor13',1),(72,126,'Benestad, R.E.','Can we expect more extreme precipitation on the monthly time scale?','The IPCC third assessment report states that instrumental records show an increase in precipitation by +0.5--1% per decade in much of the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes and a decrease of -0.3%/decade over sub-tropical land areas.

The study begins with an analysis of the monsoon simulation in the twentieth-century integrations. Six of the 18 models were found to have a reasonably realistic representation of monsoon precipitation climatology. For each of these six models SST and anomalous precipitation evolution along the equatorial Pacific during El Niño events display considerable differences when compared to observations. Out of these six models only four [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model versions 2.0 and 2.1 (GFDL_CM_2.0 and GFDL_CM_2.1), Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) model, and Max Planck Institute ECHAM5 (MPI_ECHAM5)] exhibit a robust ENSO–monsoon contemporaneous teleconnection, including the known inverse relationship between ENSO and rainfall variations over India. Lagged correlations between the all-India rainfall (AIR) index and Niño-3.4 SST reveal that three models represent the timing of the teleconnection, including the spring predictability barrier, which is manifested as the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three models (GFDL_CM_2.1) captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2–3 months after the summer monsoon, which is partially attributable to the intensity of the simulated El Niño itself. The authors find that the models that best capture the ENSO–monsoon teleconnection are those that correctly simulate the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific and the associated changes to the equatorial Walker circulation during El Niño events.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the AIR-Niño-3.4 SST correlation in the model runs waxes and wanes to some degree on decadal time scales. The overall magnitude and time scale for this decadal modulation in most of the models is similar to that seen in observations. However, there is little consistency in the phase among the realizations, suggesting a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon–ENSO relationship.\r\n\r\nThe analysis was repeated for each of the four models using results from integrations in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration was raised to twice preindustrial values. From these “best” models in the double CO2 simulations there are increases in both the mean monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent (by 5%–25%) and in its interannual variability (5%–10%). For each model the ENSO–monsoon correlation in the global warming runs is very similar to that in the twentieth-century runs, suggesting that the ENSO–monsoon connection will not weaken as global climate warms. This result, though plausible, needs to be taken with some caution because of the diversity in the simulation of ENSO variability in the coupled models that have been analyzed. Implications of the present results for monsoon prediction are discussed.\r\n\r\n','published','J.

Rapid changes observed in the global climate over the past 100 years compared to those estimates of climate change over the past 1000 years motivated researchers worldwide to study the forcing factors causing such changes in the climate.  General circulation models (GCMs) are used to analyze the climate change on a global scale.  However, it is an established fact that GCMs are not very efficient in representing regional climate.  Impact studies, such as studying the effect of climate change on agricultural practices; water resources, etc, are carried out on a regional scale because the impact is specific to a given region.  In current project reported herein, the regional climate impact study is carried out for the Brazos River Basin in West Texas.\r\n\r\nOwing to the low precipitation rates and high potential evapotranspiration rates of the West Texas region, it is important to understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle of the region.  The main aim of the research reported herein is to analyze those changes and provide results to the policy makers so they could set up policies for the future in accordance to the changes projected by the models.  \r\n\r\nThe first step of the project was to choose a GCM that represents the climate forcings of the West Texas region. GCM grid outputs were used as input boundary conditions for a regional climate model.  The selection of the GCM was based on a careful comparison of the output from 15 GCMs.  The comparison was based on two parameters, climate uncertainty and socio-economic uncertainty.  The climate uncertainty was addressed by comparing the climate change as projected by several models.  The socio-economic uncertainty was addressed by comparing the climate projections by models for different IPCC SRES3 scenarios.  Scenarios A2 and B1 were chosen for this project because they represent the worst and best climate change scenarios, respectively.  In order to select the appropriate GCM for the study area, the output from each model has to be studied to observe how they represent the climate forcings affecting the climate change in the study \r\narea. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this paper is to present results from comparison of 15 GCM models for use in north-central Texas.  The results will be applied to an ongoing study of the Upper Brazos River Basin water resources to determine the potential impact of climate change on the water resources of that basin.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n1 Ph.D. Candidate, Civil Engineering Department, Texas Tech University, P.O.

D.B.','Use Of Rcm To Study The Impact Of Climate Change On Water Resources In The Upper Brazos River Basin','Global climate models (GCMs) have proven to be a valuable tool for investigating the impact of man-made green house gases on Earth’s climate.  The immediate impact of global warming is increased temperatures.  In early 1990s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated a rise in global mean temperatures of 1.5oC to 4.5oC.  The indirect impacts of the climate change include: normal summers but warmer winters; normal daily high temperatures, but warmer nighttime lows; increases in extreme precipitation events (Karl, 1997); and changes in the hydrologic cycle including increased cloudiness.  The rapid progress in computer technologies has allowed for horizontal resolution of the order of several hundred kilometers and advanced treatment of physics in GCMs.  Although global effects are important, the more immediate impacts on humans will be on the regional and local scales.  Therefore it is not practical to predict demands for water, electricity, or agricultural aid based on a global perspective.  The description of the Hydrologic Cycle improves with increasing resolution due to the better topographical representation.  Therefore it is imperative to study regional scale climatic changes.  In this project, the study is concentrated on the Upper Brazos River region in the South Western United States.\r\n\r\nIn response to increased fresh water use by humans, water resources planners have developed new approaches for optimizing use of existing water supplies.  For the semi-arid High Plains and Low Rolling Plains areas of Texas, optimal use of water supplies is critical.  The water resources of this region are limited by the combination of low rainfall rates of 20 inches or less per year and potential evapotranspiration rates of up to 100 inches per year.  Water resources planners have a challenging task in allocating scarce water resources.  However, current planning methods rely on historic meteorologic data to determine expected water yields.  The possibility that climate change could dramatically alter current hydrologic systems and invalidate projections of firm yield should be examined.  \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop a method of transferring climate change as predicted by a Regional Climate Model to assess the Brazos River Basin water resources system.  The study involves developing a Regional Climate Model for 1XCO2 and 2XCO2 scenarios using the Modular Modeling System (MMS) developed by USGS.    The results obtained by a GCM are used as the boundary conditions for the Regional Climate Model.  The CSIRO Mark 2 GCM model was used to generate a GCM for the study area.  The other objective of the project is to compare the dynamic regional model generated by the MMS with the downscaled statistical model already generated for this region by Troy Dorman (2003).  The climate change data obtained by the Regional Climate Model will be used to assess the likely impact of changes on the Hydrologic Cycle in the Brazos River Basin.  The changes in the Evapotranspiration levels and the recharge due to the Climate Change will also be analyzed.\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS\r\n\r\nRegional climate modeling, GCMs, Brazos river basin water resources, weather prediction, climate modeling, MMS.  \r\n','published','Texas Water 2004 Conference Proceedings, Annual Conference, April 5-8','2004','','','','','2006-03-07 13:17:32','2006-03-07 13:20:49','spandana28','spandana28',1),(78,82,'Maurer, E.P.','Uncertainty in hydrologic impacts of climate change in the Sierra Nevada, California under two emissions scenarios','A hydrologic model was driven by the climate projected by 11 GCMs under two emissions scenarios (the higher emission SRESA2 and the lower emission SRESB1) to investigate whether the projected hydrologic changes by 2071-2100 have a high statistical confidence, and to determine the confidence level that the A2 and B1 emissions scenarios produce differing impacts. There are highly significant average temperature increases by 2071-2100 of 3.7°C under A2 and 2.4°C under B1; July increases are 5°C for A2 and 3°C for B1. Two high confidence hydrologic impacts are increasing Winter streamflow and decreasing late Spring and Summer flow. Less snow at the end of Winter is a confident projection, as is earlier arrival of the annual flow volume, which has important implications on California water management. The two emissions pathways show some differing impacts with high confidence: the degree of warming expected; the amount of decline in summer low flows; the shift to earlier streamflow timing; and the decline in end-of-winter snow pack, with more extreme impacts under higher emissions in all cases. This indicates that future emissions scenarios play a significant role in the degree of impacts to water resources in California.\r\n\r\nManuscript (accepted 12 July 2006) available on-line: <a href=\"http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/papers/maurer_ipcc_manuscript.pdf\">http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/papers/maurer_ipcc_manuscript.pdf</a>','published','Climatic Change','2007','82','309-325','doi:10.1007/s10584-006-9180-9','','2006-03-07 18:00:21','2007-08-06 16:01:19','emaurer','emaurer',1),(79,155,'Gorodetskaya, I.

The models are:  Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE Version R (GISS-ER), the UK Met Office Hadley Centre Model (UKMO HadCM3), and the National Center for Atmosphere Research Climate Community System Model (NCAR CCSM3). The models agree with each other and with observations of high Arctic mean cloud fraction in summer, however, large differences are found in the cloud ice and liquid water contents. Of the three models analyzed, the simulated Arctic clouds of the CCSM3 model have the highest liquid water content, exceeding the observed values. The clouds in the GISS-ER model are characterized by extremely high ice content and little liquid water content, and the HadCM3 model clouds hold moderate amounts of ice and relatively small amounts of liquid water. In the CCSM3 model, the high surface albedo and strong cloud short-wave radiative forcing both significantly decrease the amount of short-wave radiation absorbed by the Arctic Ocean surface during the summer. In the GISS-ER and HadCM3 models, the surface and cloud effects compensate: the first model with higher summer surface albedo has a larger downwelling short-wave flux, compared to the latter model with the lower surface albedo. Due to the differences in the models\' cloud and surface properties, the Arctic Ocean surface gains about 20\\% and 40\\% more energy during the melt period in the GISS-ER and HadCM3 models, respectively, compared to the CCSM3 model. The HadCM3 model shows the largest reduction in both the sea ice area and volume during the summer consistent with the largest surface net short-wave radiation. In GISS-ER large winter sea ice thickness impairs the sea ice area reduction during the melt period counteracting the excessive net short-wave flux, while CCSM3 shows a significant decrease in both the sea ice area and volume during the summer despite the net short-wave flux deficiency. Substantial decrease in the sea ice area predicted by the end of the 21st Century in the CCSM3 model is associated with the large drop in the surface albedo, which is only partly compensated by the increased cloud short-wave forcing. In the HadCM3 and GISS-ER models, however, the compensation of the surface albedo and cloud short-wave forcing effects is one of the factors explaining moderate future sea ice volume trends. \r\n','submitted','J.

Such regional assessments are sometimes questioned, however, by the perceived failure of global climate models to reproduce key processes responsible for regional trends. Here, we systematically compare observed climate over the U.S. Northeast (NE) with historical and future simulations from eight global models and two downscaling approaches to answer two key questions. First, to what degree are the global models able to simulate regional circulation patterns and their relationship to surface climate in the NE? How much confidence should we then place in future projections of climate change at the regional level? Some uncertainty remains to be resolved, particularly related to the influence of large-scale teleconnection patterns on surface climate characteristics over a topographically diverse region such as the NE. However, the primary changes projected to occur in climate over the next century – namely, slightly greater temperature increases in summer as compared with winter, and increases in winter precipitation – are consistent with projected trends in regional climate processes and are relatively independent of model or scale. Furthermore, downscaling produces accurate representations of temporal and spatial distributions of climate across the region. Together, these suggest confidence in the direction and potential range of the most notable regional climate trends, with the absolute magnitude of change depending on both the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing as well as the emissions pathway we follow over the next century.','in_preparation','','2008','','','','','2006-03-07 21:15:02','2007-12-20 20:42:15','hayhoe','hayhoe',1),(81,354,'Hayhoe, K., Wake, C., Huntington, T., Luo, L., Schwartz, M.D., Sheffield, J., Wood, E., Anderson, B., Bradbury, J., DeGaetano, A., Troy, T.J and Wolfe, D.','Past and future changes in climate and hydrological indicators in the U.S. Northeast','Assessing the potential impacts of global climate change on a specific region requires integrating projected changes with the unique regional characteristics that will affect and modify those changes at the regional scale. Focusing on key climate indicators in the U.S. Northeast, we assess the extent to which multiple simulations of 20th century climate from 9 AR4 AOGCMs are able to reproduce observed changes in these indicators, and evaluate projected future trends in primary climate characteristics and indicators of change. The analysis encompasses a range of climate indicators that characterize the region, including heavy rainfall and drought, the depth and extent of snow cover, soil moisture, and streamflow in unmanaged rivers, and changes in biometeorological indicators that depend on accumulated temperature and precipitation, such as growing season, frost days, and Spring Indices. Projected changes in almost all of the temperature-related climate indicators all show signals consistent with warming temperatures across both observations and a broad range of past and future model simulations. In the future, model simulations indicate significantly larger increases under the SRES mid-high (A2) and higher (A1FI) as compared to the lower (B1) emissions scenario. These findings highlight the on-going influence of climate change on a wide range of regional indicators, providing confidence regarding the direction, and guidance regarding the magnitude, of many regional climate trends, many of which appear to depend fundamentally upon the emission pathways followed over the next century.','published','Climate Dynamics','2007','28','','doi:10.1007/s00382-006-0187-8','http://www.springerlink.com/content/b5746164l0t21l42/?p=f19f79fe5f0c4bb1b178a2e80084aee6&pi=2','2006-03-07 21:16:51','2007-12-20 20:36:15','hayhoe','hayhoe',1),(82,22,'Bender, F.

For an annual and area-average warming exceeding 4.5+-0.9 K in Greenland, and 3.1+-0.8 K in the global average, the net surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet becomes negative, in which case it is likely that the ice sheet would eventually be eliminated, raising global-average sea level by 7 m.\r\n','in_press','Phil Trans Roy Soc A','','','','','','2006-03-08 08:59:48','2006-03-08 08:59:48','jmgregory','jmgregory',1),(84,104,'Carril A.

Equally, the winter time of 2046-2065 is largely indistinguishable from 1961-1990 for the majority of stations, while the winters of 2081-2100 appear to be associated with lower mean and 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density.','published','Climate Research','2005','29','183-198','','','2006-03-10 11:02:52','2006-03-10 11:02:52','spryor','spryor',1),(87,10,'Lin, J.L., G.N.

Part I: Convective signals','This study evaluates the tropical intraseasonal variability, especially the fidelity of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) simulations, in 14 coupled general circulation models (GCMs) participating in the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Eight years of daily precipitation from each model’s 20th century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite retrieved precipitation. Space-time spectral analysis is used to obtain the variance and phase speed of dominant convectively coupled equatorial waves, including the MJO, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby (ER), mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG), and eastward inertio-gravity\r\n(EIG) and westward inertio-gravity (WIG) waves. The variance and propagation of the MJO, defined as the eastward wavenumbers 1-6, 30-70 day mode, are examined in detail.\r\n\r\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs still have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the tropical intraseasonal variability. The total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance of precipitation is too weak in most of the models. About half of the models have signals of convectively coupled equatorial waves, with Kelvin and MRG-EIG waves especially prominent. However, the variances are generally too weak for all wave modes except the EIG wave, and the phase speeds are generally too fast, being scaled to excessively deep equivalent depths. An interesting\r\nresult is that this scaling is consistent within a given model across modes, in that both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes scale similarly to a certain equivalent depth. Excessively deep equivalent depths suggest that these models may not have a large enough reduction in their “effective static stability” by diabatic heating.\r\n\r\nThe MJO variance approaches the observed value in only two of the 14 models, but is less than half of the observed value in the other 12 models. The ratio between the eastward MJO variance and the variance of its westward counterpart is too small in most of the models, which is consistent with the lack of highly coherent eastward propagation of the MJO in many models. Moreover, the MJO variance in 13 of the 14 models does not come from a pronounced spectral peak, but usually comes from part of an overreddened spectrum, which in turn is associated with too strong persistence of equatorial precipitation. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the MJO are the only ones having convective closures/triggers linked in some way to moisture convergence.','published','J.

The models show a clear improvement over previous generations in simulating the tropical Pacific climatology. Systematic biases still include too strong mean and seasonal cycle of trade winds. El Niño amplitude is shown to be an inverse function of the mean trade winds in agreement with the observed shift of 1976 and with theoretical studies. El Niño amplitude is further shown to be an inverse function of the relative strength of the seasonal cycle. When most of the energy is within the seasonal cycle, little is left for inter-annual signals and vice versa. An Interannual Coupling Strength (ICS) is defined and its relation with the modelled El Niño frequency is compared to that predicted by theoretical models. An assessment of the modelled El Niño in term of SST mode (S-mode) or thermocline mode (T-mode) shows that most models are locked into a S-mode and that only a few models exhibit a hybrid mode, like in observations. It is concluded that several basic El Niño – mean state – seasonal cycle relationships proposed by either theory or analysis of observations seem to be reproduced by CGCMs. This is especially true for the amplitude of El Niño and is less clear for its frequency. Most of these relationships, first established for the pre-industrial control simulations, hold for the double and quadruple CO stabilized scenarios. The models that exhibit the largest El Niño amplitude change in these greenhouse gas increase scenarios are those that exhibit a mode change towards a T-mode (either from S-mode to hybrid or hybrid to T-mode). This follows the observed 1976 climate shift in the tropical Pacific, and supports the – still debated – finding of studies that associated this shift to increased greenhouse gases. In many respects, these models are also among those that best simulate the tropical Pacific climatology (ECHAM5/MPI-OM, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, MRI-CGM2.3.2, UKMO-HadCM3). Results from this large subset of models suggest the likelihood of increased El Niño amplitude in a warmer climate, though there is considerable spread of El Niño behavior among the models and the changes in the subsurface thermocline properties that may be important for El Niño change could not be assessed. There are no clear indications of an El Niño frequency change with increased greenhouse gases.

The spatial patterns of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from the coupled models are characterized by maximum variations displaced from the coast of South America, and generally extending too far west with respect to observations. Thermocline variability is characterized by dominant modes that are qualitatevely similar in all the models, and consistent with the \"recharge oscillator\" paradigm for ENSO. The meridional scale of the thermocline depth anomalies is generally narrower than observed, a result that can be related to the pattern of zonal wind stress perturbations in the central-western equatorial Pacific. The wind stress response to the eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies in the models is narrower and displaced further west than observed. The meridional scale of the wind stress can affect the amount of warm water involved in the recharge/discharge of the equatorial thermocline, while the longitudinal location of the wind stress anomalies can influence the advection of the mean zonal temperature gradient by the anomalous zonal currents, a process that may favor the growth and longer duration of ENSO events when the wind stress perturbations are displaced eastwards. Thus, both discrepancies of the wind stress anomaly patterns in the coupled models with respect to observations (narrow meridional extent, and westward displacement along the equator) may be responsible for the ENSO timescale being shorter in the models than in observations. The examination of the leading advective processes in the SST tendency equation indicates that vertical advection of temperature anomalies tends to favor ENSO growth in all the CGCMs, but at a smaller rate than in observations. In some models it can also promote a phase transition. Longer periods tend to be associated with thermocline and advective feedbacks that are in phase with the SST anomalies, while advective tendencies that lead the SST anomalies by a quarter cycle favor ENSO transitions, thus leading to a shorter period.

ENSO&#8217;s oceanic teleconnection into the IO, by coastal waves through the Indonesian archipelago, is poorly simulated in these models, with significant shifts in the turning latitude of radiating Rossby waves. In observations, ENSO forces, by the atmospheric bridge mechanism, strong ocean Rossby waves\r\nthat induce anomalies of SST, atmospheric convection and tropical cyclones in a thermocline dome over the southwestern tropical IO. While the southwestern IO thermocline dome is simulated in nearly all the models, this ocean Rossby wave response to ENSO is present only in a few of the models examined, suggesting difficulties in simulating ENSO&#8217;s teleconnection in surface wind. A majority of models display an equatorial zonal mode of the Bjerknes feedback with spatial\r\nstructures and seasonality similar to the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) in observations. This success appears due to their skills in simulating the mean state of the equatorial IO. Corroborating the role of the Bjerknes feedback in IOD, the thermocline depth, SST, precipitation and zonal wind are mutually positively correlated in these models, as in observations. The IOD-ENSO correlation during boreal fall ranges from -0.43 to 0.74 in the different models, suggesting that ENSO is one, but not the only, trigger for IOD.\r\n','in_press','J.

Mitchell','Evaluation of a component of the cloud response to climate change in an intercomparison of climate models','Most of the uncertainty in the climate sensitivity of contemporary general circulation models (GCMs) is believed to be connected with differences in the simulated radiative feedback from clouds. Traditional methods of evaluating clouds in GCMs compare time–mean geographical cloud fields or aspects of present-day cloud variability, with observational data. In both cases a hypothetical assumption is made that the quantity evaluated is relevant for the mean climate change response. Nine GCMs (atmosphere models coupled to mixed-layer ocean models) from the CFMIP and CMIP model comparison projects are used in this study to demonstrate a common relationship between the mean cloud response to climate change and present-day variability. Although atmosphere–mixed-layer ocean models are used here, the results are found to be equally applicable to transient coupled model simulations. When changes in cloud radiative forcing (CRF) are composited by changes in vertical velocity and saturated lower tropospheric stability, a component of the local mean climate change response can be related to present-day variability in all of the GCMs. This suggests that the relationship is not model specific and might be relevant in the real world. In this case, evaluation within the proposed compositing framework is a direct evaluation of a component of the cloud response to climate change. None of the models studied are found to be clearly superior or deficient when evaluated, but a couple appear to perform well on several relevant metrics. Whilst some broad similarities can be identified between the 60N–60S mean change in CRF to increased CO2 and that predicted from present-day variability, the two cannot be quantitatively constrained based on changes in vertical velocity and stability alone. Hence other processes also contribute to the global mean cloud response to climate change.','published','Clim.

In order to assess the uncertainties due to model formulation, 4 regional climate models (RCM’s) with 5 high resolution experiments, and 4 global models (GCM’s) are considered.\r\nFirstly, cyclone systems as synoptic scale processes in winter are investigated, as they are mainly relevant for the occurrence of extreme, damage causing wind speeds. This is achieved by use of an objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm, applied to the GCM’s. Secondly, changes in extreme near surface wind speeds are analysed. Based on percentile thresholds, the studied extreme wind speed indices allow a consistent analysis over Europe and take systematic deviations of the models into account. Relative changes in both intensity and frequency of extreme winds and their related uncertainties are assessed and related to changing patterns of extreme cyclones. Common feature of all investigated GCM’s is a reduced track density over Central Europe under climate change conditions if all systems are considered. If only extreme (i.e. the 5% strongest) cyclones are taken into account, an increasing cyclone activity for western parts of Central Europe is analysed, although the climate change signal reveals reduced spatial coherency as compared to all systems, partly revealing contrary results. With respect to extreme wind speeds, significant positive changes in intensity and frequency are obtained over at least 20% and 3% of the European domain under study (15°W-43°E; 35°-72°N), respectively. Location and extension of the affected areas (up to 60% and 50% of the domain for intensity and frequency, respectively), as well as the levels of changes (up to +15% and +200% for intensity and frequency, respectively) are shown to highly depend on the driving GCM, whereas differences between RCM’s when driven by the same GCM are relatively small.

We show that the upper tropospheric jet strength is a critical parameter in determining whether the planetary waves indicator exhibits a uni- or bimodal behavior, and we determine the relevant threshold value of the jet.

Discrepancies are found especially in the pre-satellite years of the records in the high frequency-high wavenumber propagating waves. This implies that in the pre-satellite period the two datasets have a different representation of the baroclinic available energy conversion processes. Minor differences are also found in the description of low frequency–low wavenumber standing waves. We observe a positive impact of the satellite data on the representation of wave activity over the oceanic sectors in the period starting from 1979, in particular on the description of high frequency variability. Since in the pre-satellite period the assimilated data are more scarce, predominately over the oceans, and of lower quality than found later on, they provide a weaker constraint to the model dynamics.

We then investigate to what extent these biases are due to the simulation of extratropical-tropical water mass exchanges in the coupled models. We demonstrate that the coupled models\' cold and fresh bias in the equatorial thermocline is due to the subduction of significantly fresher and colder water in the South Pacific. This freshening is due to too much precipitation in the South Pacific Convergence Zone. Lagrangian trajectories of water that flows to the equatorial thermocline are calculated to demonstrate that the anomalously large potential vorticity barriers in the coupled simulations in both the North and South Pacific prevent water in the lower thermocline from reaching the equator. The equatorial thermocline is shown to be primarily maintained by water that subducts in the subtropical South Pacific in both the coupled and uncoupled simulations. It is shown that the zonally integrated transport convergence at the equator in the subsurface branch of the climate mean STCs is well simulated in the uncoupled ocean model.

Zhang','Pacific Subtropical Cell variability in coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th Century','Observational studies of the Pacific basin since the 1950\'s have demonstrated that a decrease (increase) in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is significantly correlated with a spin-up (slow-down) of the Pacific Subtropical Cells (STCs). STCs are shallow wind-driven overturning circulations that provide a pathway by which extratropical atmospheric variability can impact the equatorial Pacific thermocline and, through upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, tropical Pacific SSTs. Recent studies have shown that this observed relationship between SSTs and STCs is absent in coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th centuries. In this paper we investigate what causes this relationship to breakdown and to what extent this limits the models\' ability to simulate observed climate change in the equatorial Pacific since the late 19th century. To provide insight into these questions we first show that the NCAR Community Climate System Model\'s simulation of observed climate change since the 1970\'s has a robust signal in the equatorial Pacific that bears a close resemblance to observations. Strikingly absent is a robust signal in the equatorial thermocline due to the underestimate of STC variability. Our results suggest that the coupled model may be reproducing the observed local ocean response to changes in forcing but inadequately reproducing the remote STC-forcing of the tropical Pacific due to the underestimate of extratropical winds that force these ocean circulations. These conclusions are found to be valid in 5 different coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th centuries (CCSM3, GISS EH, GFDL-CM2.1, CSIRO-Mk3, and HadCM3).','in_press','Ocean Modelling','2006','','','doi:10.1016/j.ocemod.2006.03.007','','2006-03-28 17:53:12','2007-03-20 08:12:02','amysolomon','ESGuser',1),(104,203,'Greene, A.M., L.

Part I: A dry radiative-transportive climate model','In this paper, we use a dry radiative-transportive climate model to illustrate that the atmospheric poleward heat transport plays an important role in amplifying the polar surface warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  Because of a much warmer surface in tropics, the anthropogenic radiative forcing is larger in tropics than in extratropics for same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.   A direct response to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an increase in the atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature contrast, leading to a strengthening of the atmospheric poleward heat transport.   As a result, part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the low-latitude atmosphere due to an increase in its opacity is transported to high latitudes.  This implies a “greenhouse-plus” (“greenhouse-minus”) feedback to the high (low) latitude surface temperatures, which acts to amplify (reduce) the initial surface warming in high (low) latitudes, causing a larger warming in high latitudes.  The Stefan-Boltzmann feedback suppresses the negative dynamical feedback in low latitudes more strongly than the positive in high latitudes, amplifying the global mean surface temperature warming.   \r\nBecause of the oceanic poleward heat transport, the ocean surface temperature in extratropics is warmer in winter compared to the land, implying a larger radiative forcing for the same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  The same dynamical feedback mechanism would also amplify the land surface warming in extratropics by transporting part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the atmosphere over the ocean surface to land.   This explains partly why the observed land surface warming in extratropics is stronger than the surrounding oceans in winter. \r\n','published','Climate Dynamics','2006','104','15','DOI 10.1007/s00382-005-0104-6','','2006-03-28 18:44:58','2006-03-28 19:04:53','mingcai','mingcai',1),(108,207,'Castet, Christelle','FOOTPRINT OF THE DYNAMICAL AMPLIFIER OF GLOBAL WARMING AND ATTRIBUTION OF MODELS’ UNCERTAINTIES','The largest warming over the last several decades has been observed in high latitudes. Cai (2005) proposed that part of the large amplitude climate warming in high latitudes could be explained by the “dynamical amplifier” feedback. This study will first provide observational and modeling evidences to validate the dynamical amplifier theory. The second part will address the question whether part of the differences in the CGCM’s global warming projections can be explained by the dynamical amplifier theory. The theory predicts an upward trend of the net radiation surplus (deficit) in low (high) latitudes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gazes. \r\n	The radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) using the ERA40 reanalysis and climate model simulations forced by anthropogenic radiative forcings made at 14 climate centers were analyzed.  The results indicate that both the radiation energy surplus in low latitudes and deficit in high latitudes at the TOA have been strengthened over the last several decades. Such an intensification of the radiation energy imbalance at the TOA is also confirmed by most of the climate model simulations.  Furthermore, the analysis of the net radiation budget between the surface and the TOA confirms that the change in the TOA energy imbalance is indeed due to the upward trend in the poleward heat transport, in accordance with the dynamical amplifier theory. \r\n	There is a large model-to-model variability of the intensification of the poleward heat transport among the 14 climate model simulations. It is found that about 59% of the global warming projection uncertainties, which varies from 1.5K to 4K, forced by the 2CO2 forcing can be explained by the variation of the intensification of the poleward heat transport among models.  The inter-model variability of the change in the poleward heat transport explains about 66% of the warming projection uncertainties for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and 54% for the Southern Hemisphere (SH).  The differences in the poleward heat transport intensification also explain about 71% and 49% of the warming uncertainties in the NH and SH high latitudes.  Therefore, it can be concluded that a large part of the uncertainties in the CGCM’s global warming projections can be explained by the dynamical amplifier theory.\r\n','published','M.S.

Crane','Consensus between GCM climate change projections with empirical downscaling: Precipitation downscaling over South Africa','This paper discusses issues that surround the development of empirical downscaling techniques as context for presenting a new approach based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The technique is applied to the downscaling of daily precipitation over South Africa. SOMs are used to characterize the state of the atmosphere on a localized domain surrounding each target location, based on NCEP 6-hourly reanalysis data from 1979-2002, and using surface and 700 hPa u and v wind vectors and specific and relative humidities, and surface temperature. Each unique atmospheric state is associated with an observed precipitation probability distribution function (PDF). Future climate states are derived from three GCMs: HadAM3, ECHAM4.5, CSIRO Mk2. In each case, the GCM data are mapped to the NCEP SOMs for each target location and a precipitation value is drawn at random from the associated precipitation PDF. The downscaling approach combines the advantages of a direct transfer function and a stochastic weather generator, and provides an indication of the strength of the regional versus stochastic forcing, as well as a measure of stationarity in the atmosphere-precipitation relationship.\r\n\r\nThe methodology is applied to South Africa. The downscaling reveals a similarity in the projected climate change between the models. Each GCM is projecting similar changes in atmospheric state and they converge on a downscaled solution that points to increased summer rainfall in the interior and eastern part of the country, and a decrease in winter rainfall in the Western Cape. The actual GCM precipitation projections from the three models show large areas of inter-model disagreement, suggesting that the model differences may be due to their precipitation parameterization schemes, rather than to basic disagreements in their projections of the changing atmospheric state over South Africa.','in_press','International Journal of Climatology','2006','','','','','2006-03-28 20:07:24','2006-03-28 20:07:24','hewitson','hewitson',1),(110,59,'Zhou, Tian-Jun and Rucong Yu','Twentieth Century Surface Air Temperature over China and the Globe Simulated by Coupled Climate Models','This paper examines variations of the surface air temperature (SAT) over China and the globe in the twentieth-century simulated by nineteen coupled climate models driven by historical natural and anthropogenic forcings. Most models perform well in simulating both the global and the Northern Hemispheric mean SAT evolutions of the twentieth-century. The inclusion of natural forcings improves the simulation, in particular for the first half of the century. The reproducibility of the SAT averaged over China is lower than that of the global and hemispheric averages, but it is still acceptable. The contribution of natural forcings to the SAT over China in the first half of the century is not as robust as that to the global and hemispheric averages. No model could successfully produce the reconstructed warming over China in the 1920s. The prescribed natural and anthropogenic forcings in the coupled climate models mainly produce the warming trends and the decadal to interdecadal scale SAT variations with poor performances at shorter timescales. The prominent warming trend in the last half of the century over China and its acceleration in recent decades are weakly simulated. There are discrepancies between the simulated and observed regional features of the SAT trend over China. Few models could produce the summertime cooling over the middle part of eastern China (27º-36ºN), while two models acceptably produce the meridional gradients of the wintertime warming trends, with North China experiencing larger warming.

Recent climate scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are here analysed to explore the geographical origin of, and the possible reasons for, uncertainties in the hydrological model response to global warming. Using the 20th century simulations and the SRES-A2 scenarios from eight different coupled ocean-atmosphere models, it is shown that the main uncertainties originate from the tropics, where even the sign of the zonal mean precipitation change remains uncertain over land. Given the large interannual fluctuations of tropical precipitation, it is then suggested that the ENSO variability can be used as a surrogate of climate change to better constrain the model reponse. While the simulated sensitivity of global land precipitation to global mean surface temperature indeed shows a remarkable similarity between the interannual and climate change timescales respectively, the model ability to capture the ENSO-precipitation relationship is not a major constraint on the global hydrological projections. Only the model that exhibits the highest precipitation sensitivity clearly appears as an outlier. Besides deficiencies in the simulation of the ENSO-tropical rainfall teleconnections, the study indicates that uncertainties in the 21st century evolution of these teleconnections represent an important contribution to the model spread, thus emphasizing the need for improving the simulation of the tropical Pacific variability to provide more reliable scenarios of the global hydrological cycle. It also suggests that validating the mean present-day climate is not sufficient to assess the reliability of climate projections, and that interannual variability is another suitable and possibly more useful candidate for constraining the model response. Finally, it is shown that uncertainties in precipitation change are, like precipitation itself, very unevenly distributed over the globe, the most vulnerable countries sometimes being those where the anticipated precipitation changes are the most uncertain.\r\n','published','Climate Dyn.','2006','26','367-385','doi:10.1007/s00382-005-0088-2','','2006-03-28 23:24:41','2006-03-28 23:24:41','douvil','douvil',1),(112,181,'Nieto S. and C.

This inter-comparison is based on the modes obtained by the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and spectral analyses to investigate the temporal properties of the most significant spatial patterns. The models reproduce well the observed seasonal cycle and the mean winter pattern; however, they poorly capture the interannual variability found in observed data. To ascertain the reasons for these results, features affecting the precipitation process are considered by analyzing the relationships with the dominant modes of large-scale atmospheric fields, such as sea level pressure, storm activity, jet stream, moisture flux, and teleconnection indices.

We developed a statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics to evaluate the models’ skills in simulating late 20th century temperature over continental areas. Some criteria (Model Weight Indices) are computed allowing comparing over such large regions how each model captures the temperature large scale structures and contributes to the multi-model combination. As the study demonstrates, the use of neural networks, optimized by Bayesian statistics, leads to two major results. First, the Model Weights Indices can be interpreted as optimal weights for a linear combination of the climate models. Second, the comparison between the neural network projection of 21st century conditions and a linear combination of such conditions allows the identification of the regions, which will most probably change, according to model biases and model ensemble variance. Model simulations in the southern tip of South America and along the Chilean and Peruvian coasts or in the northern coasts of South America (Venezuela, Guiana) are particularly poor. Overall, our results present an upper bound of potential temperature warming for each scenario. Spatially, in SRES A2, our major findings are that Tropical South America could warm up by about 4°C, while southern South America would also undergo  a near 2-3°C  average warming. Interestingly, this annual mean temperature trend is modulated by the seasonal cycle in a contrasted way according to the regions. In southern South America, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle tends to increase, while in northern South America, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle would be reduced leading to much milder winters. We show that all the scenarios have similar patterns and only differ in amplitude. SRES A1B differ from SRES A2 mainly for  the late 21st century, reaching more or less an 80%-90% amplitude compared  to SRES A2. SRES B1, however, diverges from the other scenarios as soon as 2025.

We developed a statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics to compute a transfer function between models and observations. Such a transfer function was then used to project future conditions and to derive what we would call the optimal model combination for 21st century climate change projections. To evaluate the results, various criteria were computed making it possible to evaluate the models’ skills in simulating late 20th century precipitation over continental areas as well as their divergence in projecting climate change conditions. Despite the relatively poor skill of most of the climate models in simulating present-day large scale precipitation patterns, we identified two types of models: the climate models with moderate-to-normal (i.e. close to observations) precipitation amplitudes over the Amazonian basin; and the climate models with a low precipitation in that region and too high a precipitation on the equatorial Pacific coast. Under SRES A2 greenhouse gas forcing, the neural network simulates an increase in precipitation over the La Plata basin coherent the mean model ensemble projection. Over the Amazonian basin, a decrease in precipitation is projected. However, the models strongly diverge, and the neural network was found to give more weight to models, which better simulate present-day climate conditions. In the southern tip of the continent, the models poorly simulate present-day climate. However, they display a fairly good convergence when simulating climate change response with a weak increase south of 45°S and a decrease in Chile between 30°S and 45°S. Other scenarios (A1B and B1) strongly resemble the SRES A2 trends but with weaker amplitudes.

This work is focused on trends of precipitation and clouds over tropical ocean and land.\r\nWe find that the CGCMs are reasonably consistent in depicting aspects of long term changes in the twentieth century climate and the tropical hydrological cycle, including 1) a relatively good simulation of trends in surface warming over both the tropical ocean and land, in agreement with observations; 2) increasing precipitation over the tropical ocean and decreasing precipitation over tropical land; 3) an increasing trend in heavy and light rain, but a decreasing trend in moderate rain, over the tropical ocean; and 4) a reduction in total cloud cover in the tropics. These successful simulations are encouraging and enhance our confidence in the future climate projections provided by these models. On the other hand, the current generation of CGCMs still has a number of deficiencies, particularly in modeling clouds and their interactions with radiation. Although most CGCMs are able to simulate the correct sign of trends in precipitation and clouds, they significantly underestimate the magnitudes of the observations. These underestimations likely cause gross errors in model simulations of the global water and energy balance. A better understanding of physical processes and an improvement in the CGCM representations of physical processes associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation are needed.

We find that only eight CGCMs (hit-models) produce a reasonable Sahel drought signal, and seven CGCMs (miss-models) produce excessive rainfall over Sahel during the observed drought period.  Even the model with the highest prediction skill of the Sahel drought could only predict the increasing trend of severe drought events but not the beginning and duration of the events.     From analyses of the statistical characteristics of the hit- and miss- models,  we conclude that a good simulation of the Sahel drought requires a) a strong coupling between Sahel rainfall and Indian Ocean SST, with warm (cold) SST identified with Sahel drought (flood),  b) a significant coupling  between Sahel rainfall and  the Atlantic Ocean SST, with a warm equatorial Atlantic and cold extratropical North Atlantic coexisting with Sahel drought, and vice versa, and c) a robust land-surface feedback with strong sensitivity of precipitation and land evaporation to soil moisture.   These three characteristics constitute a sufficient condition for a good simulation of Sahel drought in CGCMs.  ','published','Journal of Geophysical Research','2006','111, D0711','','doi:10.1029/2005JD006281','','2006-03-29 07:40:59','2006-05-26 08:58:20','hwang732002','ESGuser',1),(120,32,'Ruiz-Barradas, A., and S.

For each of the models, an oceanic state corresponding to the A1B stabilization experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm) is compared to a state corresponding to the pre-industrial control experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of\r\n280 ppm). In all of the models, the first baroclinic Rossby radius increases with increasing oceanic stratification in the warmer climate. There is, however, a considerable range among the models in the magnitude of the increase. At the latitudes of intense eddy activity associated with instability of western boundary currents (around 35-40 deg), the increase reaches 4 km on average, or about 15% of the local baroclinic Rossby radius. Some of the models predict an increase of the baroclinic Rossby radius by \r\nmore than 20% at these latitudes under the applied forcing. It is therefore suggested that in a plausible future warmer climate, the characteristic length scale of mesoscale eddies, as well as boundary currents and fronts, may increase. In addition, since the speed of long baroclinic Rossby waves is proportional to the squared baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, the results suggest that the time scale for large-scale dynamical oceanic adjustment may decrease in the warmer climate, thereby increasing the frequency of long-term climate variability where the oceanic Rossby wave dynamics set the dominant period. Finally, the speed of equatorial Kelvin waves and Rossby waves, carrying signals along the Equator, including those related to ENSO, is projected to increase. ','published','J.

A large number of model simulations realistically captured the climatological annual mean, seasonal cycle and temporal trends of sea ice area over the Northern Hemisphere during 1979-99, although there is considerable scatter among the models. In particular, multi-model ensemble means show promising estimates very close to observations for the late 20th century. Model projections for the 21st century demonstrate the largest sea ice area decreases generally in the SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A1B and A2 scenarios compared with the B1 scenario, indicating large multi-model ensemble mean reductions of -3.54 1.66X105 km2/decade in A1B, -4.08 1.33X105km2/decade in A2, and -2.22 1.11X105km2/decade in B1. The corresponding percentage reductions are 31.1%, 33.4%, and 21.6% in the last 20 years of the 21st century, relative to 1979-99. Further, multiyear ice coverage decreases rapidly at rates of -3.86 2.07X105km2/decade in A1B, -4.94 1.91X105km2/decade in A2 and -2.67 1.7107X105km2/decade in B1, making major contributions to the total ice reductions. In contrast, seasonal (first-year) ice area increases by 1.10 2.46X105km2/decade, 1.99 1.47X105 km2/decade and 1.05 1.9247 X105 km2/decade in the same scenarios, leading to decreases of 59.7% and 65.0% of the multiyear ice area and increases of 14.1% and 27.8% of the seasonal ice area in the last 20 years of this century.  Statistical analysis shows that many of the models are consistent in the sea ice change projections among all scenarios. The results include an evaluation of the 99% confidence interval of the model-derived change of sea ice coverage, giving a quantification of uncertainties in estimating sea ice changes based on the participating models. Hence the seasonal cycle of sea ice area is amplified and an increased large portion of seasonally ice-covered Arctic Ocean is expected at the end of the 21st century. The very different changes of multiyear and seasonal ice may have significant implications for the polar energy and hydrological budgets and pathways.','published','J.

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab-ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios.

Changes in different cloud types show much greater consistency between the two experiments for any individual model and amongst the set of models analyzed here.

In particular, it applies a new methodology that permits the inclusion of many more general circulation models (GCMs) into the analysis, and it also includes more recent observations. This methodology involves fitting a series of energy balance models (EBMs) to the GCM output in order to estimate the temporal response patterns to the various forcings.\r\n\r\nDespite considerable spread in estimated EBM parameters, characteristics of model performance, such as the transient climate response, appear to be more constrained for each of the forcings. The resulting estimated response patterns are provided as input to the standard fingerprinting method used in previous studies. The estimated GCM responses to changes in greenhouse gases are detected in the observed record for all of the GCMs, and are generally found to be consistent with the observed changes; the same is generally true for the responses to changes in stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions. GCM responses to changes in tropospheric sulfate aerosols and solar irradiance also appear consistent with the observed record, although the uncertainty is larger. Greenhouse gas and solar irradiance changes are found to have contributed to a best guess of &#8764;0.8 and &#8764;0.3 K warming over the 1901–2005 period, respectively, while sulfate aerosols have contributed a &#8764;0.4 K cooling. This analysis provides an observationally constrained estimate of future warming, which is found to be fairly robust across GCMs. By 2100, a warming of between about 1.5 and 4.5 K can be expected according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B emissions scenario.\r\n\r\nThese results indicate an emerging constraint for global mean surface temperature responses to external forcings across GCMs, which is corroborated in the observed record. This implies that observationally constrained estimates of past warming and predictions of future warming are indeed becoming robust.','published','Journal of Climate','2007','20','517-530','','http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/stoned/papers/StoneDA_AllenMR_StottPA_2007.pdf','2006-03-30 02:51:02','2007-02-27 03:35:02','stoned','stoned',1),(128,28,'Stone, D.

Unfortunately, the traditional method for detecting and attributing changes due to multiple forcings requires large numbers of general circulation model (GCM) simulations incorporating different initial conditions and forcing scenarios and these have only been performed with a small number of GCMs.  This paper presents an extension to the fingerprinting technique which permits the inclusion of GCMs in the multi-signal analysis of surface temperature even when the required families of ensembles have not been generated.  This is achieved by fitting a series of energy balance models (EBMs) to the GCM output in order to estimate the temporal response patterns to the various forcings.\r\n\r\nThis methodology is applied to the very large Challenge ensemble of 62 simulations of historical climate conducted with the NCAR CCSM 1.4 GCM, as well as some simulations from other GCMs.  Considerable uncertainty exists in the estimates of the parameters in fitted EBMs.  Nevertheless, temporal response patterns from these EBMs are more reliable and the combined EBM time series closely mimics the GCM in the context of transient forcing.  In particular, detection and attribution results from this technique appear self-consistent and consistent with results from other methods provided that all major forcings are included in the analysis.\r\n\r\nUsing this technique on the Challenge ensemble, the estimated responses to changes in greenhouse gases, tropospheric sulphate aerosols, and stratospheric volcanic aerosols are all detected in the observed record, but only the response to the tropospheric sulphate aerosols is consistent with the observed record without a scaling of the amplitude.  The estimated GCM response to SOL forcing is inconsistent with the observations.  The result is that the temperature difference of the 1995-2004 decade relative to the 1940-1949 decade can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, with a partially offsetting cooling from sulphate emissions and little contribution from natural sources.\r\n \r\nThe results support the viability of the new methodology as an extension to current analysis tools for the detection and attribution of climate change which will allow the inclusion of many more GCMs.  Shortcomings remain, however, and so it should not be considered a replacement to traditional techniques.','published','Journal of Climate','2007','20','504–516','','http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/stoned/papers/StoneDA_AllenMR_etalii_2007.pdf','2006-03-30 02:53:46','2007-02-27 03:37:03','stoned','stoned',1),(129,28,'Alley, R., et alii','Summary for Policymakers','The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report describes progress in understanding of the human and natural drivers of climate change1, observed climate change, climate processes and attribution, and estimates of projected future climate change.

The sensitivity of the equilibrium line altitude to air temperature is found to be 125 m/K, or 160 m/K if concurrent long-wave radiation change is taken into account. Long-term simulations over 1800-2165 are carried out using IPCC AR4 GCM output. St Sorlin glacier is likely to vanish before 2100.','published','PhD Thesis, University of Grenoble I, France','2005','','1-132','','http://lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/publiscience/theses/these-gerbaux.pdf','2006-03-30 06:55:29','2006-03-30 06:55:29','christo','christo',1),(136,415,'Cayan, Dan, Ed Maurer, Mike Dettinger, Mary Tyree, Katharine Hayhoe, Celine Bonfils, Phil Duffy, and Ben Santer','Climate Scenarios for California','Possible future climate changes in California are investigated from a varied set of climate change model simulations. These simulations, conducted by three state-of-the-art global climate models, provide trajectories from three greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. These scenarios and the resulting climate simulations are not \"predictions,\" but rather are a limited sample from among the many plausible pathways that may affect California\'s climate. Future GHG concentrations are uncertain because they depend on future social, political, and technological pathways, and thus the IPCC has produced four \"families\" of emission scenarios. To explore some of these uncertainties, emissions scenarios A2 (a medium-high emissions) and B1 (low emissions) were selected from the current IPCC Fourth climate assessment, wich provides several recent model simulations driven by A2 and B1 emissions. The global climate model simulations addressed here were from PCM1, the Parallel Climate Model from the Natinoal Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) group, and CM2.1 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Fluids Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). \r\n\r\nAs part of the scenarios assessment, a statistical technique using properties of historical weather data was employed to correct model biases and \"downscale\" the global-model simulation of future climates to a finer level of detail, onto a grid of approximately 7 miles (12 kilometers), which is more suitable for impact studies at the scales needed by California decision makers. \r\n\r\nIn current climate-change simulations, temperatures over California warm significantly during the twenty-first century, with the temperature increases from approximately +3 deg F (1.5 deg C) in the lower emissions scenario (B1) withing the less responsive model (PCM1) to +8 deg F (4.5 deg C) in the higher emissions scenario (A2) within the more responsive model (CM2.1). Three of the simulations (all except the low-emission scenario run of the low-response model) exhibit more warming in summer than in winter. \r\n\r\nIn all of the simulations, most precipitation continues to occur in winter, with virtually all derived from North Pacific winter storms. Relatively little change in overall precipitation is projected. Climate warming has a profound influence in diminishing snow accumulations, because there is more rain and less snow, and earlier snowmelt. These snow losses increase as the warming increases, so that they are most severe under climate changes projected by the more sensitive model with the higher GHG emissions. \r\n','published','California Climate Change Center, publication #CEC-500-2005-203-SF','2006','','52 pages','','http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/climate_action_team/reports/index.html','2006-03-30 10:10:43','2006-03-30 10:10:43','mtyree','mtyree',1),(137,415,'Cayan, D., P. Bromirski, K. Hayhoe, M. Tyree, M. Dettinger and R. Flick','Projecting Future Sea Level','California\'s coastal observations and global model projections indicate that California\'s open coast and estuaries will experience increasing sea levels over the next century. Sea level rise has affected much of the coast of California, including the Southern California coast, the Central California open coast, and the San Francisco Bay and upper estuary. These trends, quantified from a small set of California tide gages, have ranged from 10-20 centimeters (cm) {3.9-7.9 inces} per century, quite similar to that estimated for global mean sea level. So far, there is little evidence that the rate of rise has accelerated, and the rate of rise at California tide gages has actually flattened since 1980, but projections suggest substantial sea level rise may occur over the next century. \r\n\r\nClimate change simulations project a substantial rate of global sea level rise over the next century due to thermal expansion as the oceans warm and runoff from melting land-based snow and ice accelerates. Sea level rise projected from the models increases with the amount of warming. Relative to sea levels in 2000, by the 2070-2099 period, sea level rise projections range from 11-54 cm {4.3-21 in} for simulations following the lower (B1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenario, from 14-61 cm {5.5-24 in} for the middle-upper (A2) emission scenario, and from 17-72 cm {6.7-28 in} for the highest (A1fi) scenario. In addition to relatively steady secular trends, sea levels along the California coast undergo shorter period variability over or below predicted tide levels and changes associated with long-term trends. These variations are caused by weather events and by seasonal to decadal climate fluctuations over the Pacific Ocean that in turn affect the Pacific coast. Highest coastal sea levels have occurred when winter storms and Pacific climate disturbances, such as El Nino, have coincided with high astronomical tides. \r\n\r\nThis study considers a range of projected future global sea level rises in examining possible impacts at California coastal and estuarine stations. Two climate models and three scenarios considered in this scenarios study provide a set of possible future weather and short-period climate fluctuations, and a range of potential long-term sea level rise values. A range of mean sea level rise was considered in combination with weather and El Nino fluctuations extracted from two global climate models and two GHG emissions scenarios. The mean sea level rise values, determined from a survey of several climate models, range from approximately 10-80 cm {3.9-31 in} between 2000 and 2100. The middle to higher end of this range would substantially exceed the historical rate of sea level rise of 15-20 cm {5.9-7.9 in} per century observed at San Francisco and San Diego during the last 100 years. Gradual sea level rise progressively worsens the impacts of high tides and the surge and waves associated with storms. The potential for impacts of future sea level rise was assessed from the occurrence of hourly sea level extremes. The occurrence of extreme events follows a sharply escalating pattern as the magnitude of future sea level rise increases. The confluence of low barometric pressures from storms and the presence large waves at the same time substantially increases the likelihood of high, damaging sea levels along the California coast. Similarly, astronomical tides and disturbances in sea level that are caused by weather and climate fluctuations are transmitted into the San Francisco Bay and Delta, and on into the lower reaches of the Sacramento River. In addition to elevating Bay and Delta sea levels directly through inverse barometer and wind effects, storms may generate heavy precipitation and high fresh water runoff and cause floods in the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, increasing the potential for inundation of levees and other structures. There may also be increased risk of levee failure due to the hydraulics and geometry of these structures. Rising sea levels from climate change will increase the frequency and duration of extremem high water levels, causing historical coastal and San Francisco Bay/Delta structure design criteria to be exceeded. \r\n','published','California Climate Change Center, publication #CEC-500-2005-202-SF','2006','','64 pages','','http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-500-2005-202/CEC-500-2005-202-SF.PDF','2006-03-30 10:45:44','2006-03-30 10:49:37','mtyree','mtyree',1),(138,415,'Cayan, D., A.

This study considered three future GHG emissions scenarios - low, medium high, and high emissions - and explored associated climate changes through three modern climate models of differing sensitivity to GHG concentrations. \r\n\r\n - Although climate model results are inconclusive as to whether California\'s precipitation will change over the next century, all climate models show increases in temperature, with the aggregate of several model runs containing a range of warming from 2000 to 2100 from about +2 deg C to about +6 deg C (+3.6 deg F to about +10.8 deg F). Increases in temperature alone would impact the California hydrological cycle, with consequences upon the state\'s water supply, hydroelectric power supply, agriculture, recreation, and ecosystems. \r\n\r\n - Climate change could produce compounding impacts - for instance, in the San Francisco Bay Delta, heightened sea levels and high river inflows from warmer storms would place levee systems in greater jeopardy of flooding. \r\n\r\n - Some of the most dramatic climate change impacts will be experienced as increased freqeuncy and severity of extreme events, such as heat waves, wildfires, flooding, and conditions conducive to air pollution formation. \r\n\r\n - Even under lower GHG emissions scenarios, some impacts of climate change are inevitable. As a result, although adaptation is not the solution to climate change, it is a necessary complementary stategy to manage some of the projected impacts. \r\n\r\n - Although there are many opportunities for California to increase its capacity to cope with many climate change impacts, these can be costly, and they require time and planning. \r\n\r\n - More analysis - and in some cases, more information - is needed to better understand the vulnerability of California\'s health, economy, and environment to climate change. In particular, greater attention must focus on social dimensions of climate change for both assessing and implementing the state\'s mitigative and adaptive potential. Critical to this work will be evaluating and addressing the distributional and equity implications of climate changes in California. \r\n','published','California Climate Change Center, publication #CEC-500-2005-186-SF','2006','','53 pages','','http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-500-2005-186/CEC-500-2005-186-SF.PDF','2006-03-30 11:16:00','2006-03-30 11:16:00','mtyree','mtyree',1),(139,31,'Wang, G.L.','Agricultural drought in a future climate: results from 15 GCMs participating in the IPCC AR4','This study examines the impact of greenhouse gas warming on soil moisture based on predictions of fifteen global climate models by comparing the after-stabilization climate in the SRESA1b experiment with the pre-industrial control climate. The models are consistent in predicting summer dryness and winter wetness in only part of the northern middle and high latitudes. Slightly over half of the models predict year-round wetness in central Eurasia and/or year-round dryness in Siberia and mid-latitude Northeast Asia. One explanation is offered that relates such lack of seasonality to the carry-over effect of soil moisture storage from season to season. In the tropics and subtropics, a decrease of soil moisture is the dominant response. The models are especially consistent in predicting drier soil over the US Southwest, the Mediterranean, Australia, and the South Africa in all seasons, and over much of the Amazon and West Africa in the JJA season and the Asian monsoon region in the DJF season. Since the only major areas of future wetness predicted with a high level of model consistency are part of the northern middle and high latitudes during the non-growing season, it is suggested that greenhouse gas warming will cause a worldwide agricultural drought. Over regions where there are considerable consistency among the analyzed models in predicting the sign of soil moisture changes, there is a wide range of magnitudes of the soil moisture response, indicating a high degree of model dependency in terrestrial hydrological sensitivity. A major part of the inter-model differences in the sensitivity of soil moisture response are attributable to differences in land surface parameterization.','published','Climate Dynamics','2005','25','739-753','10.1007/s00382-005-0057-9','','2006-03-30 12:29:20','2006-03-30 12:29:20','gwang','gwang',1),(140,415,'Dettinger, M.','Consensus and scatter among climate-change projections for California','During the past year, large numbers of global climate-change simulations have become available, in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4).

Here we use the multi-thousand member ensemble of climate model simulations from the climateprediction.net project and a neural network to establish a relation between climate sensitivity and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in regional temperature. Most models with high sensitivities are found to overestimate the seasonal cycle compared to observations. A probability density function for climate sensitivity is then calculated from the present day seasonal cycle in reanalysis and instrumental datasets. Subject to a number of assumptions on the models and datasets used, we find that climate sensitivity is very unlikely (5% probability) to be either below  1.5 to 2 K or above about 5 to 6.5 K, with the best agreement found for sensitivities between 3 and 3.5 K.  This range is narrower than most probabilistic estimates derived from the observed 20th century warming.

The increase in stability is especially evident in the summer season, and is more prominent in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern.  The moist static stability is largely unchanged, on the other hand, showing that moist convection plays a dominant role in determining the temperature structure of the midlatitudes.

Regarding to the effects, IPCC (2001) has shown many proofs about the raising of global temperature and the changing of other climate parameters such as rainfall, humidity, etc. Generally, it gives specific influence to the distribution of rainfall patterns regionally or even locally. The study based on general idea to learn the relationship of the increasing of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere to the changing of rainfall patterns in Indonesia on regional and local point of views. \r\n	In the first part of our research, we were focusing our study in developing regionalization techniques. We have developed and practiced some of statistical downscaling methods and select the best method that statistically produces the best result on reconstructing Indonesian rainfall. The selected method also will be use to estimate the future rainfall based on GCMs scenario data as well as the historical rainfall. The study compared three statistical downscaling methods; they are Principal Component Regression (PCR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These methods were formulated using historical precipitable water (prw) data from different GCM models (CSIRO-Mk3.0, CGCM3.1, ECHAM5 and GFDL-CM2.0) which used to downscale the observation rainfall data in Aceh, Padang, Solok, Lampung, Jakarta, Kupang, Pontianak, and Ambon. We suggest that MARS method has given better performance rather than PCR and ANN methods. The study also found that the reducing of GCMs gridded data using principal component analysis for the six data of observed areas produces >80% of total variants for the first five or six components. The study of historical rainfall shown that in a century DJF rainfall pattern in Padang changed gradually as well as in Aceh on JJA and SON patterns, and in Jakarta on DJF pattern. \r\n','in_preparation','','','','','','','2006-04-10 19:30:32','2006-04-17 17:16:56','akhmadfaqih','akhmadfaqih',1),(142,411,'Church, J.A., N.J.

However, observed decadal variability in ocean heat content and sea level has not been reproduced well in climate models. Aerosols injected into the stratosphere during volcanic eruptions scatter incoming solar radiation, and cause a rapid cooling of the atmosphere and a reduction in rainfall, as well as other changes in the climate system. Here we use observations of ocean heat content and a set of climate simulations to show that large volcanic eruptions result in rapid reductions in ocean heat content and global mean sea level. For the Mt Pinatubo eruption, we estimate a reduction in ocean heat content of about 3 x 10^22 J and a global sea-level fall of about 5 mm. Over the three years following such an eruption, we estimate a decrease in evaporation of up to 0.1 mm d^-1, comparable to observed changes in mean land precipitation. The recovery of sea level following the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 explains about half of the difference between the long-term rate of sea-level rise of 1.8 mm yr^-1 (for 1950–2000), and the higher rate estimated for the more recent period where satellite altimeter data are available (1993–2000).

The seasonal behavior of the SAH is presented for each model. Analyses of the results show that all models are able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of the SAH. Locations of the SAH center are also basically reproduced by these models. All models underestimate the intensity and the extension of coverage in summer. The anomalous SAH can be divided into east and west modes according to its longitudinal position in summer on the interannual timescale, and the composite anomalies of the observed precipitation for these two modes tend to have opposite signs over East Asia. However, only several coupled GCMs can simulate the relationship between rainfall and SAH similar to the observed one, which may be associated with the bias in simulation of the subtropical anticyclone over the West Pacific (SAWP) at 500 hPa. In fact, it is found that any coupled GCM, that can reproduce the reasonable summer mean state of SAWP and the southward (northward) withdrawal (extension) for the east (west) mode of SAH as compared to the observed, will also simulate similar rainfall anomaly patterns for the east and west SAH modes over East Asia. Further analysis indicates that the observed variations in the SAH, SAWP and rainfall are closely related to the sea surface temperature (SST) over the equatorial tropical Pacific. Particularly, some models cannot simulate the SAWP extending northward in the west mode and withdrawing southward in the east mode, which may be related to weak major El  Nino or La  events. The abilities of the coupled GCMs to simulate the SAWP and ENSO events are associated partly with their ability to reproduce the observed relationship between SAH and the rainfall anomaly over East Asia.','published','Adv.Atmos.Sci','2006','23(3)','375-390','','','2006-03-30 17:17:41','2007-02-27 16:37:44','zhouningfang','zhouningfang',1),(144,237,'Sun, S., and R.

The technique is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of local climate changes is only a function of the all-model mean global average warming. Although this is unlikely to be exactly true, cross-verification indicates that the resulting biases are more than compensated by the increased sample size provided by the method. The resulting forecasts for southern Finland suggest a 95% probability of annual mean warming and an 80% probability of increased annual mean precipitation from the years 1971-2000 to 2011-2020 under the SRES A1B emissions scenario. The choice of the emissions scenario is unimportant for such short-term forecasts but becomes gradually more important towards the late 21st century.  The simulations also suggest that the probability of near-term warming that is large enough to be discernible from internal variability is largest in the tropics where internal temperature variability is small, not in the Arctic where the average model-simulated warming is largest.

In this paper we\r\nevaluate the volcanic responses in simulations produced by seven of the climate models\r\nincluded in the model intercomparison conducted as part of the preparation of the\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).\r\nWe consider global effects as well as the regional circulation effects in the extratropical\r\nNorthern Hemisphere focusing on the AO responses forced by volcanic eruptions.\r\nSpecifically we analyze results from the IPCC historical runs that simulate the evolution of\r\nthe circulation over the last part of the 19th century and the entire 20th century using a\r\nrealistic time series of atmospheric composition (greenhouse gases and aerosols). In\r\nparticular, composite anomalies over the two boreal winters following each of the nine\r\nlargest low-latitude eruptions during the period 1860–1999 are computed for various\r\ntropospheric and stratospheric fields. These are compared when possible with\r\nobservational data. The seven IPCC models we analyzed use similar assumptions about\r\nthe amount of volcanic aerosols formed in the lower stratosphere following the volcanic\r\neruptions that have occurred since 1860. All models produce tropospheric cooling and\r\nstratospheric warming as in observations. However, they display a considerable range of\r\ndynamic responses to volcanic aerosols. Nevertheless, some general conclusions can be\r\ndrawn. The IPCC models tend to simulate a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in\r\nresponse to volcanic forcing similar to that typically observed. However, the associated\r\ndynamic perturbations and winter surface warming over Northern Europe and Asia in the\r\npost-volcano winters is much weaker in the models than in observations. The AR4\r\nmodels also underestimate the variability and long-term trend of the AO. This deficiency\r\naffects high-latitude model predictions and may have a similar origin. This analysis allows\r\nus to better evaluate volcanic impacts in up-to-date climate models and to better\r\nquantify the model Arctic Oscillation sensitivity to external forcing. This potentially could\r\nlead to improving model climate predictions in the extratropical latitudes of the Northern\r\nHemisphere.','published','J. Geophys.

Modeling advances now provide the opportunity of utilizing global general circulation models (GCMs) for projections of extreme temperature and precipitation indicators. We analyze historical and future simulations of ten such indicators as derived from an ensemble of 8 GCMs contributing to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4), under a range of emissions scenarios. Our focus is on the consensus from the GCM ensemble, in terms of direction and significance of the changes, at the global average and geographical scale. The climate extremes described by the ten indices range from heat-wave frequency to frost-day occurrence, from dry-spell length to heavy rainfall amounts. Historical trends generally agree with previous observational studies, providing a basic sense of reliability for the GCM simulations. Projections for the 21st century are unanimous in confirming the changes in most temperature indices that are expected within a warmer climate, with differences in the spatial distribution of the changes and in the rates of the trends detected across scenarios. Depiction of a wetter world emerges unequivocally in the global averages of most of the precipitation indices. However, consensus and significance are less strong when regional patterns are concerned. This analysis provides a first overview of projected changes in climate extremes from the IPCC-AR4 model ensemble, and has significant implications with regard to climate projections for impact assessments.

M. de F. and K. E. Taylor',' Climate forcings and climate sensitivities diagnosed from coupled climate model integrations','A simple technique is proposed for calculating global mean climate forcing from transient integrations of coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). This “climate forcing” differs from the conventionally defined radiative forcing as it includes semidirect effects that account for certain short time scale responses in the troposphere. First, a climate feedback term is calculated from reported values of 2 × CO2 radiative forcing and surface temperature time series from 70-yr simulations by 20 AOGCMs. In these simulations carbon dioxide is increased by 1% yr&#8722;1. The derived climate feedback agrees well with values that are diagnosed from equilibrium climate change experiments of slab-ocean versions of the same models. These climate feedback terms are associated with the fast, quasi-linear response of lapse rate, clouds, water vapor, and albedo to global surface temperature changes. The importance of the feedbacks is gauged by their impact on the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. Partial compensation is found between longwave and shortwave feedback terms that lessens the intermodel differences in the equilibrium climate sensitivity. There is also some indication that the AOGCMs overestimate the strength of the positive longwave feedback.\r\n\r\nThese feedback terms are then used to infer the shortwave and longwave time series of climate forcing in twentieth- and twenty-first-century simulations in the AOGCMs. The technique is validated using conventionally calculated forcing time series from four AOGCMs. In these AOGCMs the shortwave and longwave climate forcings that are diagnosed agree with the conventional forcing time series within &#8764;10%. The shortwave forcing time series exhibit order of magnitude variations between the AOGCMs, differences likely related to how both natural forcings and/or anthropogenic aerosol effects are included. There are also factor of 2 differences in the longwave climate forcing time series, which may indicate problems with the modeling of well-mixed greenhouse gas changes. The simple diagnoses presented provides an important and useful first step for understanding differences in AOGCM integrations, indicating that some of the differences in model projections can be attributed to different prescribed climate forcing, even for so-called standard climate change scenarios.\r\n','published','J.

Hall','Assessing snow albedo feedback in simulated climate change','We isolate and quantify the two factors controlling Northern Hemisphere springtime snow albedo feedback in transient climate change based on scenario runs of 17 climate models used in the IPCC 4th Assessment.  The first factor is the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo, representing the atmosphere\'s attenuation effect on surface albedo anomalies.  It is potentially a major source of divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback because of large differences in simulated cloud fields in Northern Hemisphere land areas.  To calculate it, we develop an analytical model governing planetary albedo.  We show detailed validation of the analytical model for two of the simulations, CCSM3.0 and CM2.0, demonstrating that it facilitates highly accurate calculation of the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo given readily-available simulation output.  We find in all simulations surface albedo anomalies are attenuated by approximately half in Northern Hemisphere land areas as they are transformed into planetary albedo anomalies.   The intermodel standard deviation in this factor is surprisingly small, less than 10% of the mean.  Moreover, when we calculate an observational estimate of this factor by applying the same method to the satellite-based ISCCP data, we find most simulations agree with ISCCP values to within about 10%, in spite of further disagreements between observed and simulated cloud fields.  This suggests even large relative errors in simulated cloud fields do not result in significant error in this factor, enhancing confidence in climate models.  The second factor, related exclusively to surface processes, is the change in surface albedo associated with an anthropogenically-induced temperature change in Northern Hemisphere land areas.  It exhibits much more intermodel variability.  Its standard deviation is about 1/3 of the mean, with the largest value being approximately three times larger than the smallest.  Therefore this factor is unquestionably the main source of the large divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback.  To reduce the divergence, attention should be focused on differing parameterizations of snow processes, rather than intermodel variations in the attenuation effect of the atmosphere on surface albedo anomalies.','in_press','J.

Snow albedo feedback is particularly critical for climate change prediction in heavily-populated northern hemisphere land masses.  Here we show its strength in current models exhibits a factor-of-three spread.  These large intermodel variations in feedback strength in climate change are nearly perfectly correlated with comparably large intermodel variations in feedback strength in the context of the seasonal cycle.  Moreover, the feedback strength in the real seasonal cycle can be measured and compared to simulated values.  These mostly fall outside the range of the observed estimate, suggesting many models have an unrealistic snow albedo feedback in the seasonal cycle context.  Because of the tight correlation between simulated feedback strength in the seasonal cycle and climate change, eliminating the model errors in the seasonal cycle will lead directly to a reduction in the spread of feedback strength in climate change.  Though this comparison to observations may put the models in an unduly harsh light because of uncertainties in the observed estimate that are difficult to quantify, our results map out a clear strategy for targeted observation of the seasonal cycle to reduce divergence in simulations of climate sensitivity.','published','Geophys.

The simulated annular patterns exhibit a high spatial correlation with the observed patterns during the late 20th century, though the mode represents too large a percentage of total temporal variability within each hemisphere. In response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols, the multimodel average exhibits a positive annular trend in both hemispheres, with decreasing sea level pressure (SLP) over the pole and a compensating increase in midlatitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trend agrees in sign but is of smaller amplitude than that observed during recent decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, decreasing stratospheric ozone causes an additional reduction in Antarctic surface pressure during the latter half of the 20th century. While annular trends in the multimodel average are positive, individual model trends vary widely. Not all models predict a decrease in high-latitude SLP, although no model exhibits an increase. As a test of the models\' annular sensitivity, the response to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is calculated during the winter following five major tropical eruptions. The observed response exhibits coupling between stratospheric anomalies and annular variations at the surface, similar to the coupling between these levels simulated elsewhere by models in response to increasing GHG concentration. The multimodel average is of the correct sign but significantly smaller in magnitude than the observed annular anomaly. This suggests that the models underestimate the coupling of stratospheric changes to annular variations at the surface and may not simulate the full response to increasing GHGs.','published','J.

It is recognized that the changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events are likely to have a larger impact than changes in mean climate. We propose to assess the expected changes in climate extremes over southern South America through the analysis of the indices of the IPCC 4th Assessment Model Output for the present climate (IPCC20C3M). These \"extreme indices\" are derived data, from simulated daily temperature and precipitation, in the form of annual indicator time series. In this paper, for the common period 1960-2000, the mean, standard deviation and mean square error between the grid point from different models and the nearest station was calculated. The indices that could be comparable are: FD: annual occurrence of frost days (days with MinT <0ºC), Tn90: percentage of days where MinT was above the 90th percentile of the 1961-90 base period. R10: number of heavy precipitation days > 10mm (R10), CDD: consecutive dry days  and R5D: maximum 5-day precipitation.  The available models are CCSM3 (CCSM),USA CNRM-CM3, (CNRM), France GFDL-CM2 .0 (GFDL0) GFDL-CM2.1 (GFDL), USA, INM-CM3.0-Russia (INM), MIROC high-resolution MIROC), MIROC medre-resolution (MIRMED), Japan, and PCM, USA (PCM)\r\nIn general, it is necessary to think that the values of the models on the Andes cannot be evaluated by the failing of the models in interpreting the orography. If we center the analysis in the Southeast of South America,  a low land region  which has more dense information, one sees that the average value is well simulated, the station values has similar values over regions, and are of the same order of magnitude, as in case of the models. In some cases, as the model GFDL, FD\'s average values are well simulated. The interannual variability from days to weeks in average, also is in good agreement.  Another temperature extreme, a warm one, Tn90, (being an index percentile-based, is relative to the local climate), It seems to be better represented that the FD. The consecutive dry days are more difficult to be simulated, since the region has a marked precipitation gradient that is not properly represented. The maximums of dryness over central Argentina Andes could not be represented for any model. On the other hand, the extensive dry season of the Amazon, is displeased and exaggerated in GFDL, whereas it does not exist for CCSM3. An index that measures the quantity of extreme rainfall, (R5d) shows in all the models that the quantity of rainfall is underestimated and there the differences of rate of rainfall are not clear. The one that better approaches the average values is the MIROC3.2. When the number of days is evaluated by extreme rainfall (R10), without considering how much it precipitated, the maps are more similar. The Amazon interannual variability is well  simulated.\r\n','published','8th ICSHMO Proceedings of 8 ICSHMO, Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil, April 24-28, 2006, INPE','2006','','379-389.','ISBN 85-17-00023-4','http://gemini.dpi.inpe.br/col/dpi.inpe.br/Gemini@80/2006/04.05.15.27/doc/capa.h','2006-05-17 07:37:30','2006-05-17 07:39:10','rusticucci','rusticucci',1),(171,123,'Sang-Wook Yeh, Young-Gyu Park and Ben P.

By comparing the MRI and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamical Laboratory (GFDL) models, both of which simulate ENSO reasonably well for the unperturbed climate, we investigate the origin of the sensitivity or lack of sensitivity of the ENSO amplitude to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. It is found that in the MRI model the oceanic sensitivity to the equatorial zonal wind stress is significantly decreased in the doubled CO2 period compared to the transient period.

Reproducing this decadal variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, but with considerable variability in magnitude among models. Eight models generated warm anomalies at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization but not their timing. However, the durations of the early warm event in all the models are shorter than the observed.  Large region-to-region, year-to-year, ensemble to ensemble, and model to model variability are seen in the simulations. These results suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability, and one should not expect each ensemble member to have a year-to-year correspondence to the observed time series. Further, the variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations. Five models compare favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly magnitude in their 20C3M simulation. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data. ','submitted','J.

Furthermore, the exponential coefficient is not a constant but varies from location to location and exhibits a systematic relationship with the local mean temperature and precipitation as well as other geographical parameters. These properties allow an estimation of extreme values in form of high percentiles, once the mean conditions are known. Furthermore, given changes in the mean local climate, it is possible to infer changes in the extremes. A new multi-model ensemble of the most recent climate simulations, carried out for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, due to be published in 2007 (the fourth assessment report - AR4), has been subject to empirical-statistical downscaling and provides best-estimates for the continuing trends in mean temperatures and precipitation in northern Europe. These scenarios are used in conjunction with the established relationship between the exponential coefficient m of the distribution function on the one hand, and local mean temperature and precipitation for year 2050 based on previous work on the other, to infer changes in the 95-percentiles of the rainfall for year 2050. This approach is different to previous work based on regional climate models or more traditional means of statistical downscaling applied directly to climate extreme indices. This new independent analysis points towards an increase in the number of extreme precipitation events and very slight change in the number of rainy days over large parts of the Nordic countries.','published','Climate Research','2007','34','195-210','doi: 10.3354/cr00693','http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr_oa/c034p195.pdf','2006-05-30 00:51:30','2007-09-24 06:54:23','rasmus','rasmus',1),(175,126,'Benestad, R.E., I.

Statistical models using both sea level pressure and large-scale precipitation as predictor are evaluated for a number of locations in Fennoscandia. The statistical models in most cases were capable of capturing 60%--80% of the year-to-year seasonal variations in precipitation and a correlation analysis over independent data indicated predictive skills scores in the range 0.2--0.5. A comparison between statistical models based on large-scale precipitation, sea level pressure, and a mixture of these, indicated similar skills in terms of variance and predictive skill of inter-annual variations. Analyses of their ability to capture recent precipitation trends reveal potential problems regarding reconstructing long-term changes in the past. One explanation for why the statistical models do not give similar past trend values as the station observations may partly be that precipitation trends during the most recent 50 years are not well defined because the interval is not sufficiently long. This is supported by the fact that trend analysis for station observations based on two different data products, and different trend-analysis strategies do not correspond well with each other. An analysis of possible non-stationarities between large and local spatial scales does not indicate significant presence of non-stationarities.','published','Int. J.

We analyze 20th Century simulations using nine state-of-the-art climate models and show that all models estimate a global annual mean reduction in downward surface solar radiation of 1-4 W/m2 at the same time that the globe warms by 0.4-0.7°¦ C. In single forcing simulations using the GISS-ER model, this \"global dimming\" signal is shown to be predominantly related to aerosol effects. In the global mean sense the surface adjusts to changes in downward solar flux instantaneously by reducing the upward fluxes of longwave, latent and sensible heat. Adding increased greenhouse gas forcing traps outgoing longwave radiation in the atmosphere and surface which results in net heating (although reduced) that is consistent with global warming over the 20th Century. Over the 1984-2000 period, individual model simulations show widely disparate results, mostly related to cloud changes associated with tropical Pacific variations, similar to the changes inferred from the satellite data analysis. This suggests that this time period is not sufficient to determine longer term trends.','published','Geophys. Res.

It is found that all three models have a stronger response in the greenhouse effect of water vapor than that indicated in Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. The overestimate is most severe in the T85 CAM3 (up to 36%). Compared with National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, all three models have an excessive response of atmospheric moisture content in the upper troposphere, suggesting a cause for the excessive response in the greenhouse effect of water vapor. The response in the greenhouse effect of clouds (the longwave forcing of clouds) in two of the models (CAM2 and T42 CAM3) is significantly weaker than that indicated in ERBE observations, but it is comparable to the observed in the T85 CAM3. The improvement in the T85 CAM3 in simulating the response in the greenhouse effect is helped by a stronger response in the middle level clouds in the model (compared to CAM2 and T42 CAM3). In contrast to the strong negative response in the shortwave forcing seen in the ERBE observations, the response of the shortwave forcing of clouds in the CAM2 and the T42 CAM3 is weak and even has a sign opposite to observations when it is averaged over the entire region of surface warming. The simulation of the response of the shortwave forcing in the T85 CAM3 is considerably improved, though the negative response over the equatorial Pacific is still not strong enough compared to ERBE observations. The stronger negative response in the shortwave forcing in the T85 CAM3 is apparently linked to a stronger response in the middle level cloud cover. All three models fail to simulate the observed pattern of the response in the low cloud cover over the central and eastern Pacific, resulting in deficiency in the response of the shortwave cloud forcing in that region. The deficiency in the low cloud cover response suggests that the low cloud cover scheme has room for improvement.','published','J. Geophys.

In order to assess uncertainties that are due to model formulation, 4 regional climate models (RCMs) with 5 high resolution experiments, and 4 global general circulation models (GCMs) are considered. Firstly, cyclone systems as synoptic scale processes in winter are investigated, as they are a principal cause of the occurrence of extreme, damage-causing wind speeds. This is achieved by use of an objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm applied to GCMs. Secondly, changes in extreme near-surface wind speeds are analysed. Based on\r\npercentile thresholds, the studied extreme wind speed indices allow a consistent analysis over Europe that takes systematic deviations of the models into account. Relative changes in both intensity and frequency of extreme winds and their related uncertainties are assessed and related to changing patterns of extreme cyclones. A common feature of all investigated GCMs is a reduced track density over central Europe under climate change conditions, if all systems are considered. If only extreme (i.e. the strongest 5%) cyclones are taken into account, an increasing cyclone activity for western parts of central Europe is apparent; however, the climate change signal reveals a reduced spatial coherency when compared to all systems, which exposes partially contrary results. With respect to extreme wind speeds, significant positive changes in intensity and frequency are obtained over at least 3 and 20% of the European domain under study (35–72° N and 15°W–43° E), respectively. \r\nLocation and extension of the affected areas (up to 60 and 50% of the domain for intensity and frequency, respectively), as well as levels of changes (up to +15 and +200% for intensity and frequency, respectively) are shown to be highly dependent on the driving GCM, whereas differences between RCMs when driven by the same GCM are relatively small.','published','Climate Research','2006','31','59-74','','http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v31/n1/p59-74/','2006-06-30 06:28:30','2006-06-30 06:28:30','leckebusch','leckebusch',1),(179,668,'Gleckler, P.J., T.

Volcanically induced cooling of the ocean surface penetrated into deeper layers, where it persisted for decades after the event. This remarkable effect on oceanic thermal structure is longer lasting than has previously been suspected and is sufficient to offset a large fraction of ocean warming and sea-level rise caused by anthropogenic influences.  An oceanic response to the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, which was comparable to Krakatoa in terms of its radiative forcing, has been identified in satellite altimetry data. The simulated heat-content recovery after Pinatubo seems to occur much more rapidly than for Krakatoa. This disparity arises because the Pinatubo response is superimposed on a non-stationary background of large and increasing greenhouse-gas forcing. The heat-content effects of Pinatubo and other eruptions in the late twentieth century are offset by the observed warming of the upper ocean, which is primarily due to anthropogenic influences.\r\n','published','Nature','2006','439','675','doi:10.1038/439675a','','2006-07-03 15:37:43','2006-07-12 11:04:56','pgleckler','pgleckler',1),(181,119,'Vera, C., G.

Part II: Influence of SH circulation leading patterns.','The ability of the climate model simulations performed for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in reproducing the leading patterns of atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and their influence on precipitation variability in South America are discussed here, using the same subset of the climate simulations of the 20th century (20c3m) described in Part I. CMAP precipitation dataset and NCEP-NCAR reanalyses were used to describe the observed patterns. The leading patterns of circulation in the SH were identified through an analysis of the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) for the 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies over the SH, southward of 20°S.  Regression and correlation maps were computed for observations and model simulations. For those models that an ensemble of runs are available, the maps were first computed per individual run and then averaged over all runs available for each model.\r\n\r\nIt was found that all models are able to reproduce a first leading pattern resembling the SAM. On the other hand, just some of them can reproduce PSA-like structure associated with the second and third leading patterns. The analysis suggests that GFDL, GISS and MPI are the models that reproduce patterns more similar to those observed. Regarding the observed relationship between ENSO and SH circulation anomalies and precipitation anomalies in South America, it was found that most of the model second leading patterns are significantly correlated with ENSO. Nevertheless, there is considerable dispersion among models regarding the ENSO amplitude and the SH circulation response to ENSO. It was also found not only for model results but also for NCEP, that both ENSO-related signal and that of SAM were projected onto more than one EOF. This result can be associated with limitations in the EOF technique in separating physical modes and/or sampling errors associated with the length of the period considered. The relationship between monthly mean precipitation anomalies and the three leading patterns of SH circulation variability show that most of the models reproduced the SAM influence onto precipitation variability at the southern Andes. On the other hand, just a few of them were able to reproduce the observed influence of both PSA1 and PSA2 on South American precipitation variability. The last result can be associated with model deficiencies in reproducing the ENSO cycle and its remote influence on the SH circulation variability. \r\n\r\n','published','Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Southern Hemisphere Meteorology and Oceanography, Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil, April 24-28, 2006.','2006','','477-486','','','2006-07-17 14:28:45','2006-07-17 14:33:35','cvera','cvera',1),(183,200,'Claire L.

Averaged over all those model simulations, the current climate is reasonably well reproduced.  However, this averaging procedure hides the errors from individual models.  Over the 20th century, the multimodel average simulates a larger sea-ice concentration decrease around the Antarctic Peninsula compared to other regions, which is in qualitative agreement with observations.  This is likely related to the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index over the 20th century, in both observations and in the multimodel average.  Despite the simulated positive future trend in SAM, such a regional feature around the Antarctic Peninsula is absent in the projected sea-ice change for the end of the 21st century.  The maximum decrease is indeed located over the central Weddell Sea and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas.  In most models, changes in the oceanic currents could play a role in the regional distribution of the sea ice, especially in the Ross Sea, where stronger southward currents could also be responsible for a smaller sea-ice decrease during the 21st century.

The volcanically-induced cooling of the ocean surface is subducted into deeper ocean layers, where it persists for decades. Temporary reductions in ocean heat content associated with the comparable eruptions of El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo (1991) were much shorter lived because they occurred relative to a non-stationary background of large, anthropogenically-forced ocean warming. Our results suggest that inclusion of the effects of Krakatoa (and perhaps even earlier eruptions) is important for reliable simulation of 20th century ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion. Inter-model differences in the oceanic thermal response to Krakatoa are large and arise from differences in external forcing, model physics, and experimental design. Systematic experimentation is required to quantify the relative importance of these factors. The next generation of historical forcing experiments may require more careful treatment of pre-industrial volcanic aerosol loadings. \r\n\r\n','published','Geophysical Research Letters','2006','33','4','doi:10.1029/2006GL026771','http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2006GL026771.shtml','2006-09-08 14:08:47','2006-09-08 14:08:47','pgleckler','pgleckler',1),(230,231,'Leroy, S.S., J.G.

Trends in the global average surface air temperature show better overall agreement over the first 50 years than in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, but the patterns of global surface air temperature trends show little improvement in intermodel agreement. These same twelve models show qualitatively better agreement in their patterns of upper air temperature trends. All show maintenance of a moist adiabatic temperature profile in the tropics, making tropospheric temperature trends the greatest at 200 hPa in the tropics. We test the climate models\' predictions using optimal fingerprinting. In order to do so, we use long preindustrial control runs of four of the IPCC AR4 models. Simulating trends in the log of the vertically integrated microwave refractivity, or ``dry\'\' pressure, of the atmosphere is nearly the same as measuring trends in geopotential heights of constant pressure surfaces. The first four EOFs of interannual variability of log-dry pressure, as determined by two independent climate models, are ENSO, modes closely associated with the southern and northern annular modes, and a previously unidentified symmetric jet migration EOF. The latter is characterized by poleward migration of the eddy-driven midlatitude jet correlated between hemispheres. The ENSO mode and especially the symmetric jet migration EOF contribute most to optimal detection and are similarly predicted by the IPCC AR4 models. The common prediction of all climate models will be tested with 95% confidence with GPS radio occultation data in 7 to 13 years.

Successful simulation of such features in the ocean is an important prerequisite for confidence in predictions of the ocean’s response to future freshwater anomalies from ice melt or sub-polar river discharge. The coupled climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offer a unique cross-section of model formulations, resolutions and scenarios with which to explore climate models’ ability to produce GSAs. The performance of nine different models, with a range of horizontal and vertical atmospheric and oceanic resolutions, in producing GSAs was examined using a base period of 100 years. One scenario was a pre-industrial control simulation, while the other was forced by an increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide of an enhanced greenhouse world (scenario sresa1b). It was found that the strongest control on the existence of model GSAs was the oceanic horizontal resolution. This needed to be of the order of 1.5o or less for GSAs to occur within the model. In those models which possessed GSAs these were overwhelmingly generated within the Labrador Sea, with similar periodicities to those observed. Anomalies reaching the Greenland Sea through the Nordic Sea gyre circulations generally slowed and died before propagating back into the Atlantic. Freshwater flow through the Canadian Archipelago appears to be an important factor in producing the most realistic simulation. Within the greenhouse world GSAs were significantly less likely to occur, were weaker and more likely to originate from east of Greenland. ','published','J. Geophys.

This is equally important for surface and cloud-atmosphere applications. In this paper, we present the SPARC (Separation of Pixels using Aggregated Rating over Canada) algorithm, a new method of pixel identification for image data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the NOAA satellites. The SPARC algorithm separates image pixels into clear-sky and cloudy categories based on a specially designed rating scheme. A mask depicting snow/ice and cloud shadows is also generated. The SPARC algorithm has been designed to work year round (day and night) over the temperate and polar regions of North America, for current and historical AVHRR/NOAA High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) and Local Area Coverage (LAC) data with original 1-km spatial resolution. The algorithm was tested and applied to data from the AVHRR sensors flown onboard NOAA-6 to NOAA-18. The method was employed in generating historical clear-sky composites for the 1982-2005 period at daily, 10-day and monthly time-scales at 1-km resolution for an area of 5700×4800 km2 centered over Canada. This region also covers the northern part of the United States including Alaska, as well as Greenland and the surrounding oceans.\r\nThe SPARC algorithm is designed to produce an aggregated rating that accumulates the results of several tests. The magnitude of the rating serves as an indicator of the probability for a pixel to belong to clear-sky, partly cloudy or overcast categories. The individual tests employ the spectral properties of 5 AVHRR channels, as well as surface the skin temperature maps from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset. These temperature fields are available at 32×32 km2 spatial resolution and at 3 hour time intervals. Combining all test results into one final rating for each pixel is beneficial for the generation of multi-scene clear-sky composites. The selection of the best pixel to be used in the final clear-sky product is based on the magnitude of the rating. This provides much improved results relative to other approaches or “yes/no” decision methods.\r\nThe SPARC method has been compared to the results of supervised classification for a number of AVHRR scenes representing various seasons (snow-free summer, winter with snow/ice coverage and transition seasons).

How increased CO2 and changing climate influence the carbon cycle of the terrestrial China ecosystems is still unclear although it is important to understand the carbon dynamics.  In this article, we used a process-based ecosystem model, Biome-BGC, to isolate the effects of changing climate and elevated atmospheric CO2 on the terrestrial China carbon cycle during two time periods, (1) the present (1961-2000) and (2) a future with projected climate change under doubled CO2 (2071-2110).  The effects of climate change alone were estimated by driving Biome-BGC with the fixed CO2 and the changing climate, and the CO2 fertilization effects were the difference of the results driven by both increasing CO2 and changing climate to those by variable climate alone.  Model simulations indicate that, during 1961-2000, at the national scale, climate change alone reduced carbon stored in China’s ecosystems, but increasing CO2 compensated for the adverse effects of climate change, resulting in the increased carbon storage by China’s ecosystems despite of the decreased soil carbon.  The interannual variability of the carbon cycle was associated with climate variations.  Spatially, the normally reduced carbon in vegetation and soils, and the raised carbon in litter were mainly caused by climate change in most parts of East China, while carbon in vegetation, soils and litter increased nearly all over West China.  In the future (2071-2110), with doubled CO2, higher precipitation and temperature will occur all over China as predicted by the Hadley Centre HadCM3 for the IPCC Fourth Assessment.  The concomitant doubling of CO2 will continue to counteract the negative effects of climate change on carbon uptake in the future, leading to an increase in carbon storage relative to the present.  Regional differences in climate change produced differing regional carbon uptake responses.  This study highlights the role of CO2 fertilization in the carbon budget of China ecosystems, though it did not include other important processes such as land use change, human management practices (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and environmental pollutions, etc.','submitted','Journal of Geophysical Research - Biogeosciences','','','','','','2007-08-02 11:49:38','2007-08-02 11:49:38','NTSG','NTSG',1),(201,457,'Sujata K.

The patterns of wind onset and withdrawal show that the earliest wind onset in monsoon regions is found over equator around 70°-100°E, the wind retreat contrast to the wind onset shown a southward progression in tropics. In addition, a notable temporal boundary is found around 25°N in the subtropical western North Pacific, which may be related to the northward advance and southward retreat of the western Pacific subtropical high. The rotational amplitudes of wind vector in wind onset and withdrawal have regional differences in Asian monsoon regions. Since the process of monsoon onset (withdrawal) may include abruptions of several variables without simultaneity, the relationships of the dates of onset and withdrawal with the abrupt time of other variables (e.g. reversal of zonal wind, OLR, precipitation) are investigated. The results indicate the temporal differences in different monsoon regions confirmed the asynchronous abruption. It also implies that the wind onset might be a good omen for monsoon precipitation in some regions since it is slightly earlier than rainy season onset. Seven model results from AMIP AR4 are validated against observations mentioned above. On the whole, most models appear to more correctly reproduce the broad features of the wind withdrawal than those of the wind onset. For wind onset, IAP-FGOALS-1.0g, MIROC3.2 (medres) and MPI-ECHAM5 simulate reasonably well. For wind retreats, most models can capture the behaviors in tropics. However, there are still notable shortcomings in some models to simulate this transitional characteristic of wind direction in monsoon onset and withdrawal which need further improvement.','submitted','Climate Dynamics','','','','','','2006-12-05 21:22:21','2006-12-05 21:35:28','katebj','katebj',1),(199,524,'Zhang Li and Jianping Li','Another Look at Monsoon Annual Variability and Its Application to Evaluate Monsoon Simulation in AMIP Models. Part I: Wind Vector Rotational Regimes','Based on the seasonal reversal of wind vector which is the essential characteristic of monsoon, a new concept, the directed angle, is introduced to study rotational regimes of global wind vector and monsoon annul variability. Compared with the previous studies using angle between wind vectors, this concept better reflects the daily variations of wind direction including the rotational direction and amplitude. According to the concept, six categories of wind vector rotation with seasonal cycle have been detected and classified as follows: (I) Clockwise to counter-clockwise rotation; (II) Counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation; (III) Full clockwise rotation; (IV) Full counter-clockwise rotation; (V) Stable style; (VI) Instable style. In monsoon regions, the wind generally rotates in the forms of the first four categories with seasonal evolution. The global distribution pattern of wind vector rotation regime shows that different rotational styles of wind vector are closely related to seasonal evolution of atmospheric circulation systems, including the strength and movement of trough and ridge, the development, movement and split of anticyclone or cyclone, as well as the seasonal variation of solar radiation. Moreover, different monsoon systems possess different wind vector rotational styles with seasonal evolution, for instance, the South Asian monsoon is the style II while the East Asian monsoon is the style IV, the style I is showed in the South China Sea, and the style III in the South Indo-China Peninsula and the West Africa. In addition, this study\r\nemployed this new concept to evaluate the model outputs of 8 AGCMs of AMIP in\r\nIPCC 4th assessment. The results show that this application not only reflects the dynamic process and global distribution of wind vector rotational styles in monsoon simulation, but also embodies the abilities for AGCMs to reproducing circulation seasonal variations. In general, most models show the global distribution pattern reasonable well compared to the corresponding observations, but so little skill is shown in the monsoon rotational styles of some models, especially in South China Sea and West Africa. Moreover, the simulations differ mostly from observations during the transitional season.','submitted','Climate Dynamics','','','','','','2006-12-05 21:23:41','2006-12-05 21:35:52','katebj','katebj',1),(203,600,'Jennifer Alltop','A Compararive study','Studey of precipitation\r\n','published','','','','','','','2007-01-22 22:30:24','2007-01-22 22:30:24','shinshu24','shinshu24',1),(204,640,'Scherrer, S.

All data sets and model runs are scaled by their corresponding interannual variability to facilitate the comparison between the datasets. Time series are detrended to investigate changes in internal variability. For the last 45 years (1961-2005) the strongest changes in mean are found for in the summer mean temperature, both in observations and AR4 runs. With the exception of autumn, changes in the mean are captured reasonably well by the models on the regional as well as hemispheric scale.

The AR4 model-to-model differences in the mean changes are largest in summer and not substantially smaller than those from the third assessment report (TAR). Model uncertainties are in the same order or even larger than the uncertainty introduced by the different scenarios. Compared to TAR, the AR4 runs show a much more consistent tendency for increases in Central Europe summer temperature variability especially towards the end of the 21st century (for 2070-2099: ~22% to 47% increase).

We focus on the three major components of Asian summer monsoon: the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM), and the east Asian summer monsoon (EASM), together with the two dominant intraseasonal modes: the eastward and northward propagating boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSIO) and the westward propagating 12-24 day mode.\r\n\r\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs display a wide range of skill in simulating the intraseasonal variability associated with Asian summer monsoon. During boreal summer (May-October), most of the models produce reasonable seasonal mean precipitation over the ISM region, but excessive precipitation over WNPSM region and insufficient precipitation over EASM region. In other words, models concentrate their rain too close to the equator in the Western Pacific. Most of the models simulate overly weak total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance, as well as too little variance for BSIO and the 12-24 day mode. Moreover, models often have difficulty in simulating the eastward propagation of BSIO. Nevertheless, many models simulate well the northward propagation of BSIO, together with the westward propagation of the 12-24 day mode. The northward propagation in these models is thus not simply a NW-SE tilted tail protruding off of an eastward-moving deep-tropical intraseasonal oscillation. Only 4-5 models produce spectral peaks in the BSIO and 12-24 day frequency bands; instead, most of the models display too red a spectrum, i.e. an overly strong persistence of precipitation.\r\n','submitted','Journal of Climate','2007','','','','http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/jialin.lin/','2007-02-04 15:37:00','2007-02-04 15:37:00','jlin','jlin',1),(207,10,'Lin, Jia-Lin','Interdecadal variability of ENSO in 21 IPCC AR4 coupled GCMs','This study evaluates the interdecadal variability of ENSO in 21 IPCC AR4 CGCMs. 110 years of the Climate of the 20th Century (20C3M) simulations are analyzed using wavelet analysis.

The 20th century climate simulations of 22 IPCC AR4 CGCMs are analyzed, together with the available AMIP runs from 12 of them. To understand the physical mechanisms for the double-ITCZ problem, the main ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, including the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient&#8722;trade wind feedback (or Bjerknes feedback), the SST&#8722;surface latent heat flux (LHF) feedback, and the SST&#8722;surface shortwave flux (SWF) feedback, are studied in detail. \r\n\r\nThe results show that most of the current state-of-the-art CGCMs have some degree of the double-ITCZ problem, which is characterized by excessive precipitation over much of the tropics (e.g. northern hemisphere ITCZ, South Pacific Convergence Zone, maritime continent, and equatorial Indian Ocean), and often associated with insufficient precipitation over equatorial Pacific. The excessive precipitation over much of the tropics usually causes overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF and insufficient SWF, leading to significant cold SST bias in much of the tropical oceans. Most of the models also simulate insufficient latitudinal asymmetry in precipitation and SST over eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\nThe AMIP runs also produce excessive precipitation over much of the tropics including equatorial Pacific, which also leads to overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF and insufficient SWF. This suggests that the excessive tropical precipitation is an intrinsic error of the atmospheric models, and that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in the coupled runs of many models comes from ocean-atmosphere feedback. Feedback analysis demonstrates that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in different models is associated with one or more of the following three biases in ocean-atmosphere feedback over equatorial Pacific: (1) excessive Bjerknes feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of precipitation to SST and overly strong time-mean surface wind speed; (2) overly positive SST-LHF feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of surface air humidity to SST; and (3) insufficient SST-SWF feedback, which is caused by insufficient sensitivity of cloud amount to precipitation. Off the equator over the eastern Pacific stratus region, most of the models produce insufficient stratus-SST feedback associated with insufficient sensitivity of stratus cloud amount to SST, which may contribute to the insufficient latitudinal asymmetry of SST in their coupled runs. These results suggest that the double-ITCZ problem in CGCMs may be alleviated by reducing the excessive tropical precipitation and the above feedback-relevant errors in the atmospheric models.\r\n','in_press','Journal of Climate','2007','','','','http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/jialin.lin/publication.html','2007-02-04 15:41:04','2007-07-25 18:42:17','jlin','jlin',1),(209,740,'Lu, J., G.

Despite the large changes in the tropical Pacific mean state, the changes in ENSO amplitude are highly model dependant. In order to investigate why similar mean state changes lead to very different ENSO amplitude changes, we analyze the characteristics of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) variability simulated in two coupled general circulation models (CGCMs): the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) models. The skewed distribution of tropical Pacific SSTA simulated in the MRI model suggests the importance of non-linearities in the ENSO physics, whereas the GFDL model lies in the linear regime. Consistent with these differences in ENSO regime, the GFDL is insensitive to the mean state changes, whereas the MRI model is sensitive to the mean state changes associated with the 4xCO2 scenario. Similarly, the low frequency modulation of ENSO amplitude in the GFDL model is related to atmospheric stochastic forcing, but in the MRI model the amplitude modulation is insensitive to the noise forcing. These results suggest that the understanding of changes in ENSO statistics among various climate change projections is highly dependent on whether the model ENSO is in the linear or non-linear regime.','published','Journal of climate','2007','20','203-217','','','2007-02-20 17:21:58','2007-02-27 00:09:51','swyeh','swyeh',1),(212,213,'Kharin, V.V., F.

The strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation decreases as the climate warms inall IPCC-AR4 models, in a manner consistent with the thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and Soden (2006). The weakening occurs preferentially in the zonally-asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley) component of the tropical circulation and is shown to induce substantial changes to the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the overall circulation weakens by decreasing the frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the frequency of weak updrafts; although the robustness of this behavior across all models cannot be confirmed due to lack of data. As the climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean resemble “El Nin&#771;o-like” conditions; however, the mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El Nin&#771;o and are reproduced in both mixed-layer and full ocean dynamics coupled climate models.

For the models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), this weakening shows a significant (r=0.62) dependence on the initial THC strength: it is stronger for initially strong overturning. We propose a physical mechanism for this phenomenon based on an analysis of additional simulations with the coupled climate models CLIMBER-2 and CLIMBER-3. The mechanism is based on the fact that sea ice cover greatly reduces heat loss from the ocean. The extent of sea ice is strongly influenced by the near surface atmospheric temperature (SAT) in the North Atlantic but also by the strength of the THC itself which transports heat to the convection sites. Consequently, sea ice tends to extend further south for weaker THC. Initially larger sea-ice cover responds more strongly to atmospheric warming, thus sea ice retreats more strongly for an initially weaker THC. This sea ice retreat tends to strengthen, i.e. stabilize, the THC because the sea ice retreat allows more oceanic heat loss. This stabilizing effect is stronger for runs with weak initial THC and extensive sea ice cover. Therefore an initially weak THC weakens less under global warming. In contrast to pre-industrial climate, sea ice melting presently plays the role of an external forcing with respect to THC stability.','published','Journal of Climate','2007','20','4160-4171','','http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/publications/linearity-moc-co2.pdf','2007-02-27 00:01:34','2007-07-25 23:41:29','anders','anders',1),(220,209,'Wild, M., Long, C.N., and Ohmura, A.','Evaluation of clear-sky solar fluxes in GCMs participating in AMIP and IPCC-AR4 from a surface perspective','Solar fluxes at the Earth’s surface calculated in General Circulation Models (GCMs)\r\ncontain large uncertainties, not only in the presence of clouds but, as shown here, even\r\nunder clear-sky (i.e., cloud-free) conditions.

This review attempts to give an overview of this important but difficult topic by using three main lines of evidence: the skill of models in simulating present-day climate, intermodel agreement on future climate changes, and the ability of models to simulate climate changes that have already occurred. A comparison of simulated and observed present-day climates shows good agreement for many basic variables, particularly at large horizontal scales, and a tendency for biases to vary in sign between different models, but there is a risk that these features might be partly a result of tuning. Overall, the connection between model skill in simulating present-day climate and the skill in simulating future climate changes is poorly known. An intercomparison of future climate changes between models shows a better agreement for changes in temperature than precipitation and sea level pressure, but some aspects of change in the latter two variables are also quite consistent between models. A comparison of simulations with observed climate changes is, in principle, a good test for the models, but there are several complications. Nonetheless, models have skilfully simulated many large-scale aspects of observed climate changes, including but not limited to the evolution of the global mean surface air temperature in the 20th century. Furthermore, although there is no detailed agreement between the simulated and observed geographical patterns of change, the grid box scale temperature, precipitation and pressure changes observed during the past half-century generally fall within the range of model results. Considering the difficulties associated with other sources of information, the variation of climate changes between different models is probably the most meaningful measure of uncertainty that is presently available. In general, however, this measure is more likely to underestimate than overestimate the actual uncertainty.','published','Tellus','2007','59A','2-29','doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0870.2006.00211.x','http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/toc/tea/59/1','2007-02-27 00:55:17','2007-02-27 00:55:17','jaraisan','jaraisan',1),(222,209,'Wild, M.','Solar radiation budgets in atmospheric model intercomparisons from a surface perspective','Solar radiation budgets from 20 general circulation\r\nmodels (GCMs) participating in the second phase of the\r\nAtmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIPII) are\r\nanalyzed.

First, to account for differences between simulated and observed climate variability, a variance correction technique is devised. Second, the sensitivity of the forecasts to the choice of the baseline period is studied. In southern Finland, the variance correction technique generally widens the derived probability distributions of precipitation change, mirroring an underestimate of the observed precipitation variability in climate models. However, the impact on the derived probability distributions of temperature change is small. The choice of the baseline period is generally more important, but again the forecasts of temperature change are less sensitive to different options than those of precipitation change. Cross-verification suggests that the variance correction leads to a slight improvement in the potential quality of the probabilistic forecasts, especially for precipitation change. The optimal baseline length appears to be at least 30 years, and the baseline should be as late as possible (e.g., 1971-2000 is preferable over 1961-1990).','published','Tellus','2007','59A','309-320',' doi:10.1111/j.1600-0870.2007.00233.x','http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/toc/tea/59/3','2007-02-27 00:59:26','2007-08-03 03:33:09','jaraisan','jaraisan',1),(224,748,'Brohan, P. and S.

The global land/sea warming ratio varies in the range 1.36–1.84, independent of global mean temperature change. In the presence of increasing radiative forcing, the warming ratio for a single model is fairly constant in time, implying that the land/sea temperature difference increases with time. The warming ratio varies with latitude, with a minimum in equatorial latitudes, and maxima in the subtropics. A simple explanation for these findings is provided, and comparisons are made with observations. For the low-latitude (40°S–40°N) mean, the models suggest a warming ratio of 1.51 ± 0.13, while recent observations suggest a ratio of 1.54 ± 0.09.','published','Geophys. Res.

This alternative approach uses incident--rather than absorbed--solar radiation to calculate shortwave cloud radiative forcing at the surface.  By removing the competing influence of surface albedo on CRF, the new formula more effectively isolates the impact of clouds and cloud changes under different climatic regimes. The removal of surface albedo effects makes the change in CRF a more useful measure of cloud feedback, although other factors (such as changes in clear-sky solar absorption) can still muddle the interpretation.  I present examples from GCM greenhouse simulations that demonstrate how this new formula can help to differentiate between actual cloud feedbacks versus apparent ones induced by snow and ice meltback using the traditional CRF equation.  The results suggest that changes in surface albedo contribute approximately 20 to 40% of the high-latitude CRF anomaly using the standard formula applied to an equilibrium 2 x CO2 simulation and about 50% to the greater Arctic when used on 21st-century transient greenhouse experiments.','published','Geophysical Research Letters','2006','33','','doi:10.1029/2005GL024723','','2007-02-27 07:27:12','2007-02-27 07:27:12','vavrus','vavrus',1),(232,419,'Li, W., R.

We have further examined the UKMO-HadCM3, GISS-ER, and GFDL-CM2.1 models. Over Southeast Asia, all three models predict similar decreases of rainfall and evaporative fraction, implying an increase of water table depth and surface dryness during the dry season south of the equator.

For light precipitation (1–10 mm day&#8722;1), most models overestimate the frequency but produce patterns of the intensity that are in broad agreement with observations. In contrast, for heavy precipitation (>10 mm day&#8722;1), most models considerably underestimate the intensity but simulate the frequency relatively well. The average number of rainy days contributing to most of the annual precipitation is a simple index that captures the combined effects of precipitation frequency and intensity on the water supply.

For the emission scenarios SRES B1 (a low projection), A1B (a medium projection), and A2 (a high projection) during the 21st century, all the models consistently show a shift towards more intense and extreme precipitation for the globe as a whole and over various regions. For both SRES B1 and A2, most models show decreased daily precipitation frequency and all the models show increased daily precipitation intensity. The multi-model averaged percentage increase in the precipitation intensity (2.0% K-1) is larger than the magnitude of the precipitation frequency decrease (-0.7% K-1).  However, the shift in precipitation frequency distribution towards extremes results in large increases in very heavy precipitation events (>50 mm day-1), so that for very heavy precipitation, the percentage increase in frequency is much larger than the increase in intensity (31.2% vs. 2.4%). The climate model-projected increases in daily precipitation intensity are, however, smaller than that based on simple thermodynamics (~7% K-1). Multi-model ensemble means show that precipitation amount increases during the 21st century over high latitudes, as well as over currently wet regions in low- and mid-latitudes more than other regions. This increase mostly results from a combination of increased frequency and intensity. Over the dry regions in the subtropics, precipitation amount generally declines because of decreases in both frequency and intensity. This indicates that wet regions may get wetter and dry regions may become drier mostly because of simultaneous increase (decrease) of precipitation frequency and intensity.','in_press','J.

It is furthermore explored how this spread is related to internal variability of the climate system and the strength of the CO2 forcing. As expected, the fraction of the globe where a statistically significant climate change could be detected increased with the strength of the CO2 forcing. For temperature this fraction increased rapidly with integration time, while the increase of areas with statistically significant precipitation change was much slower. It is shown that increasing the averaging periods for estimating climate change from 20 to 40 yr reduced the spread due to internal variability by 40% in the Arctic regions. This is due to better sampling of decadal internal variability. In order to reduce sampling uncertainty below a fixed threshold, the number of ensemble members needed is much larger in the polar region than in the lower latitudes. This should be taken into account when designing modelling strategies (high-resolution modelling versus larger number of ensemble members) to reduce uncertainty in future polar climate change. At the time of doubling of CO2, the variance of the climate change estimates, based on 20 yr averages from a single model ensemble, constitutes 13% and 42% of corresponding multimodel ensemble variances for temperature and precipitation, respectively. In the case of precipitation, this indicates that some caution should be used in attributing different climate change estimates to differences in model formulations.','published','Tellus A','2006','58','565-574','doi:10.1111/j.1600-0870.2006.00202.x','http://www.uib.no/People/gbsag/publications.html','2007-02-27 09:11:41','2007-02-27 09:13:13','asgeirs','asgeirs',1),(240,667,'Lobell, D.

To evaluate uncertainties in these variables, we compared projections of Tmin and Tmax changes by 2046-2065 for 12 climate models under an A2 emission scenario. Average modeled changes in Tmin were similar to those for Tmax, with slightly greater increases in Tmin consistent with historical trends exhibiting a reduction in diurnal temperature ranges. In contrast, the inter-model variability of Tmin and Tmax projections exhibited substantial differences. For example, inter-model standard deviations of June-August Tmax changes were more than 50% greater than for Tmin throughout much of North America, Europe, and Asia. Model differences in cloud changes, which exert relatively greater influence on Tmax during summer and Tmin during winter, were identified as the main source of uncertainty disparities. These results highlight the importance of considering separately projections for Tmax and Tmin when assessing climate change impacts, even in cases where average projected changes are similar. In addition, impacts that are most sensitive to summertime Tmin or wintertime Tmax may be more predictable than suggested by analyses using only projections of daily average temperatures.','published','Geophysical Research Letters','2007','34','L05715','10.1029/2006GL028726','','2007-02-27 11:11:12','2007-07-26 08:30:17','dlobell','dlobell',1),(241,667,'Lobell, D.B., C.B.

In regions where perennial crops are economically and culturally important, improved assessments of yield responses to future climate are needed to prioritize adaptation strategies. These impact assessments, in turn, must rely on climate and crop models that contain often poorly defined uncertainties. We evaluated the impact of climate change on six major perennial crops in California: wine grapes, almonds, table grapes, oranges, walnuts, and avocados. Outputs from multiple climate models were used to evaluate climate uncertainty, while multiple statistical crop models, derived by resampling historical databases, were used to address crop response uncertainties. We find that, despite these uncertainties, climate change in California is very likely to put downward pressure on yields of almonds, walnuts, avocados, and table grapes by 2050. Without CO2 fertilization or adaptation measures, projected losses range from 0 to >40% depending on the crop and the trajectory of climate change. Climate change uncertainty generally had a larger impact on projections than crop model uncertainty, although the latter was substantial for several crops. Opportunities for expansion into cooler regions were identified, but this adaptation would require substantial investments and may be limited by non-climatic constraints. Given the long time scales for growth and production of orchards and vineyards (~30 years), climate change should be an important factor in selecting perennial varieties and deciding whether and where perennials should be planted.','published','Agricultural and Forest Meteorology','2006','141','208-218','','','2007-02-27 11:12:30','2007-02-27 11:12:30','dlobell','dlobell',1),(242,513,'E.P.

The goal of this investigation is to identify changes in cyclone activity associated with increasing concentrations. To this aim, two 50-year time periods are analysed, one representing present day climate conditions and the other a perturbed climate when CO2 concentrations exceed twice the present concentrations. Cyclone activity is assessed using an automatic algorithm, which identifies and tracks cyclones based on sea level pressure fields. The algorithm detects not only large and long living cyclones over the main ocean basins, but also their smaller counterparts in secondary storm track regions like the Mediterranean Basin. For the present climate, results show a good agreement with NCEP-reanalysis, provided that the spectral and time resolutions of the reanalysis are reduced to those available for the model. \r\n\r\nSeveral prominent changes in cyclone activity are observed for the scenario period in comparison to the present day climate, especially over the main ocean basins. A significant decrease of overall cyclone track density is found between 35 and 55 degrees North, together with a small increase polewards. These changes result from two different signals for deep and medium cyclones: for deep cyclones (core pressure below 990 hPa) there is a poleward shift in the greenhouse gas scenario, while for medium cyclones (core pressure between 990 and 1010 hPa) a general decrease in cyclone counts is found. The same kind of changes (a shift for intense cyclones and an overall decrease for the weaker ones) are detected when distinguishing cyclones from their intensity, quantified in terms of Laplacian of pressure. Thus, the simulated changes can not solely be attributed to alterations in mean sea level pressure. Instead, corresponding increases in upper-tropospheric baroclinicity suggest more favourable conditions for the development of stronger systems at higher latitudes, especially at the delta regions of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific storm tracks.\r\n\r\n','published','Meteorol.

A close agreement is found between the simulations for present day climate and the respective results from reanalysis. Significant changes in the winter mid-tropospheric storm tracks are detected in all three scenario simulations. Ensemble mean climate signals are rather similar, with particularly large activity increases downstream of the Atlantic storm track over Western Europe. The magnitude of this signal is largely dependent on the imposed change in forcing. However, differences between individual ensemble members may be large. With respect to the surface cyclones, the scenario runs produce a reduction in cyclonic track density over the mid-latitudes, even in the areas with increasing mid-tropospheric activity. The largest decrease in track densities occurs at subtropical latitudes, e.g., over the Mediterranean Basin. An increase of cyclone intensities is detected for limited areas (e.g., near Great Britain and Aleutian Isles) for the A1B and A2 experiments. The changes in synoptic activity are associated with alterations of the Northern Hemisphere circulation and background conditions (blocking frequencies, jet stream). The North Atlantic Oscillation index also shows increased values with enhanced forcing. With respect to the effects of changing synoptic activity, the regional change in cyclone intensities is accompanied by alterations of the extreme surface winds, with increasing values over Great Britain, North and Baltic Seas, as well as the areas with vanishing sea ice, and decreases over much of the subtropics.

Losses are computed based on the daily maximum wind speed for each grid point. The calibration of the loss model is performed using wind data from the ERA40-Reanalysis and German loss data.

On average, insured loss potentials increase for all analysed European regions at the end of the 21st century. Changes are largest for Germany and France, and lowest for Portugal/Spain. Additionally, the spread between the single realisations is large, ranging e.g. for Germany from +4% to +43% in terms of mean annual loss.\r\nMoreover, almost all simulations show an increasing interannual variability of storm damage. This assessment is even more pronounced if no adaptation of building structure to climate change is considered. The increased loss potentials are linked with enhanced values for the high percentiles of surface wind maxima over Western and Central Europe, which in turn are associated with an enhanced number and increased intensity of extreme cyclones over the British Isles and the North Sea.','published','Nat.

The simulated potential vegetation under the pre-industrial control (PICNTRL) climate (CO2 concentration held at 275ppm) is compared with that under the SRESA1B after-stabilization climate (CO2 concentration stabilizes at 720ppm beyond 2100). Simulated vegetation changes include increases or decreases of the fractional coverage of different plant functional types and the rather dramatic changes of the dominant plant functional types. Although such changes differ significantly across the different GCM climate projections,  a quite consistent pattern emerges, characterized by a considerable pole-ward spread or shift of temperate and boreal forests in the northern hemisphere high latitudes, and a substantial degradation of vegetation cover in the tropics especially in portions of West and southern Africa and South America. Despite the widespread vegetation degradation in the tropics, net primary productivity (NPP) is predicted to increase under most GCM scenarios over most of the globe. Carbon fluxes to the atmosphere due to fire generally increase too across the globe. Such responses of NPP and fire occurrence result from the synergistic effects of CO2 concentration changes, climate changes, and vegetation changes. A companion paper (in preparation) will examine how the biosphere response documented here influences the impact of climate change on surface hydrological conditions.

The resulting signal resembles the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and is presumably associated with intrinsic dynamics of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). While certain phases of the oscillation are dominated by the anomalies in the North Atlantic region, other phases are characterized by global teleconnections to the North Pacific Ocean, Tropical Atlantic Ocean, as well as to the Southern Ocean. In particular, natural variability of sea-surface temperature in the Atlantic hurricanes’ main development region has a peak-to-peak amplitude comparable in magnitude to this region’s surface temperature increase over the past century, for all seasons. Evidence suggests that the AMO influence on secular trends in the global-mean surface temperature can arise via direct, regional, contribution to the surface temperature evolution, as well as via indirect route linked to variability of the oceanic uptake of CO2 associated with AMO-related THC changes.','accepted','Journal of Climate','2007','','','','http://www.uwm.edu/~kravtsov/downloads/GTINTERCOMP.pdf','2007-02-28 12:23:15','2007-05-07 12:26:20','sergey','sergey',1),(255,14,'Cassano, J.J., P.

The method of self-organizing maps was used to create the synoptic climatology from three decades of model output; 1991-2000, 2046-2055, and 2091-2100. The model derived synoptic climatology was compared to that from the two reanalyses, for the period 1991-2000, and this comparison was used to select a subset of models which best reproduced the currently observed synoptic climate of the Arctic. Of the fifteen models evaluated in this way only 4 models were able to reproduce the key features of the Arctic synoptic climate as depicted by the two global reanalyses. The synoptic climatology created using the self-organizing map technique lends itself to the study of extreme events and the projections from this subset of 4 models indicate an increase in cyclonically dominated weather patterns over the 21st century. The models also projected an increase in net precipitation over the Arctic cap and the large Arctic river watersheds during the 21st century. Using the synoptic climatology, a method to assess thermodynamic and circulation related changes in net precipitation was derived. The results of this assessment indicate that thermodynamic changes are responsible for more than 75% of the predicted change in Arctic net precipitation during the 21st century.

While the various observational sources used for validation contain differences among themselves, some model biases and across-model differences emerge. For all energy budget components in the twentieth-century simulations (the 20C3M simulation), the across-model variance and the differences from observational estimates are largest in the marginal ice zone (Barents, Kara, Chukchi Seas). Both downward and upward longwave radiation at the surface are underestimated in winter by many models, and the ensenmble mean annual net surface energy loss by longwave radiation is 35 W/m2, which is less than for the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses but in line with some of the satellite estimates. Incoming solar radiation is overestimated by the models in spring and underestimated in summer and autumn. The ensemble mean annual net surface energy gain by shortwave radiation is 39 W/m2, which is slightly less than for the observational based estimates, In the twentyfirst-century simulations driven by the SRES A2 scenario, increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase (average for 2080&#8211;2100 minus average for 1980&#8211;2000 averages) the annual average ensemble mean downward longwave radiation by 30.1 W/m2. This was partly counteracted by a 10.7 W/m2 reduction in downward shortwave radiation. Enhanced sea ice melt and increased surface temperatures increase the annual surface upward longwave radiation by 27.1 W/m2 and reduce the upward shortwave radiation by 13.2 W/m2, giving an annual net (shortwave plus longwave) surface radiation increase of 5.8 W/m2 , with the maximum changes in summer. The increase in net surface radiation is largely offset by an increased energy loss of 4.4 W/m2 by the turbulent fluxes.','published','Climate Dynamics','2007','','','10.1007/s00382-006-0222-9','','2007-03-02 00:01:53','2007-03-02 00:01:53','kattsov','kattsov',1),(258,467,'Wang M., J.E.

Reproducing this decadal and longer variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, with considerable variability in amplitude among models. In contrast only eight models generated warm anomaly amplitude at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization, but not its timing. The durations of the mid-century warm events in all the models are decadal, while that of the observed was interdecadal. The variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations.  The random timing of mid-century warm anomalies in 20C3M simulations and the similar variance of the control runs in about half of the models suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability. Five models were considered to compare somewhat favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance of the observed temperature record in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly amplitude in their 20C3M simulations. Seven additional models could be given further consideration.

Here we analyze multi-model ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience 1) high magnitudes of local climate change, 2) development of novel 21st-century climates, and/or 3) disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical montane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39% and 10-48% of the earth’s terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20% and 4-20%. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates. There is a close correspondence between regions with globally disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots; for these regions, standard conservation solutions (e.g. assisted migration, networked reserves) may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity.','in_press','Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences','2007','','','','','2007-03-13 09:45:24','2007-03-13 09:47:28','jwilliams','jwilliams',1),(269,175,'Williams, J.

The well-documented no-analog plant communities in late-glacial North America are closely linked to ‘novel’ climates also lacking modern analogs, characterized by high temperature seasonality.  In climate simulations for the IPCC A2 and B1 emission scenarios, novel climates arise by 2100AD, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.  These future novel climates are warmer than any present climates globally, with spatially variable shifts in precipitation.  These novel climates increase the risk of species reshuffling into future no-analog communities and other ecological surprises.  Most ecological models are at least partially parameterized from modern observations and so may fail to accurately predict ecological responses to these novel climates.

Communities may have a window of opportunity to prepare, but information to support adaptation programs is sparse. For a small city’s watershed, the present culvert system’s capacity for conveying expected peak flow, Qp, resulting from climate change and full build-out was assessed. Least squares regression was used to transfer, to the study site, expected increases to point process location, scale, and regionalized shape parameters for 6 grid points from the GFDL CM-2.1 GCM. Runoff rates and Qp were modeled by the NRCS TR-55 curve number method and HEC-22. Standard civil engineering methods were used to reverse-engineer existing culverts, and replacement costs were estimated using national construction cost estimators. The mid-21st century 25-year precipitation is estimated to be 19% greater than the historical 25-year precipitation. This rate is similar to the 15% rule of thumb proposed by previous research. 43% of culverts likely will be undersized as a result of climate change and population growth, placing people and property at risk. A long-term upgrade program, utilizing existing strategies to manage uncertainty and costs, may maintain historically acceptable risk levels. The scientific, professional, and political communities remain concerned about the significant uncertainy that has not been eliminated from either GCM output or downscaling. However, numerous developments including scientific advancements, uncertainty management techniques, and increasing manifestation of climate change impacts, obviates the prudence of a \"wait-and-see\" strategy. This study proposes that current GCM output and statistical methods can generate reliable and specific estimates of impacts from climate change, in support of programs to adapt civil infrastructures.','submitted','Climatic Change','','','','','','2007-03-15 21:19:17','2007-03-16 10:43:36','lstackms','lstackms',1),(271,89,'Dairaku, K., and S.

We assess whether observed streamflow timing changes can be statistically attributed to external forcing, or whether they still lie within the bounds of natural (internal) variability for four large Sierra Nevada (CA) basins, at inflow points to major reservoirs. Streamflow timing is measured by ‘‘center timing’’ (CT), the day when half the annual flow has passed a given point. We use a physically based hydrology model driven by meteorological input from a global climate model to quantify the natural variability in CT trends. Estimated\r\n50-year trends in CT due to natural climate variability often exceed estimated actual CT trends from 1950 to 1999. Thus, although observed trends in CT to date may be statistically significant, they cannot yet be statistically attributed to external influences on climate. We estimate that projected CT changes at the four major reservoir inflows will, with 90% confidence, exceed those from natural variability within 1–4 decades or 4–8 decades, depending on rates of future greenhouse gas emissions. To identify areas most likely to exhibit CT changes in response to rising temperatures, we calculate changes in CT under temperature increases from 1 to 5. We find that areas with  average winter temperatures between 2C and 4C are most likely to respond with\r\nsignificant CT shifts. Correspondingly, elevations from 2000 to 2800 m are most sensitive to temperature increases, with CT changes exceeding 45 days (earlier) relative to 1961–1990.','published','J.

A way of observationally constrained prediction is provided by training multi-model simulations for the second half of the twentieth century with respect to long-term components. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) produces weighted probability density functions (PDFs) and we compare two methods of estimating weighting factors: Bayes factor and expectation–maximization algorithm. It is shown that Bayesian-weighted PDFs for the global mean SAT changes are characterized by multi-modal structures from the middle of the twenty-first century onward, which are not clearly seen in arithmetic ensemble mean (AEM). This occurs because BMA tends to select a few high-skilled models and down-weight the others. Additionally, Bayesian results exhibit larger means and broader PDFs in the global mean predictions than the unweighted AEM. Multi-modality is more pronounced in the continental analysis using 30-year mean (2070–2099) SATs while there is only a little effect of Bayesian weighting on the 5–95% range. These results indicate that this approach to observationally constrained probabilistic predictions can be highly sensitive to the method of training, particularly for the later half of the twenty-first century, and that a more comprehensive approach combining different regions and/or variables is required.\r\n\r\nKeywords: global climate change; Bayesian model averaging; probabilistic prediction; surface air temperature','published','Phil.

Using simulations of 20th century climate performed with 13 numerical models, we demonstrate that the apparent discrepancy between modeled and observed variability is largely explained by accounting for changes in observational coverage and instrumentation and by including the effects of volcanic eruptions.

Williams','Hurricanes and global warming:  Results from downscaling IPCC AR4 simulations','  Changes in tropical cyclone activity are among the more potentially consequential results of global climate change, and it is therefore of considerable interest to understand how anthropogenic climate change may affect such storms. Global climate models are currently used to estimate future climate change, but the current generation of models lacks the horizontal resolution necessary to resolve the intense inner core of tropical cyclones. Here we review a new technique for inferring  tropical cyclone climatology from the output of global models, extend it to predict genesis climatologies (rather than relying on historical climatology), and apply it to current and future climate states simulated by a suite of global models developed in support of the most recent IPCC report.  This new technique solves the horizontal resolution problem by using a specialized, coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane model phrased in angular momentum coordinates, which provide high resolution of the core at low cost. This model is run along each of two thousand storm tracks generated using an advection-and-beta model, which is in turn driven by large-scale winds derived from the global models. In an extension to this method, tracks are initiated by randomly seeding large areas of the tropics with weak vortices and then allowing the intensity model to determine their survival, based on large-scale environmental conditions. We show that this method is largely successful in reproducing the observed spatial distribution,  seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of tropical cyclones in the present climate. When applied to simulations of global climate with double the present concentration of carbon dioxide, this method predicts substantial changes and geographic shifts in tropical cyclone activity, but with much variation among the global climate models used.  Changes in basin-wide power dissipation vary greatly from model to model and from basin to basin, but in general, storm frequency decreases and the frequency of landfall events declines nearly everywhere.  We demonstrate that in these simulations, the decrease in tropical cyclone activity is caused by the increasing difference between the moist entropy of the boundary layer and that of the middle troposphere as the climate warms. \r\n','in_press','Bull.

Along the equator, in contrast, in boreal spring CCSM3 exhibits striking westerly winds with easterly winds in the upper troposphere, in turn reminiscent of the observed pattern of climate variability in boreal summer. The westerly winds cause a deepening of the eastern thermocline that keeps the east warm despite enhanced coastal upwelling. Thus, the bias in the seasonal cycle of the coupled model appears to project at least partially onto the spatial patterns of natural climate variability in this sector.\r\n\r\nInformation about the origin of the bias in CCSM3 is deduced from a comparison of CCSM3 with a simulation using specified historical SST to force the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3). The patterns of bias in CAM3 resemble those apparent in CCSM3, including the appearance of substantially intensified subtropical bands of sea level pressure (SLP), indicating that the problem may be traced to difficulties in the atmospheric component model. Positive SLP bias also appears in the western tropical region, which may be related to deficient Amazonian precipitation. The positive SLP bias seems to be the cause of the anomalous westerly trade winds in boreal spring, and those in turn appear to be responsible for the anomalous deepening of the thermocline in the southeastern Tropics.\r\n','published','J.

The integrations were made available by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison for the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The evaluation emphasizes the circulation characteristics that support the precipitation climatology, and the physical processes of a “rainfall dipole” variability mode that is often associated with dry conditions in the Sahel when SSTs in the Gulf of Guinea are anomalously warm.\r\nBased on the quality of their 20th century simulations over West Africa in summer, three GCMs are chosen for analysis of the 21st century integrations under various assumptions about future greenhouse gas increases. Each of these models behaves differently in the 21st century simulations. One model simulates severe drying across the Sahel in the later part of the 21st century, while another projects quite wet conditions throughout the 21st century. In the third model, warming in the Gulf of Guinea leads to more modest drying in the Sahel due to a doubling of the number of anomalously dry years by the end of the century. An evaluation of the physical processes that cause these climate changes, in the context of our understanding about how the system works in the 20th century, suggests that the third model is providing the most reasonable projection of 21st century climate.','published','J.

The model used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation statistics of July–June-averaged SST from the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset for the years 1900–2002. The model accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data, including interannual and interdecadal spectral peaks that are significant relative to univariate red noise. Eigenanalysis of the linear dynamical operator yields propagating eigenmodes that correspond to these peaks but have very short decay times and, thus, limited predictability.\r\n\r\nLonger-term predictability does exist, however, due to two stationary eigenmodes that are more weakly damped. These eigenmodes do not strongly correspond to the canonical ENSO and PDO patterns. Instead, one is similar to the 1900–2002 trend and might represent anthropogenic effects, while the second represents multidecadal fluctuations of a pattern that potentially represents natural decadal variability; however, neither attribution can be made unambiguously with the analysis presented in this paper. Predictability of these two stationary eigenmodes is significantly enhanced by tropical–North Pacific coupling. Neither stationary eigenmode is well captured in the control run of any coupled GCM in the CMIP-3 project of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), perhaps because in all of the GCMs tropical SST decadal variability is too weak and North Pacific SSTs are too independent of the Tropics.\r\n\r\nA key implication of this analysis is that the PDO may represent not a single physical mode but rather the sum of several phenomena, each of which represents a different red noise with its own autocorrelation time scale and spatial pattern. The sum of these red noises can give rise to apparent PDO “regime shifts” and seeming characteristics of a long memory process. Such shifts are not predictable beyond the time scale of the most rapidly decorrelating noise, less than two years, although the expected duration of regimes may be determined from the relative amplitudes of different eigenmodes.','published','J.

Köberle','Comparison of Arctic sea ice thickness variability in IPCC Climate of the 20th Century experiments and in ocean–sea ice hindcasts','Arctic sea ice is an important climate component and often regarded as an early indicator of anthropogenic global change. For an assessment of coupled climate models, their performance with respect to the development of Arctic sea ice thickness during the 20th century is examined. Their behavior is compared with results from an ocean–sea ice model using the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP) atmospheric forcing for the period 1948–2000. In lieu of actually observed sea ice thickness, this model result under realistic atmospheric forcing serves as a benchmark for the coupled climate models. The hindcast exhibits virtually no trend in Arctic ice volume over its integration period 1948–2000. Most of the coupled climate models show a negative trend over the 20th century that accelerates towards the end of that century.','published','J.Geophys.Res','2007','112','','doi:10.1029/2006JC003616.','','2007-07-26 01:18:24','2007-07-26 01:18:24','rgerdes','rgerdes',1),(290,654,'Knopf, B.','On Intrinsic Uncertainties in Earth System Modelling','Uncertainties are pervasive in the Earth System modelling. This is not just due to a lack of knowledge about physical processes but has its seeds in intrinsic, i.e. inevitable and irreducible, uncertainties concerning the process of modelling as well. Therefore, it is indispensable to quantify uncertainty in order to determine, which are robust results under this inherent uncertainty. The central goal of this thesis is to explore how uncertainties map on the properties of interest such as phase space topology and qualitative dynamics of the system. We will address several types of uncertainty and apply methods of dynamical systems theory on a trendsetting field of climate research, i.e. the Indian monsoon.\r\n\r\nWith a monsoon model the uncertainty about the external influence of El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is determined. There is evidence that ENSO influences the variability of the Indian monsoon, but the underlying physical mechanism is discussed controversially. As a contribution to the debate three different hypotheses are tested of how ENSO and the Indian summer monsoon are linked. In this thesis the coupling through the trade winds is identified as key in linking these two key climate constituents. On the basis of this physical mechanism the observed monsoon rainfall data can be reproduced to a great extent.

The scenario values are constructed by combining output from an ensemble of recent General Climate Model (GCM) simulations, Regional Climate Model (RCM) output, meteorological observations and a touch of expert judgment. For temperature, precipitation, potential evaporation and wind four scenarios are constructed, encompassing ranges of both global mean temperature rise in 2050 and the strength of the response of the dominant atmospheric circulation in the area of interest to global warming. For this particular area, wintertime precipitation is seen to increase between 3,5 and 7% per degree global warming, but mean summertime precipitation shows opposite signs depending on the assumed response of the circulation regime. Annual maximum daily mean wind speed shows small changes compared to the observed (natural) variability of this variable. Sea level rise in the North Sea in 2100 ranges between 35 and 85 cm. Preliminary assessment of the impact of the new scenarios on water management and coastal defence policies indicate that particularly dry summer scenarios and increased intensity of extreme daily precipitation deserves additional attention in the near future.','published','Water Science and Technology','2007','4','27-33','','','2007-07-26 05:02:50','2007-11-27 00:44:36','oldenborgh','oldenborgh',1),(293,177,'Sterl, A., G.J. van Oldenborgh, W.

We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. The models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all future scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4-6 month duration) droughts from the mid 20th century to the end of the 21st. Long-term (more than 12 month duration) droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long term frequencies as do mid latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from natural variability for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the 21st century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means.','submitted','Climate Dynamics','2007','','','','','2007-07-26 07:18:05','2007-07-26 07:18:23','sheffield','sheffield',1),(297,667,'Lobell, D.B., C.

Here we compare the expected cooling associated with rates of irrigation expansion in developing countries for historical (1961-2000) and future (2000-2030) periods with climate model predictions of temperature changes from other forcings, most notably increased atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, over the same periods. Indirect effects of irrigation on climate, via methane production in paddy rice systems, were not considered. In regions of rapid irrigation growth over the past 40 years, such as Northwest India and Northeast China, irrigation’s expected cooling effects have been similar in magnitude to climate model predictions of warming from greenhouse gases. A masking effect of irrigation can therefore explain the lack of significant increases in observed growing season maximum temperatures in these regions and the apparent discrepancy between observations and climate model simulations. Projections of irrigation for 2000-2030 indicate a slowing of expansion rates, and therefore cooling from irrigation expansion over this time period will very likely be smaller than in recent decades. At the same time, warming from greenhouse gases will likely accelerate, and irrigation will play a relatively smaller role in agricultural climate trends. In many irrigated regions, therefore, temperature projections from climate models, which generally ignore irrigation, may be more accurate in predicting future temperature trends than their performance in reproducing past observed trends would suggest.','submitted','Geophysical Research Letters','2007','','','','','2007-07-26 08:28:27','2007-07-26 08:28:27','dlobell','dlobell',1),(298,667,'Lobell, D.B.','Changes in diurnal temperature range and national cereal yields','Models of yield responses to temperature change have often considered only changes in average temperature (Tavg), with the implicit assumption that changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR; the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperature) can safely be ignored. The goal of this study was to evaluate this assumption using a combination of historical datasets and climate model projections. Data on national crop yields for 1961-2002 in the 10 leading producers of wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), and maize (Zea mays) were combined with datasets on climate and crop locations to evaluate the empirical relationships between Tavg, DTR, and crop yields. In several rice and maize growing regions, including the two major nations for each crop, there was a clear negative response of yields to increased DTR. This finding reflects a nonlinear response of yields to temperature, which likely results from greater water and heat stress during hot days. In many other cases, the effects of DTR were not statistically significant, in part because correlations of DTR with other climate variables and the relatively short length of the time series resulted in wide confidence intervals for the estimates.\r\n	To evaluate whether future changes in DTR are relevant to crop impact assessments, yield responses to projected changes in Tavg and DTR by 2046-2065 from 11 climate models were estimated. The mean of climate model projections indicated an increase in DTR in most seasons and locations where wheat is grown, mixed projections for maize, and a general decrease in DTR for rice. These mean projections were associated with wide ranges that included zero in nearly all cases. The estimated impacts of DTR changes on yields were generally small (<5% change in yields) relative to the consistently negative impact of projected warming of Tavg. However, DTR changes did significantly affect yield responses in several cases, such as in reducing US maize yields and increasing India rice yields. Because DTR projections tend to be positively correlated with Tavg, estimates of yield changes for extreme warming were particularly affected by including DTR (up to 10%). Finally, based on the relatively poor performance of climate models in reproducing the magnitude of past DTR trends, it is possible that future DTR changes and associated yield responses will exceed the ranges considered here.\r\n','in_press','Agricultural and Forest Meteorology','2007','','','','','2007-07-26 08:29:33','2007-07-26 08:29:33','dlobell','dlobell',1),(299,148,'Schneider, B., M.

Southerly wind blows across the equator toward this atmospheric heating. Southerlies are minimal during boreal spring, when two\r\nprecipitation maxima straddle the equator. The climate of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere is analyzed in 15 coupled ocean-atmosphere models from 8 nations. Coupled models variously reproduce the observed meridional march with the seasons of sea surface temperature (SST) and intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) precipitation. Most models have too much rain in the southern hemisphere so that rain is nearly symmetric about the equator in the annual mean. In 8 out of 15 models the ITCZ alternates symmetrically between the hemispheres with the seasons. Simple metrics are introduced to diagnose model fidelity.\r\n\r\nSpread of the various solutions from the multi-model ensemble elucidates coupled\r\nphysics. The seasonally alternating ITCZ error generates two wind speed maxima per year, one northerly and one southerly, resulting in a semiannual cycle of equatorial SST and a cool bias of the equatorial ocean. A spurious cooling occurs in March on the equator in some models. March cold tongue temperature among the models is correlated to the scalar speed of cross-equatorial wind at –0.6. Models tend to simulate too weak a meridional asymmetry. Weaker than observed meridional wind within 1000 km of the South American coast explains a warm SST error. SST on the equator (80-90º W, 2º S-2º N) is correlated to meridional wind speed at –0.66 among models.\r\n\r\nNortheasterly wind jets blow over the Central American isthmus in winter and\r\ncool the SST in the eastern Pacific warm pool. In some models the strength of these winds contributes to the early demise of their northern ITCZ relative to observations. The February-April northerly wind bias on the equator is correlated to the antecedent December-February Central American Pacific wind speed at –0.87, suggesting an atmospheric connection between the Central American northeasterlies and the southward shift of the ITCZ.\r\n\r\nThe various representations of stratus clouds among models clearly affect the\r\nunderlying SST, but their effect on the meridional atmospheric circulation is difficult to discern from the multi-model ensemble. This study identifies several features to be improved in atmospheric and coupled GCMs, including the northeasterly cross-Central American wind in winter and the meridional wind on the equator. It suggests that both the double ITCZ error and equatorial SST errors in the eastern Pacific could be alleviated by reducing errors in the climatology of meridional wind.','accepted','J.

In contrast\r\nto the strengthening and contraction of the Hadley cell and the equatorward shift of the\r\ntropospheric zonal jets in response to El Nino, the Hadley cell weakens and expands poleward, and\r\nthe jets move poleward under a warmed climate, despite the ~SEl Nino-like~T enhanced warming over\r\nequatorial central and eastern Pacific.\r\nTwo feasible mechanisms are proposed for the zonal mean circulation response to global warming:\r\n(1) The increase in static stability of the subtropical and mid-latitude troposphere, a result of\r\nthe quasi-moist adiabatic adjustment to the surface warming, tends to stabilize the eddy growth\r\non the equatorward side of the storm track and push the eddy activity and the associated\r\neddy-driven wind and subsidence poleward, leading to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell\r\nand the shift of jet; (2) the strengthening of the mid-latitude wind at the upper-troposphere and\r\nlower-stratosphere, arguably a consequence of the rise in the height of the tropopause and the\r\nassociated increase in the meridional temperature gradient, can increase the phase speed of the\r\neddies emanating from the mid-latitudes, and thus the critical latitudes (where the eddy phase\r\nspeed matches the background zonal wind, and where the eddies break and extract angular momentum\r\nfrom the thermally driven wind) displace poleward and carry the eddy-driven circulation with it.\r\nBoth mechanisms are somewhat, if not completely, distinct from those in response to the El Nino\r\ncondition. The hydrological impacts of global warming also exhibit distinct patterns over the\r\nsubtropics and mid-latitudes in comparison to the El Nino.\r\nSince both mechanisms do not essentially depend on the details of the SST warming in the\r\nequatorial oceans and the variety of model physical parameterizations, these extratropical\r\nresponses to global warming may be of increased credence due to the fact that they are\r\ndynamically determined.','submitted','J.

However, equilibrium ice thickness is an extremely sensitive function of the ice albedo, allowing errors in simulated cloud cover to be compensated by tuning of the ice albedo. This analysis suggests that the results of current GCMs cannot be relied upon at face value for credible predictions of future Arctic sea ice.','published','Geophysical Research Letters','2007','34','L10501','10.1029/2007GL029914','','2007-07-26 09:25:47','2007-07-26 09:26:03','eisenman','eisenman',1),(303,518,'Holland, M.M., C.M.

The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing.

Moreover, there is indication of change in the tails of the seasonal precipitation distributions over the savanna for the scenario with 2xCO2, comparatively to the present climate. This suggests changes in the probability of extremes (dry or wet) events over that region in a scenario with 2xCO2, which indicates according to MIROC the large exposure of the region to possible consequences of climate changes resulting from increasing greenhouse gases.','accepted','Rev.

In climate change experiments that simulate greenhouse gas-induced warming. Southern Ocean air-sea heat fluxes and three-dimensional circulation patterns make it a region where much of the future oceanic heat storage takes place, though the magnitude of that heat storage is one of the larger sources of uncertainty associated with the transient climate response in such model projections. Factors such as the Southern Ocean\'s wind forcing, heat, and salt budgets are linked to the structure and transport of the ACC in ways that have not been expresed clearly in the literature. These links are explored here in a coupled model context by analyzing a sizable suite of preindustrial control experiments associated with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Fourth Assessment Report. A framework is developed that uses measures of coupled model simulation characteristics, primarily those related to the Southern Ocean wind forcing and water mass properties, to allow one to categorize, and to some extent predict, which models do better or worse at simulating the Southern Ocean and why.

The Mk3 model has been in development and used for production climate runs for the best part of a decade and is the end result of a significant commitment of financial and intellectual resources from a relatively small group of developers and stakeholders.\r\nThe task of processing, deriving, validating and submitting Mk3 output provided significant computing and logistic challenges. Data requirements were substantially more demanding than ever before and the schedule for inclusion in the AR4 database was extremely tight. Particularly when several key model experiments were still underway when the call for data (from JSC/CLIVAR WGCM) came. However, the importance of contributing to the IPCC AR4 with a climate model developed in the Southern Hemisphere cannot be underestimated. This effort will provide a useful “model development” yardstick for the ACCESS  climate model development program that is underway in Australia. The best indicator of the Mk3 outcome is the inclusion of its performance in hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles and the many contractual reports completed and underway.\r\nWe briefly described the system for managing Mk3 model output based on a modern, locally developed, scripting computer language for the efficient processing of large and complex datasets. This system takes into account different Mk3 model configurations and model output inconsistencies and is able to generate a temporally, spatially and physically consistent set of data products. An essential feature is the ability to make the model results self describing (CF-compliant netCDF files) to enable efficient uptake by researchers. Experiences with data validation and quality control checking is described, an often overlooked aspect of data delivery. Our goal was to make the Mk3 model output easily accessible its to the international climate research community.\r\nIn this presentation a brief history of the development and features of the CSIRO Mk3 model will be provided. The Mk3.5 version of the climate model includes many improvements over its predecessor resulting in a control climate with a relatively small drift.  This new and updated archive of model outputs will provide the local and international community with a wealth of informative and sophisticated climate model experiments for completion of important institutional studies.

There are a variety of issues that complicate the analysis\r\nof radiative feedbacks in global climate models (GCMs), resulting in some confusion regarding\r\ntheir strength and distribution. In this paper, we present a method for quantifying climate\r\nfeedbacks based on “radiative kernels” which describe the differential response of the top-ofatmosphere\r\nradiative fluxes to incremental changes in the feedback variables. The use of\r\nradiative kernels enables one to decompose the feedback into one part that depends on the\r\nradiative transfer algorithm and the unperturbed climate state, and a second part that arises\r\nfrom the climate response of the feedback variables. Such decomposition facilitates an\r\nunderstanding of the spatial characteristics of the feedbacks and the causes of intermodel\r\ndifferences. This technique has the advantage of requiring fewer computations and being easier\r\nto implement than “partial radiative perturbation” methods. More importantly, it provides a\r\nsimple and accurate way to compare feedbacks across different models using a consistent\r\nmethodology. Cloud feedbacks cannot be evaluated directly from a cloud radiative kernel\r\nbecause of strong nonlinearities, but they can be estimated from the change in cloud forcing and\r\nthe difference between the full-sky and clear-sky kernels.

Although the simulated warming makes snow season to shorten from its both ends in all of Eurasia and North America, SWE at the height of the winter generally increases in the coldest areas. Elsewhere, snow decreases throughout the winter. The average borderline between increasing and decreasing midwinter SWE coincides broadly with the &#8722;20°C isotherm in late 20th century November–March mean temperature, although with some variability between different areas. On the colder side of this isotherm, an increase in total precipitation generally dominates over reduced fraction of solid precipitation and more efficient melting, and SWE therefore increases. On the warmer side, where the phase of winter precipitation and snowmelt are more sensitive to the simulated warming, the reverse happens. The strong temperature dependence of the simulated SWE changes suggests that projections of SWE change could be potentially improved by taking into account biases in simulated present-day winter temperatures.

For the mid-Holocene (MH, 6,000 years ago), the models are forced by changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters. The MH PMIP1 atmosphere-only simulations conducted with sea surface temperatures fixed to modern conditions show no MH consistent response for the poles, whereas the new PMIP2 coupled atmosphere– ocean climate models systematically simulate a significant MH warming both for Greenland (but smaller than ice-core based estimates) and Antarctica (consistent with the range of ice-core based range). In both PMIP1 and PMIP2, the MH annual mean changes in global temperature are negligible, consistent with the MH orbital forcing. The simulated last glacial maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) to pre-industrial change in global mean temperature ranges between 3 and 7degC in PMIP1 and PMIP2 model runs, similar to the range of temperature change expected from a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the CMIP simulations. Both LGM and future climate simulations are associated with a polar amplification of climate change. The range of glacial polar amplification in Greenland is strongly dependent on the ice sheet elevation changes prescribed to the climate models. All PMIP2 simulations systematically underestimate the reconstructed glacial–interglacial Greenland temperature change, while some of the simulations do capture the reconstructed glacial–interglacial Antarctic temperature change. Uncertainties in the prescribed central ice cap elevation cannot account for the temperature change underestimation by climate models. The variety of climate model sensitivities enables the exploration of the relative changes in polar temperature with respect to changes in global temperatures. Simulated changes of polar temperatures are strongly related to changes in simulated global temperatures for both future and LGM climates, confirming that ice-core-based reconstructions provide quantitative insights on global climate changes.','published','Climate Dynamics','2006','26','513–529','10.1007/s00382-005-0081-9','http://www.springerlink.com/content/y03u1822p657l420/?p=b1144beff5814cb9a23745d87428f337&pi=4','2007-08-07 09:19:25','2007-08-07 09:21:26','masakageyama','masakageyama',1),(325,501,'V.

Tuenter','Past temperature reconstructions from deep ice cores: relevance for future climate change','Ice cores provide unique archives of past climate and environmental changes based only on physical processes. Quantitative temperature reconstructions are essential for the comparison between ice core records and climate models. We give an overview of the methods that have been developed to reconstruct past local temperatures from deep ice cores and highlight several points that are relevant for future climate change.\r\nWe first analyse the long term fluctuations of temperature as depicted in the long Antarctic record from EPICA Dome C. The long term imprint of obliquity changes in the EPICA Dome C record is highlighted and compared to simulations conducted with the ECBILT-CLIO intermediate complexity climate model. We discuss the comparison between the current interglacial period and the long interglacial corresponding to marine isotopic stage 11, ca. 400 kyr BP. Previous studies had focused on the role of precession and the thresholds required to induce glacial inceptions. We suggest that, due to the low eccentricity configuration of MIS 11 and the Holocene, the effect of precession on the incoming solar radiation is damped and that changes in obliquity must be taken into account. The EPICA Dome C alignment of terminations I and VI published in 2004 corresponds to a phasing of the obliquity signals. A conjunction of low obliquity and minimum northern hemisphere summer insolation is not found in the next tens of thousand years, supporting the idea of an unusually long interglacial ahead.\r\nAs a second point relevant for future climate change, we discuss the magnitude and rate of change of past temperatures reconstructed from Greenland (NorthGRIP) and Antarctic (Dome C) ice cores. Past episodes of temperatures above the present-day values by up to 5degC are recorded at both locations during the penultimate interglacial period. The rate of polar warming simulated by coupled climate models forced by a CO2 increase of 1% per year is compared to ice-core-based temperature reconstructions. In Antarctica, the CO2-induced warming lies clearly beyond the natural rhythm of temperature fluctuations. In Greenland, the CO2-induced warming is as fast or faster than the most rapid temperature shifts of the last ice age. The magnitude of polar temperature change in response to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 is comparable to the magnitude of the polar temperature change from the Last Glacial Maximum to present-day. When forced by prescribed changes in ice sheet reconstructions and CO2 changes, climate models systematically underestimate the glacial-interglacial polar temperature change.','published','Climate of the Past','2006','2','145–165','','http://www.clim-past.net/2/145/2006/','2007-08-07 09:31:07','2007-08-07 09:31:07','masakageyama','masakageyama',1),(326,194,'Kattsov, V.M., J.

The present paper synthesizes the new simulations of both the 20th- and 21st-century arctic freshwater budget components for use in the IPCC AR4, and attempts to determine whether demonstrable progress has been achieved since the late 1990s. Precipitation and its difference with evapotranspiration are addressed over the Arctic Ocean and its terrestrial watersheds, including the basins of the four major rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean: the Ob, the Yenisey, the Lena, and the Mackenzie. Compared to the previous (IPCC Third Assessment Report, TAR) generation of AOGCMs, there are some indications that the models as a class have improved in simulations of the arctic precipitation. In spite of observational uncertainties, the models still appear to oversimulate area-averaged precipitation over the major river basins. The model-mean precipitation biases in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have retained their major geographical patterns, which are at least partly attributable to the insufficiently resolved local orography, as well as to biases in large scale atmospheric circulation and sea-ice distribution. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean is also slightly oversimulated. The simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean is in qualitative agreement between the models as well as with observational and reanalysis data. This is also generally the case for the seasonality of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean’s terrestrial watersheds, with a few exceptions. Some agreement is demonstrated by the models in reproducing positive 20th century trends of precipitation in the Arctic, as well as positive area-averaged P-E late-20th century trends over the entire terrestrial watershed of the Arctic Ocean.\r\nFor the 21st century, three scenarios are considered: A2, A1B, and B1. Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and its watersheds increases through the 21st century, showing much faster percentage increases than the global mean precipitation. The arctic precipitation changes have a pronounced seasonality, with the strongest relative increase in winter and fall, and the weakest in summer. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean increases for all scenarios from all major river basins considered, and is generally about twice as large as the increase of freshwater from precipitation over the Arctic Ocean (70-90°N) itself. The across-model scatter of the precipitation increase for each scenario is significant, but smaller than the scatter between the climates of the different models in the baseline period.','published','J.

Reproducing this decadal and longer variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, with considerable variability in amplitude among models. In contrast only eight models generated warm anomaly amplitude at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization, but not its timing. The durations of the mid-century warm events in all the models are decadal, while that of the observed was interdecadal. The variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations. The random timing of mid-century warm anomalies in 20C3M simulations and the similar variance of the control runs in about half of the models suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability. Five models were considered to compare somewhat favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance of the observed temperature record in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly amplitude in their 20C3M simulations. Seven additional models could be given further consideration.

These two \r\ncomponents can reproduce the spatial structure of local linear trends over various multi-decadal \r\nperiods, indicating that they give an efficient representation of the observed change in surface \r\ntemperature.  In contrast, most simulations suggest the existence of a single physically significant \r\nOPP, all with qualitatively similar time series but each with somewhat different spatial structure. \r\nThe leading OPP computed from the full model grid, and from the observation based grid and \r\nmissing data masked out, are surprisingly consistent with each other, suggesting that the \r\nobservation-based grid does not pose a serious barrier to extracting the dominant low-frequency \r\nvariations in the global climate system.  The regions in which the leading optimal persistence \r\npatterns agree in their predictions of warming coincides with the regions in which warming has \r\nin fact been observed to occur.

The analysis is confined to the SST anomalies along the equatorial Pacific and is based on the use of a non-linear neural classification algorithm, the Self-Organizing Maps. Systematic biases include a larger than observed proportion for modelled ENSO maximum variability occurring in the Western Pacific. No clear relationship is found between this bias and the characteristics of the modelled mean state bias in the equatorial Pacific. This bias is mainly related to a misrepresentation of both El Niño and La Niña termination phases for most of the models. In contrast, the onset phase is quite well simulated. Modelled El Niño and La Niña peak phases display an asymmetric bias. Whereas the main bias of the modelled El Niño peak is to exhibit a maximum in the western Pacific, the simulated La Niña bias mainly occurs in the central Pacific. In addition, some models are able to capture the observed El Niño peak characteristics while none of them realistically simulate La Niña peaks. It also arises that the models closest to the observations score unevenly in reproducing the different phases, preventing an accurate classification of the models quality to reproduce the overall ENSO-like variability.','published','Clim.

Antarctica is the only continent entirely free from the combinations of fuels, weather conditions and ignition sources, which provide a potential wildfire hazard. Some regions such as California, Australia and the Mediterranean exhibit particular susceptibility to forest fires, and research throughout the 20th century established a strong correlation between meteorological variables and fire occurrence and extent. Since then, a number of fire-weather indices have been established which allow the seasonal and daily forecasting of fire hazards in these regions. The past decade has seen significant interest in the impact of anthropogenic climate forcing on the occurrence of forest fires, focused on the most fire-prone regions, predicting overall increases in fire-weather in Australia, Spain, Portugal and South-west U.S.A. An increase in fire-susceptibility has also been predicted for parts of the boreal forests of Canada and Russia. However, no global overview has been presented, and little interest is given to regions with a currently low fire danger, which may or may not experience an increase in forest fire occurrence in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study asks ‘can we expect a change in the global distribution of forest fires due to anthropogenic climate change?’ This question is of great significance due to the environmental, social and economic damage caused by forest fires. This damage may possibly be even greater in regions previously free of major fire hazards as they lack the management experience of current fire-prone regions. The increased occurrence of fire in forested regions not adapted to periodic fire seasons may also have significant ecological impact. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of a regional fire weather index to the global climate model. This study uses the ECHAM climate model data for the 4th IPCC Assessment along with the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) to compare the global distribution of forest fire weather in 2080 under a 2xCO2 climate with that of today. The model results are validated against observed forest fire data for the past 20 years. This validation enables the study to be evaluated as a model for predicting the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the global distribution of the forest fire hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValidation of the model suggests that it is useful as a predictive tool on a global scale, and also on a regional scale in Africa, China, Canada and Europe. For other regions alterations to the model are required to produce a more useful output. This study predicts a significant overall increase in global forest fire danger, with significant increases in Australia, Africa, South America, China, Canada and Europe.

In order to investigate the effect of this simplification in ASGCMs on ECS estimation, a climate feedback analysis was performed doubled CO2 equilibrium experiments (2XCO2) by ASGCM and 1% per year CO2 increase experiments (1%CO2) by atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs, in which physical processes in the ocean are considered explicitly). In some models, the strength of ice-albedo and cloud feedback in 2XCO2 is different from those in 1%CO2. The possible factors controlling these feedbacks in 1%CO2 seem more reliable than those \r\nin 2XCO2 because the ocean physical processes are accounted for appropriately in 1%CO2. If we assume the strength of ice-albedo and cloud feedback in 1%CO2 to be more accurate than that in 2XCO2, the ECS changes about 1 K in some models. In order to decrease the uncertainty in estimating ECS resulting from such artificial problems in the experimental settings of ASGCMs, it is important to make the initial sea ice distribution and the surface temperature response as realistic as possible.

In this approach, it is possible to directly observe the longwave feedbacks of the climate system in timeseries of annual average outgoing longwave spectra. Tropospheric temperature, stratospheric temperature, water vapor, and carbon dioxide have clear and distinctive signatures in the infrared spectrum, and it is possible to detect trends of these signals unambiguously from trends in the outgoing longwave spectrum by optimal detection techniques. We apply this approach to clear-sky data in the Tropics simulated from the output of an ensemble of climate models. Estimates of the water vapor-longwave feedback by this approach agree to within estimated errors with truth, and it is likely that an uncertainty of 50% can be obtained in twenty years of a continuous timeseries. The correlation of tropospheric temperature and water vapor anomalies can provide a constraint on the water vapor-longwave feedback to 5% uncertainty in twenty years, or 7% in ten years. Thus, it should be possible to place a strong constraint on climate models, which currently show a range of 30% in the water vapor-longwave feedback, in just ten years’ time. These results may not hold in the presence of clouds, however, and so it may be necessary to supplement timeseries of outgoing longwave spectra with GPS radio occultation data, which is insensitive to clouds.','accepted','J.

Observations of sea-ice thickness in the Southern Ocean are sparse and difficult to collect. An exception to this data gap is time-series data from upward-looking sonars (ULS) which sample the drifting sea ice continuously. In this study we use ULS data from ten different locations over periods ranging from 9 to 25 months to compare with model data. Although these data are limited in space and time, they provide a qualitative indication of the ability of global climate models (GCMs) to adequately represent Southern Ocean sea ice. We compare the ULS data to output from four different GCMs (BCCR-BCM2.0, ECHAM5/MPI-OM, UKMO-HadCM3 and NCAR CCSM3) which were used for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They simulate the ice thickness reasonably well, but in most cases average model ice thickness is less than thicknesses derived from ULS data. The seasonal cycle produced by the models correlates well with the ULS except for locations near Maud Rise, where in summer the ULS find a low concentration of thick ice floes. This overly thin ice will have implications for both the salt flux to the central Weddell Sea during the growth season and the freshwater flux during the melt season. Using satellite-derived ice-drift data to calculate transports in the Weddell Sea, we find that the underestimation of ice thickness results in underestimated salt fluxes.','published','Annals of Glaciology','2007','46','419-427','','http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/igsoc/agl/2007/00000046/00000001/art00062','2007-12-07 06:28:01','2007-12-07 06:28:01','angelika','angelika',1),(348,518,'Holland, M.M., J.

Increased freshwater inputs to the ocean from net precipitation, river runoff, and net ice\r\nmelt result. While generally attended by a larger export of liquid freshwater to lower latitudes, primarily through Fram Strait, liquid freshwater storage in the Arctic Ocean increases. In contrast, the export and storage of freshwater in the form of sea ice decreases. The qualitative agreement between models for which the only common forcing is rising greenhouse gas concentrations implicates this greenhouse gas loading as the cause of the change. Although the models perform quite well in their simulations of net precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and terrestrial drainage, they differ significantly regarding the magnitude of the trends and their representation of contemporary mean ocean and sea ice\r\nbudget terms.

Under conditions of warming and increasing precipitation which characterizes both observed and projected climate change over much of Northern Hemisphere land area with seasonal snow cover, the sensitivity analysis indicated snow cover duration (SCD) had the highest climate sensitivity with sensitivity varying with climate regime and elevation.  The largest SCD-climate sensitivity was associated with maritime climates with extensive winter snowfall (e.g. western cordillera of North America - NA).  Analysis of significant local changes in snow cover duration over the 1967-1998 period of NOAA data showed that significant decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of -5° to +2°C which extended around the coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models which showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) with the zone of earliest significant decreases located over the maritime margins of NA and Western Europe. The lowest SCD-climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relative cold, dry winters and short snow cover seasons where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing T and P in mountain regions due to non-linear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.','in_preparation','J.

The response of the global-mean troposphere temperature to increasing greenhouse gases is more likely linear, while the amplitude and period of ENSO fluctuates in a multi-decadal time scale. The climate system model outputs suggest that the multi-decadal modulation of ENSO is related to the delayed response of the subsurface temperature in the tropical Pacific compared to the response time of the sea surface temperature (SST), which would lead a modulation of the vertical temperature gradient. Furthermore, an eigen analysis considering only two parameters, the changes in the zonal contrast of the mean background SST and the changes in the vertical contrast between the mean surface and subsurface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, exhibits a good agreement with the CGCM outputs in terms of the multi-decadal modulations of the ENSO’s amplitude and period. In particular, the change in the vertical contrast, i.e., change in difference between the subsurface temperature and SST, turns out to be more influential on the ENSO modulation than changes in the mean SST itself.','published','J.

In this study, sixteen CGCM simulations of the response of the climate system to a 1\\% per year increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration to quadrupling are analysed with focus on Northern Hemisphere winter. A common signal in fourteen out of sixteen simulations is an increased or unchanged stationary wave amplitude.\r\n\r\nA majority of the simulations may be categorised into one of three groups based on the GHG induced changes in the atmospheric stationary waves. The response of the zonal mean barotropic wind is similar within each group. 50% of the simulations belong to the first group which is categorised by a stationary wave with five waves encompassing the whole NH and a strengthening of the zonal mean barotropic wind. The second and third group, consisting of three and two simulations respectively, are characterised by a broadening and a northward shift of the zonal mean barotropic wind respectively. A linear model of barotropic vorticity is employed to study the importance of these mean flow changes to the stationary wave response. The linear calculations indicate that the GHG induced mean wind changes explain 50%, 4% and 37% of the stationary wave changes in each group respectively. Thus, for the majority of simulations the zonal mean wind changes do significantly explain the stationary wave response.\r\n','submitted','J.

This complicates the fitting of simple models to such simulations, as well as having implications for the estimation of climate sensitivity from observations. This study examines the evolution of the feedbacks determining the climate sensitivity in GCMs submitted to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project.  Apparent centennial timescale variations of climate sensitivity during stabilisation to a forcing can be considered an artifact of using conventional forcings, allowing only for instantaneous effects and stratosphere-adjustment. If the forcing is adjusted for processes occurring on timescales which are short compared to the climate stabilisation timescale then there is little centennial timescale evolution of climate sensitivity in any of the GCMs.  We suggest that much of the apparent variation in climate sensitivity identified in previous studies is actually due to the comparatively fast forcing adjustment. Persistent differences are found in the strength of the feedbacks between the coupled atmosphere--ocean (AO) versions and their atmosphere-mixed-layer ocean (AML) counterparts, (the latter are often assumed to give the climate sensitivity of the AOGCM). This indicates that the response of the dynamic ocean influences the atmospheric feedbacks in some GCMs and that the AML model may not provide a good estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity for the parallel AO version. The adjustment to the forcing to account for comparatively fast processes varies in magnitude and sign between GCMs, as well as differing between AO and AML versions of the same model. There is evidence from one AOGCM that the forcing adjustment may take a couple of decades, with implications for observationally based estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity.  We suggest that at least some of the spread in 21st century global temperature predictions between GCMs is due to differing adjustment processes, hence work to understand these differences should be a priority.','submitted','J.

This experiment is used to investigate the main physical processes involved in the variability of the North Atlantic ocean convection and the induced variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). Three ocean convection sites are simulated, in the Labrador, Irminger and Greenland–Iceland–Norwegian (GIN) Seas in agreement with observations. A mechanism linking the variability of the Arctic sea ice cover and convection in the GIN Seas is highlighted. Contrary to previous suggested mechanisms, in CNRM-CM3 the latter is not modulated by the variability of freshwater export through Fram Strait. Instead, the variability of convection is mainly driven by the variability of the sea ice edge position in the Greenland Sea. In this area, the surface freshwater balance is dominated by the freshwater input due to the melting of sea ice. The ice edge position is modulated either by northwestward geostrophic current anomalies or by an intensification of northerly winds. In the model, stronger than average northerly winds force simultaneous intense convective events in the Irminger and GIN Seas. Convection interacts with the thermohaline circulation on timescales of 5–10 years, which translates into MOC anomalies propagating southward from the convection sites.','published','Clim.

The third version of the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques) global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model (CNRM-CM3) was used to conduct climate change experiments for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). The analysis of the A1B scenario experiment shows that global warming leads to a slowdown of North Atlantic deep ocean convection and thermohaline circulation south of Iceland. This slowdown is triggered by a freshening of the Arctic Ocean and an increase in freshwater outflow through Fram Strait. Sea ice melting in the Barents Sea induces a local amplification of the surface warming, which enhances the cyclonic atmospheric circulation around Spitzberg. This anti-clockwise circulation forces an increase in Fram Strait outflow and a simultaneous increase in ocean transport of warm waters toward the Barents Sea, favouring further sea ice melting and surface warming in the Barents Sea. Additionally, the retreat of sea ice allows more deep water formation north of Iceland and the thermohaline circulation strengthens there. The transport of warm and saline waters toward the Barents Sea is further enhanced, which constitutes a second positive feedback.','published','Clim.

Atmospheric teleconnections spread the extra-tropical signal to the tropical regions. Once SST anomalies have developed in the Tropics, global atmospheric teleconnections spread the signal around the world creating a global hyper climate mode.

The majority of the IPCC-AR4 models still shows a tendency to overestimate the shortwave and underestimate the longwave downward radiation, each by 6 Wm-2 on average, a long standing problem in many GCMs. A subset of models, however, is now capable of simulating at least one of the downward radiative fluxes with no systematic bias. Model biases in all-sky and clear-sky fluxes are often similar, suggesting that deficiencies in clear-sky radiative transfer calculations are major contributors to the excessive surface insolation in many of the models.

When only land is considered, the global and hemispheric detection results are unchanged, but detectable ANT signals in the zonal bands are limited to low latitudes. The ANT signals are also detectable in the Pm and PI but not in P20 at continental scales over Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia. This indicates that indices located near the center of the GEV distribution (Pm and PI) may give better signal-to-noise ratio than indices representing the tail of the distribution (P20). GHG and NAT signals are also detectable, but less robustly for more limited extreme indices and regions. These results are largely insensitive when model data are masked to mimic the availability of the observed data. An imperfect model analysis in which fingerprints are obtained from simulations with a different GCM suggests that ANT is robustly detectable only at global and hemispheric scales, with high uncertainty in the zonal and continental results.','submitted','Climate Dyn.','','','','','','2007-12-13 10:38:13','2007-12-13 10:42:18','skmin73','skmin73',1),(374,667,'Maxino, C.C, B.J McAvaney, A.J.

On the other hand, for future scenarios the BA is shifted to west, and the CL is stronger and extends its over center of Brazil, generating underestimates the precipitation on the Amazonia.  The GFDL model simulates better the precipitations in fall, over the north of the northeast Brazil. The subtropical highs of the north and south hemisphere show an adequate position to the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone - ITZC (over 5°S).  For future scenarios, this model does not change its circulation pattern, and in the last climatology (2071-2100), it generates positive anomalies over the north of the Amazonia.  The GISS model simulates a summer and spring circulation far from its observed in the present climate.

In the boreal summer and fall (winter and spring), positive precipitation anomalies are found over the northern (southern) hemisphere and negative precipitation anomalies are found over the southern (northern) hemisphere. This precipitation asymmetry in both the El Nino and global warming cases is associated with the seasonal migration of the Hadley circulation. However, their causes are different. In El Nino, a meridional moisture gradient between convective and subsidence regions is the fundamental basis for inducing the asymmetry. Over the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation, convection is enhanced by less effective static stability. Over margins of the ascending branch, convection is suppressed by the import of dry air from the descending branch. In global warming, low-level moisture is enhanced significantly due to warmer tropospheric temperature. This enhances vertical moisture transport over the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation, so convection is strengthened. Over the descending branch, the mean Hadley circulation tends to transport relatively drier air downward, so convection is reduced.','in_press','J.

When the tropical North Atlantic is cool (warm) and the Atlantic warm pool is small (large), both the vertical wind shear and the moist static stability over the main development region (MDR) for hurricanes increase (decrease) while tropical cyclone activity decreases (increases). From the IPCC multi-model data set, we find that the North Atlantic warms more slowly than other oceans as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) decreases, whence a physically consistent scenario, confirmed by IPCC projections, suggests that the atmosphere should respond as if to a small (cool) warm pool and the vertical wind shear and the moist static stability over the MDR should increase, causing tropical cyclone activity to decrease.

The patterns and magnitudes of warming are similar, although the updated projections have slightly less warming in coastal regions.

The air quality calculations were done with both a global chemistry-transport model and a regional air quality model focused on the northeast USA. The air quality simulations assumed no changes in regional anthropogenic emissions of the chemical species primarily involved in the chemical reactions of ozone creation and destruction, but only accounted for changes in the climate. Together, these idealized global and regional model simulations provide insights into the contribution of possible future climate changes on ozone. Over the coming century, summer climate is projected to be warmer and less cloudy for the northeast USA. These changes are considerably larger under the higher scenario as compared with the lower. Higher temperatures also increase biogenic emissions. Both mean daily and 8-h maximum ozone increase from the combination of three factors that tend to favor higher concentrations: (1) higher temperatures change the rates of reactions and photolysis rates important to the ozone chemistry; (2) lower cloudiness (higher solar radiation) increases the photolysis reaction rates; and (3) higher biogenic emissions increase the concentration of reactive species. Regional model simulations with two cumulus parameterizations produce ozone concentration changes that differ by approximately 10%, indicating that there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of changes due to uncertainties in how physical processes should be parameterized in the models. However, the overall effect of the climate changes simulated by these models – in the absence of reductions in regional anthropogenic emissions – would be to increase ozone concentrations.','in_press','Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change','2008','','','doi: 10.1007/s11027-007-9137-y','','2007-12-20 20:45:34','2007-12-20 20:46:14','hayhoe','hayhoe',1),(388,354,'Paradis, Annie, Joe Elkinton, Katharine Hayhoe and John Buonaccorsi','Role of winter temperature and climate change on the survival and future range expansion of the hemlock woolly adelgid ( Adelges tsugae  ) in eastern North America','Global climate change has already affected the abundances, range limits, and interactions of many species.

We used statistically downscaled climate projections generated by the HadCM3 atmosphere–ocean general circulation model, run with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change future emissions scenarios A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower), to evaluate several climate thresholds of direct relevance to agriculture in the region. A longer (frost-free) growing season could create new opportunities for farmers with enough capital to take risks on new crops (assuming a market for new crops can be developed). However, our results indicate that many crops will have yield losses associated with increased frequency of high temperature stress, inadequate winter chill period for optimum fruiting in spring, increased pressure from marginally over-wintering and/or invasive weeds, insects, or disease, or other factors. Weeds are likely to benefit more than cash crops from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Projections of thermal heat index values for dairy cows indicate a substantial potential negative impact on milk production. At the higher compared to lower emissions scenario, negative climate change effects will occur sooner, and impact a larger geographic area within the region.

This study examined the vulnerability of the two largest winter recreation industries, snowmobiling and alpine skiing, to four climate change scenarios for the twenty-first century. Under all scenarios, natural snow became an increasingly scarce resource. The diminished natural snow pack had a very negative impact on the snowmobile industry. As early as 2010–2039, 4 to 6 of the 15 snowmobile study areas were projected to lose more than half of the current season. Reliable snowmobile seasons (>50 days) were virtually eliminated in the region under the A1Fi scenarios by 2070–2099. The large investment in snowmaking substantially reduced the vulnerability of the ski industry and climate change posed a risk to only 4 of the 14 ski areas in 2010–2039, where average ski seasons declined below 100 days and the probability of being open for the entire Christmas–New Year’s holiday declined below 75%.

In order to minimize ski season losses, snowmaking requirements are projected to increase substantially, raising important uncertainties about water availability and cost.

Raising sea level not only increases the likelihood of coastal flooding, but changes the template for waves and tides to sculpt the coast, which can lead to land loss orders of magnitude greater than that from direct inundation alone. There is little question that sea-level rise, and in particular an increased rate of rise, will result in permanent losses of coastal land. However, quantitative predictions of these future coastal change remains difficult due in part to the complexity of coastal systems and the influence of infrequent storm events, and is further confounded by coastal science’s insufficient understanding of the behavior of coastal systems over decadal timescales. Recently, dramatic improvements in technology have greatly improved our capabilities to investigate and characterize processes and sedimentary deposits in the coastal zone, allowing us, for the first time, to address some of the over-arching problems involved in shoreline change. Despite advances in many areas of coastal geology, our fundamental understanding of shoreline change has been limited by a lack of a broad and integrated scientific focus, a lack of resources, and a lack of willingness on the part of policymakers who make crucial decisions about human activity along the coast to support basic research in this area. Although quantitative predictions remain constrained, there remains little doubt that the predicted climates changes will have profound effects upon the Northeastern coast.','in_press','Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change','2008','','','doi: 10.1007/s11027-007-9124-3','http://www.springerlink.com/content/e414k4x6168061v9/?p=99fa28a6f9aa4331b3e253336bdd246c&pi=0','2007-12-20 20:52:07','2007-12-20 20:52:07','hayhoe','hayhoe',1),(395,354,'Iverson, Louis, Anantha Prasad and Stephen Matthews','Modeling potential climate change impacts on the trees of the northeastern United States','We evaluated 134 tree species from the eastern United States for potential response to several scenarios of climate change, and summarized those responses for nine northeastern United States.

After accounting for the overall decline in cod during this period, we show that the probability of catching cod at specified locations decreased markedly with increasing bottom temperature. Our analysis of future changes in water temperature was based on output from three coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models under high and low CO2 emissions. An increase of <1.5°C is predicted for all sectors under the low emission scenario in spring and autumn by the end of this century. Under the high emission scenario, temperature increases range from &#8764;2°C in the north to >3.5°C in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Under these conditions, cod appear vulnerable to a loss of thermal habitat on Georges Bank, with a substantial loss of thermal habitat farther south. We also examined temperature effects on cod recruitment and growth in one stock area, the Gulf of Maine, to explore potential implications for yield and resilience to fishing. Cod survival during the early life stages declined with increasing water temperatures, offsetting potential increases in growth with warmer temperatures and resulting in a predicted loss in yield and increased vulnerability to high fishing mortality rates.

Although predicted changes in climate have important implications for a number of ecosystem processes, our present understanding of their long-term effects is poor. In this study, we used the PnET-CN model of forest carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water cycling to evaluate the effects of predicted changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on forest growth, C exchange, water runoff, and nitrate ($$ {\\text{NO}}^{ - }_{3} $$) leaching at five forest research sites across the northeastern U.S. We used four sets of statistically downscaled climate predictions from two general circulation models (the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and the Parallel Climate Model) and two scenarios of future CO2 concentrations. A series of model experiments was conducted to examine the effects of future temperature, precipitation, CO2, and various assumptions regarding the physiological response of forests to these changes. Results indicate a wide range of predicted future growth rates. Increased growth was predicted across deciduous sites under most future conditions, while growth declines were predicted for spruce forests under the warmest scenarios and in some deciduous forests when CO2 fertilization effects were absent. Both climate and rising CO2 contributed to predicted changes, but their relative importance shifted from CO2-dominated to climate-dominated from the first to second half of the twenty-first century. Predicted runoff ranged from no change to a slight decrease, depending on future precipitation and assumptions about stomatal response to CO2. Nitrate leaching exhibited variable responses, but was highest under conditions that imposed plant stress with no physiological effects of CO2. Although there are considerable uncertainties surrounding predicted responses to climate change, these results provide a range of possible outcomes and highlight interactions among processes that are likely to be important. Such information can be useful to scientists and land managers as they plan on means of examining and responding to the effects of climate change.','in_press','Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change','2008','','','doi: 10.1007/s11027-007-9128-z','http://www.springerlink.com/content/v116x4856n83733j/?p=e25724d4952d43d697a3fca643d02659&pi=12','2007-12-20 20:55:32','2007-12-20 20:55:32','hayhoe','hayhoe',1),(398,354,'Rodenhouse, N.L., S.

First, we created distribution and abundance models for common bird species using climate, elevation, and tree species variables and modeled how bird distributions might change as habitats shift. Second, we assessed potential effects on high-elevation birds, especially Bicknell’s thrush (Catharus bicknelli), that may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, by using statistical associations between climate, spruce-fir forest vegetation and bird survey data. Last, we complemented these projections with an assessment of how habitat quality of a migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) might be affected by climate change. Large changes in bird communities of the Northeast are likely to result from climate change, and these changes will be most dramatic under a scenario of continued high emissions. Indeed, high-elevation bird species may currently be at the threshold of critical change with as little as 1°C warming reducing suitable habitat by more than half. Species at mid elevations are likely to experience declines in habitat quality that could affect demography. Although not all species will be affected adversely, some of the Northeast’s iconic species, such as common loon and black-capped chickadee, and some of its most abundant species, including several neotropical migrants, are projected to decline significantly in abundance under all climate change scenarios.

In 2001 the 3rd Assessment Report of the IPCC noted that some modern coupled GCMs are able to maintain stable runs without flux adjustments. In the PCMDI\'s first appraisal of the state of the art of coupled GCMs, we confirmed and elaborated this finding by examining output from the most recent phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We found that surface temperature trends are small compared with observed trends, as expected for control run simulations in which external climate forcing factors are held constant. Deep ocean temperature and salinity trends are small enough for model control runs to extend over 1000 years or more, but trends in some regions, most notably the Arctic, are inconsistent among the models and may be problematic.\r\n\r\nWe plan to repeat this study using control run output from models contributing to the 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC.

Emphasis will be the seasonal (monthly) variation across Australia of temperature, precipitation and surface pressure, to determine how well the observed climatologies, as well as their seasonal variations are captured by the models. \r\n\r\nA second component of the study will address the impact of climate change on temperature and precipitation in the Australian region as projected by the models. In particular, we are interested in evaluating the evolution of the Australian component of the Asian-Australian monsoon under climate change conditions. Depending upon time, other variables (e.g. cloud cover, soil moisture, winds) may also be considered, as available, in both current climate and under climate change.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nThe Australian continent extends from the tropics to mid latitudes, and poses a particular challenge for climate models. The Australian tropics are strongly influenced by the surrounding oceans, and are subject to a strongly varying seasonal cycle of precipitation and surface pressure, dominated by the Australian component of the Asian-Australian monsoon (e.g. McBride, 1998). Total precipitation in northern Australia is strongly influenced by ENSO, showing marked interannual variability. Winter conditions in tropical Australia, on the other hand are subject to mild, and relatively dry, southeast trades.\r\n\r\nSouthern Australian regions are subject to eastward moving mid latitudes cyclones. The mean location of the cyclone belt varies seasonally from south of the continent in summer, to the southern portion of the continent in winter, with consequent seasonality of temperature and precipitation. Central parts of the continent are predominantly dry, with occasional precipitation episodes penetrating from the north and south. Other distinctive features contribute to mid continental precipitation, such as north-west cloud bands. Topography across the continent is generally low, although the eastern ranges have a significant impact on regional temperatures and precipitation.\r\n\r\nThese patterns of precipitation: monsoonal in the north, Mediterranean in the southwest, \'mid latitude\' in the southeast, and dry in the centre are important features to capture in climate models. As part of the CMIP2 subproject 54, Moise et al. (manuscript in preparation) have reported a preliminary analysis of 18 CMIP2 models in their simulations of key surface climate and surface fluxes in the Australian region. Significant model deficiencies in their simulations of rainfall and surface temperature climatologies were identified.\r\n\r\nThe AR4 model comparison offers a unique opportunity to (a) examine how the latest versions of coupled models represent basic features such as pressure, temperature and precipitation in the current Australian region climate, including their seasonal and geographical variations, and (b) investigate projected climate change under standard scenarios. Time permitting, a further study of basic features of the Australian monsoon will also be considered. This is a necessary component in the ongoing efforts of projecting future climate changes in Australia using coupled climate models. The IPCC assessment of vulnerability report (Watson et al., 1998) noted particular concern for Australia for changes to the timing, intensity and location of tropical monsoon systems, and location and intensities of mid latitude weather systems and the subtropical anti cyclone belt. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nThe first stage of the study will involve a comparison of annual and monthly AR4/CMIP control simulations (20th century simulation or other ‘control’ simulations) with ‘observed’ values. ‘Observational’ data sets here include the Australian Bureau of Meteorology rainfall and temperature data sets, as well as ERA-40 and NCEP reanalyses. Comparisons will be of mean fields, as well as geographical patterns and seasonal changes of surface temperature, precipitation (including monsoon precipitation) and MSLP. \r\n\r\nThe second stage involves a comparison of patterns of future climate change projected by the AR4/CMIP models for the Australian region. This will consist of comparisons of the last 20 years of the control versus the SRES experiments, as well as comparisons of the full experiment time series.\r\n\r\nA later part of the project will consider interannual variability, in addition to the calculation of standard deviation from multi-year model integrations in measuring the interannual climate variations simulated by the models.\r\n\r\nTo further understand the role of ENSO in affecting Australian climate interannual variations, some simple statistics, such as the correlations of surface climate variables with Nino3.4 index, will be calculated from the AR4/CMIP runs.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nMcBride, J., 1998: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and tropical Australia: the Southern Hemisphere monsoon.

Although the model predictions of climate change for a few decades from now will likely vary by a substantially smaller amount (because in transient climate change, ocean heat uptake tends to moderate differences in climate sensitivity), the reasons for differences in global climate sensitivity can shed light both on why models differ, and also on which feedbacks are largest and most important to get right. Thus, the uncertainty in future predictions of climate change can be better gauged if the feedbacks are better understood. We propose to analyze feedbacks in the climate models by focusing primarily on the idealized coupled model experiments involving 1% per year increases in CO2 and the slab ocean equilibrium experiment in which CO2 is doubled. These idealized experiments are the easiest to analyze because the CO2 radiative forcing scales logarithmically with concentration. If the modeling groups calculate clear-sky and all sky CO2 radiative forcing for a doubled concentration of CO2, we will be able to use methods for estimating feedbacks by monitoring the fluxes of radiation at the top of the atmosphere. We should be able to gauge the relative importance of shortwave and longwave cloud feedbacks (due to overall cloud fraction changes as well as changes in the combined effects of distribution and optical propoerties), surface albedo feedbacks (e.g., due to snow, sea ice, vegetation changes) and also the combined effects of water vapor and lapse rate. We expect to consider not only the global differences in feedbacks among the IPCC models, but also their spatial and perhaps seasonal differences.

Given that it is the dominant mode of variability on time scales of 2-7 years, this is a mode of ocean/atmosphere variability that is important to represent in coupled models. The study of AchutaRao and Sperber (2002, Climate Dynamics, 19, 191-209) provided a standard methodology for analyzing the space-time variability of ENSO in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 2 (CMIP 2) models. While difficulties remain in the simulation of ENSO (e.g., amplitude, seasonality, and periodicity), our subsequent analysis of revised models from CMIP 2+ indicates that improvement in the simulation of ENSO has been realized through model development (AchutaRao et al. 2004, An Appraisal of Coupled Climate Models, PCMDI Technical Report, UCRL-TR-202550).

A methodology is utilized to analyze in a standardized fashion the MJO in general circulation models. This is attained by projecting 20-100 day bandpass filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the models onto the two leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFÕs) of observed OLR that characterize the propagation of MJO convection from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific Ocean. The resulting principal component time series are then screened to isolate boreal winters during which they exhibit a lead-lag relationship consistent with observations. This PC subset is used for linear regression to determine the ability of the models to simulate the observed space-time variability of the MJO. Analysis of control integrations of the CMIP2+ models indicates that the vast majority of models underestimate the amplitude of the MJO convective anomalies by a factor of two or more, and the eastward propagation of convection is less coherent than observed, typically. For a given family of models, coupling to an ocean leads to better organization of the large-scale convection. The low-level moisture convergence mechanism for eastward propagation of the MJO is represented in limited cases, as is the vertical structure of moisture and divergence. The analysis of the CMIP2+ models provides a frame of reference for evaluating improvement in the simulation of the MJO in the IPCC control simulations.\r\n\r\nIt is envisioned that the IPCC control runs will first be analyzed to determine the models that give the most realistic representation of the MJO based on the afore-mentioned diagnostics. With this subset of models the climate change integrations will be analyzed to ascertain anthropogenically forced perturbations to this important mode of variability. Previous work by Slingo et al. (1999, QJRMS, 125, 583-609) has demonstrated an increased amplitude of observed MJO variability as the tropics warmed in the post-1976 regime transition compared to earlier decades. This suggests that additional warming due to anthropogenic climate change may strongly influence the MJO. During years when the MJO is active, the tendency is for below-normal rainfall over Austral-Asia, mainly due to reduced convection during the suppressed phase of the MJO.

We would like to participate in the “multi-model analysis activity” by estimating the noise covariance that is required for the climate change detection problem for surface, upper-air and deep-ocean temperatures. One key issue is the short length of unforced control runs for estimating the noise covariance matrix.  Typically, a climate model control run is a few hundred years long and only yields a small number of independent 50 or 100 year segments that can be used as noise realizations.   We would create a multi-model ensemble from the available control simulations. A primary question is whether the estimates of C_N from the individual models are distinguishable from each other. If not, the multi-model ensemble should provide a significantly larger number of degrees of freedom to improve the estimated C_N. If they do differ, this would be an equally interesting result, and their differences would be one source of uncertainty in the detection analyses.\r\n\r\nThis would require the longest available time-series from the control run data as available for each coupled model.

The incoming shortwave irradiance at the surface is one driving mechanism of the ocean/ice and land submodels and while it is directly affected by the physics in the atmosphere such as clouds, aerosols, water vapor, ozone and other gases it is only indirectly affected by the ocean/ice/land. Hence, aerosol and cloud variations have a strong  direct  signal on the downwelling shortwave surface irradiance which can be easily interpreted. At the same time, surface solar irradiance and its link to clouds and aerosols represents one crucial part of the cloud feedback loop. Furthermore, there has been increased interest in the scientific community regarding the long-term variability of the surface incoming solar irradiance. Observations show that solar irradiance has recently been decreasing in stations worldwide by about 4% from 1961-1990, possibly due to changed aerosol concentrations and cloud variations. This has been described as a global  dimming  effect. Current research (from satellite observations) shows a reversal of this effect from the late 1980s and during the 1990s. We will use two data sets, which represent two different classes of data retrieval methods, from satellites and in situ measurements: ISCCP-FD surface radiation fluxes (2.50  2.50, 3 hourly, 1984-2000) and broadband surface solar irradiance records from pyranometer measurements at sites worldwide from 1950s onwards (GEBA, USNSRDB, BSRN).

However, the 15 models analyzed in this project are consistent in predicting summer dryness and winter wetness in only part of the northern middle and high latitudes. Slightly over half of the models predict year-round wetness in central Eurasia and/or year-round dryness in Siberia and mid-latitude Northeast Asia.

Models are especially consistent in predicting drier soil over the US Southwest, the Mediterranean, Australia, and the South Africa in all seasons, and over much of the Amazon and West Africa in the JJA season and the Asian monsoon region in the DJF season. Since the only major areas of future wetness predicted with a high level of model consistency are part of the northern middle and high latitudes during the non-growing season, it is suggested that greenhouse gas warming will cause a worldwide agricultural drought.

Several authors (Sun and Liu 1996 and Li 2000) have tried to incorporate ocean dynamical heating into the heat budget analysis. However, their attempts to formulate a dynamical thermostat hypothesis failed due to the inadequate assumption of zonal heat recycling in the tropical Pacific. The issue of cloud- and dynamical thermostats has not been resolved yet from a theoretical perspective. \r\n\r\nMoreover, climate model simulations tend to show a large uncertainty in their greenhouse warming temperature projections in the warm pool area, partly due to differences in cloud-representation and partly due to ocean dynamics. In a 4xCO2 simulations performed recently with the HadCM3 model (T. Toniazzo, personal communication) , warm pool temperatures rose up to 36 degree Celsius. Positive feedbacks seem to accelerate this warming and overcome cloud and dynamical thermostat effects. Such a potential change may have severe consequences for the global atmospheric circulation (Hoerling et al. 2001), encompassing the extratropics and also on ENSO amplitude (Sun 2003). So far the detailed reasons for the simulated model discrepancies have not been analyzed thoroughly.\r\n\r\nUsing the GFDL and NCAR IPCC scenario runs of the 20th-22nd century, we will study the heat balance of the warm pool, in terms of radiative processes and ocean dynamical heating. A revised thermostat theory, capturing meridional heat advection will be formulated and applied to the CGCM data. The goal of our planned research is to investigate the sensitivity of thermostats or super-greenhouse effects under greenhouse warming conditions. Physical processes that lead to different model responses will be identified. The amplitude of strong El Niño events is tightly linked to mean warm pool temperature. Hence, understanding the physics of thermostats or super-greenhouse effects will help to assess also ENSO\'s response to greenhouse warming. We are planning to generate time-series for the individual simulations of each term in the western and eastern Pacific heat-budget equation.

David','neelin@atmos.ucla.edu','310-206-3734','','UCLA','Climate model global warming simulations predict large regional changes in tropical rainfall, including regions of drought.  Qualitatively similar changes occur during El Nino interannual variability.  Using an intermediate climate model, we have identified a mechanism that creates regional reductions in precipitation at the margins of convection zones during warming.  In this ``upped-ante mechanism\'\', a warm troposphere increases the value of surface boundary layer moisture required for convection to occur.  In regions of plentiful moisture supply, moisture simply rises to maintain precipitation, but this increases the moisture gradient relative to neighboring subsidence regions.  Reductions in rainfall then result for those margins of convection zones that have strong inflow of air from the subsidence regions and less frequently meet the increased ``ante\'\' for convection. In the intermediate climate model simulations analyzed, the upped-ante mechanism is the leading cause of tropical drought in the global warming case and is dominant in certain El Nino drought regions.  In the ``anomalous gross moist stability mechanism\", gross moist stability is reduced due to increased ABL moisture.  As a result, convection is enhanced and precipitation becomes heavier over convective regions. While the upped-ante mechanism induces negative precipitation anomalies over the margins of convective regions, the anomalous gross moist stability mechanism induces positive precipitation anomalies within convective regions.  The importance of variation in gross moist stability, which is likely to differ among climate models, is suggested as a potential factor causing discrepancies in the predicted tropical regional precipitation changes. \r\n\r\nWe propose to evaluate the GCM output for the following relationships:  tropical tropospheric temperature and moisture relations; moisture increase in convection zones relative to other regions; relationship of drought to convective margins with inflow and to moisture gradients; terms from the moist static energy (MSE) budget useful to pathway diagnostics; contribution of surface fluxes over ocean regions as a signature of ocean dynamical feedbacks compared to other MSE budget terms.  These relationships will be evaluated for consistency with hypothesized mechanisms and for indications of other mechanisms that might be at work. \r\n\r\nDetailed evaluation will center first on changes for 30 year averages in the late 21st century when the warming is well established and the signals are large. We will begin with the SRES A1B case (relative to control) and the 2xCO2 equilibrium simulations with mixed-layer oceans which  provide a slightly simpler comparison case. Once we believe we have established a reasonable set of mechanisms and that the evaluation procedures are working, we will then apply to the other available runs and time periods. We will conduct a survey of precipitation changes over the available runs and time periods early on, to guesstimate if there will be suprises relative to A1B and add periods/runs to the initial evaluation if needed. \r\n\r\nBased on preliminary assessment of data from the IPCC/DDC site and from ECHAM4, we anticipate that the mechanisms will differ more among models than among scenarios for a given model.  We also have indications that the multi-model ensemble approach seen in IPCC AR3 has severe limitations for tropical rainfall anomalies.  For instance, at least one model that predict rainfall increases in subsaharan Africa does so because in the model climatology the region is in the center, not the margin, of a strong convection zone.  We postulate that it may be possible to constrain the model subset used for each region based on criteria for climatology We also have seen indications from AMIP2 data that the models behave quite differently, some rather imperfectly, in ENSO teleconnection response. Unfortunately, the AMIP2 data are not coordinated with AR4, although some models overlap.  We will take a preliminary look at using ENSO response as a means of evaluating quality of model response for particular sensitive regions, such as eastern equatorial South America, although this part is less likely to be completed in the tight time frame for AR4 turnaround. \r\n\r\nFields to be used include all surface and top-of-atmosphere fluxes, surface precipitation, and atmospheric 3-D winds, moisture and temperature.  While the data specifications did not include divergence or the divergent wind component nor certain moisture flux terms useful in MSE budgets, we will use the available data.  We can then provide feedback to the WGCM on the errors introduced by post-calculation of such terms, and on additional fields that it would be desirable to have for future comparisons for diagnosing tropical moist processes.

Clouds are also the dominant modulators of radiation both at the surface and top of atmosphere (TOA), and their impact on the Earth’s radiation budget mainly depends on the bulk properties of clouds such as cloud amount, height, and microphsycal/optical features (Wielicki et al. 1998; Curry et al. 2000; Houghton et al. 2001). Characterizing cloud radiative effects on the surface is a critical component for understanding the current climate and an important step towards simulating potential climate change. Cloud radiative forcing (CRF) is a simple but effective means of studying cloud-radiation interactions and diagnosing problems in general circulation models (GCM) because the CRF represents the bulk effects of clouds on the surface radiation budget.\r\n\r\nWe are developing a climatology of mid-latitude continental cloud properties and their impact on the surface radiation budget using data collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) central facility (SCF; 36.6oN, 97.5oW; see (Ackerman and Stokes 2003) from January 1997 to December 2002. We calculate the cloud fractions of total, and single-layer low, middle, and high clouds, and their corresponding CRFs.  We rely entirely on both radar and lidar/ceilometer measurements to identify clear sky, total cloud cover, and single-layer low, middle, and high clouds first, then we average clear-sky net (down-up) SW and LW fluxes during a certain time period (a month or season), finally we calculate the seasonal and monthly mean SW, LW, and net CRF for each category. \r\n\r\nNow, we propose to compare our surface observations with CMIP\'s up-to-date monthly average outputs. We want to test whether the shortwave and long wave fluxes at the surface under different conditions between the observational and model results will be consistent.

If  they are not consistent to each other, what is the reason to cause the discrepancy?  \r\n\r\nThe parameters will be:\r\n(1)Clear-sky downwelling shortwave flux at the earth’s surface\r\nThe radiative transfer model can accurately calculate the atmospheric absorption of solar radiation, therefore, the difference between the observational downwelling shortwave flux with the calculated clear-sky downwelling flux is expected to be small;\r\n\r\n(2)All-sky shortwave downwelling flux at the earth’s surface\r\nThe cloud absorption to solar radiation is one of the biggest uncertainties in the GCMs. We try to find a way to calculate the cloud absorption by using model\'s TOA downwelling flux and the observed downwelling flux at the surface.

An expansion of the tropics represents an extremely important aspect of climate change, which implies major changes in the general circulation.

Our objectives are to assess:  1. Do GCMs forecast (or hindcast) the interannual variability of seasonal rainfall in monsoon regions that we have been examining using reanalysis, satellite and in-situ data?  2. Is the relationship of simulated interannual precipitation variability to GCM generated sea surface temperature fields the same as in reanalysis or real data?  3. Can this information be used to generate an improved multi-model ensemble forecast of monsoon precipitation under future climate change? We will derive a multi-model ensemble forecast of the probability of changes in the seasonal precipitation and interannual variability during the 21st century (and possibly the 22nd and 23rd) using a combination of subjective and objective skill tests of the GCMs. Objectively, simulations of the 20th century can be compared to seasonal precipitation data, generating a skill score for each model. Recognizing that these climate simulations cannot forecast individual years, we would test the skill of model simulations of the seasonal mean and interannual variability for periods on the order of decades, and we would focus on area average precipitation for each monsoon region. For a 10-year period for example, each model would generate 10 ensemble-member forecasts (each ensemble member from one year of seasonal precipitation), and for example a rank probability skill score or cross-probability density function for each model would be assembled from the complete 20th century. Further analysis will help determine why individual models produce good or poor monsoon precipitation simulations. Correlations of interannual precipitation variability to SST (and lagged SST) would be examined for each model and compared to the correlations using climate data. Models that do not produce a reasonable monsoon simulation could be objectively excluded from a multi-model ensemble forecast of future climate change. Probabilistic forecasts of future monsoon precipitation will be determined using the skill of each model to generate a weighting function. Our primary objective would be to determine if a useful seasonal rainfall hindcast for monsoon regions could be calculated from GCM simulations, and then to apply the same procedure to monsoon precipitation forecasts in future climate change simulations in a form of nearest-neighbor forecast.

The transient waves interact with low-frequency climate variations, and the interacting processes have been recently highlighted in the scientific community. However, there are still uncertainties how the transient wave activity will response to the climate changes and feedback to climate system. Therefore, we will investigate changes of transient wave activity over extra-tropical region and analyze its impact on the Asian monsoon variation in the IPCC AR4 Coupled GCM simulations. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we will investigate the role of air-sea coupled processes on the Asian monsoon simulation. Recently, we found that the several atmospheric GCMs, prescribed observed SST, have a poor performance for the simulation of anomalous Asian summer rainfall patterns (Kang et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2004). The models’ deficiency results from failing to simulate correctly the relationship between the local summer rainfall and SST anomalies over warm pool region. The observed rainfall anomalies are negatively correlated with SST anomalies, whereas in nearly all atmospheric models, the rainfall anomalies are positively correlated with SST anomalies. This contrast implies that air-sea coupled processes play a critical role for the simulation of the East Asia Monsoon.

This builds on ongoing work examining the uncertainty, due to intermodel variability of GCM projections of precipitation and temperature, of projected hydrologic changes through 2100. This study uses monthly values of average temperature and precipitation from 10 GCMs (all of the models that participated in the most recent phase of CMIP, and that provided atmospheric data). The monthly GCM data are bias corrected using a quantile mapping technique that forces the monthly statistics of the GCM output for a climatological period to match the monthly statistics of the overlapping observations, while allowing evolution of the mean and variability of the GCM into the future. Spatial downscaling is performed by interpolating to 1/8 degree the ratio of each month’s precipitation (from the GCM) to the climatological observed value for each GCM-scale grid cell, and interpolating the shift in temperature between the GCM and observed values. Daily values of precipitation and temperature at 1/8 degree are generated using random resampling from the historical record, with rescaling of precipitation and shifting of temperature so the monthly average matches the bias-corrected and interpolated monthly GCM values. These daily sequences from each GCM are used to drive a hydrological model, which ultimately generates streamflow at strategic points throughout California. The differences in mean values of monthly streamflows under a control run and a perturbed (1%/year increasing CO2) run are compared to the inter-model variability to examine which changes are consistent across models, and which are less so. Since the California region is highly dependent on snow accumulation and melt, the changes in the timing of the annual hydrograph are also tested for robustness of timing shifts between different GCMs. A final experiment is performed where identical precipitation is used for all GCMs, to isolate the contribution of temperature and precipitation variability between models to the overall variability. The proposed analysis will duplicate this study using the results submitted by the participating modeling groups. This study will examine the inter-model variability of hydrological impacts projected through 2100 for the participating GCMs, and contrast the inter-model variability between the two scenarios A1fi and B1. In each case, the inter-model variability will be statistically compared to the projected hydrologic changes, to quantify the significance level of the change in monthly flows and the shift in annual hydrograph peak.','2004-08-30','',1,''),(83,110,'Using IPCC simulations for the 20th and 21st centu','Scholze','Marko','marko.scholze@bris.ac.uk','+44-117-3315132','','QUEST, Dep. of Earth Sciences, Uni of Bristol','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(84,111,'Model Simulation of the Southern Hemisphere Atmospheric Circulation, Antarctic Sea Ice, and their Interaction: An Evaluation','Raphael','Marilyn','raphael@geog.ucla.edu','310-206-4590','','University of California, Los Angeles','','2004-09-01','Marika Holland',1,''),(86,113,'IPCC subproject','Saenko','Oleg','oleg.saenko@ec.gc.ca','01-250-363-8267','','Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(87,114,'IPCC subproject','Saenko','Oleg','oleg.saenko@ec.gc.ca','01-250-363-8267','','Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(88,115,'IPCC AR4','McHugh','Maurice','mmchug4@lsu.edu','225-578-0476','','Louisiana State University','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(89,116,'Validation and future projection of modeled extreme daily precipitation','Emori','Seita','emori@nies.go.jp','+81-29-850-2724','','National Institute for Environmental Studies','Though previous studies have suggested general enhancement of heavy precipitation in the course of global warming, the validation of models’ ability to represent extreme precipitation has been insufficient and the mechanism that enhances heavy precipitation has not been well explained.

All these studies have shown that with the analysis of available instrumental historical and other data sets, some valuable scientific insight can be gained on the Asian monsoons on inter-annual and decadal time scales. A few of the important results of these studies are as follows:\r\n\r\n* The short-term climate variability over these regions depicts decadal variability with certain epochs of above and below normal rainfall. While the epochs tend to last for three decades over South and East Asia, they last for about a decade over the equatorial regions of Southeast Asia. Further the turning points over East Asia follow those of South Asia about a decade later.\r\n\r\n* Impact of ENSO events on summer monsoon rainfall is modulated by the decadal behavior of rainfall ie impact of El Nino (La Nina) is more severe during the below (above) normal epochs. Thus impact depends on the prevailing epoch.\r\n             \r\n* The inter-connections between the monsoon-related events (rainfall over South Asia, rainfall over East Asia, northern hemisphere circulation, tropical Pacific circulation) appear to strengthen (or weaken) around the same time, for example the relationship among these events during 1890-1930 was weak while during 1930-1970 it was strong.

The results have offered evidence that the CO2-induced response pattern is closely related to the model natural variability, though the selection of mode and polarity referring to the natural variability is not deterministic among the models. Several models indicate a response pattern projected on the spatial structure of the ENSO (El Nino-like or La Nina-like) that is the leading mode of natural variability, while others indicate a response pattern projected on those of higher modes. A similar analysis of wintertime field variables in the Northern Hemisphere has confirmed the relationship (Noda & Yamaguchi 2001). Several models indicate a response pattern projected on the spatial structure of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) that is the leading mode of natural variability, while other models indicate a response pattern projected on those of higher modes. Moreover, the analysis relating both regions has suggested that the effects of ENSO and AO upon the response pattern overlap over the North Pacific; the balance of domination between ENSO and AO in this region plays a key role for the entire response pattern in determining the selection of mode and polarity referring to the natural variabilities.

Two studies have looked at the impact of future climate change on desert dust [Mahowald and Luo, 2003; Tegen et al., 2004] and came up with different sensitivities (20-60% decrease, or +/-20%, respectively).  Part of these differences are likely to be due to differences in coupled models, and part due to differences in the methodologies used.  In this CMIP study, we propose to use the methodology of Mahowald and Luo, 2003 with the different models to look at changes in desert dust source regions due to climate change and carbon dioxide.  Although we may not be able to include accurately the impact of wind speed changes (because of the non-linearity of the dust source relationship to wind speed), we should be able to predict from monthly mean surface temperature, precipitation and cloudiness changes in desert areas, and their impact on desert dust source areas using the BIOME3 (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996) equilibrium vegetation model.  We propose to do this for all available models for future climate, and submit the resulting paper before May, 2005.

To do this, MAGICC was first ‘calibrated’ by Sarah Raper against a range of different AOGCMs using data from 1% compound CO2 increase experiments archived in the CMIP data base. This\r\ninvolved tuning the main parameters of MAGICC (climate sensitivity, effective oceanic diffusivity, etc.) against AOGCM results for different variables such as global-mean temperature, land-ocean temperature differentials, etc. So-tuned, MAGICC was able to emulate the global-mean temperature and oceanic thermal expansion results from individual AOGCMs with high accuracy, justifying its use to expand these results to cover emissions scenarios not considered directly by the AOGCMs.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this project will use the new AR4 AOGCM results in the same way so that these new models may also be emulated with MAGICC. This is directed towards the possible use of MAGICC to produce a wider spectrum of global-mean temperature (and sea level) projections for AR4 than would otherwise be available. This work will be carried out by Wigley and Raper. Santer is involved to assist in accessing appropriate data from the AR4 data files. Nychka is involved to assist in applying more rigorous statistical tools than previously to the AOGCM/MAGICC comparisons that underlie the calibration exercise. All investigators will be involved in analysis and interpretation of the results. The plan is to perform the calibrations using 1% CO2 experiment results (accounting for control-run drift if necessary) and to test these calibrations with data from other forcing experiments. \r\n\r\nFor this work to be carried out effectively we require, ideally, annual-mean, gridpoint data from (at least) 1% CO2 runs and the parallel control runs for: reference height temperature, sea surface temperatures, and ocean temperatures through the full ocean column. The latter are used to determine net changes in ocean heat content, which is the most accurate way to quantify heat flux into the ocean. We also require oceanic thermal expansion data, some indicator of changes in the thermohaline circulation, and the top of the troposphere radiative forcing for 2xCO2 (after stratospheric equilibration). For testing against other forcing experiments we require estimates of the total forcing time series for these experiments and the breakdown of this forcing between land and ocean in each hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this project involves the use of a new GSIC model developed by Sarah Raper to quantify future changes in this component of the ice-melt contribution to sea level rise. The use of this model will be a major conceptual advance on the way GSICs were modeled in the TAR – where an ad hoc correction factor produced an unrealistic upper bound to GSIC melt. These calculations will be carried out on a gridpoint basis over the globe (for regions where GSICs exist) and will use the temperature data requested for the MAGICC calibration exercise.

Sea ice retreat implies increased evaporation and thus can lead to increased cloud formation, though it is unclear how the clouds will actually respond as their formation depends not only on the local moisture budget but on synoptic patterns and the advection of heat and moisture. The simulation of these processes vary significantly among the models which is in part responsible for the contribution of clouds to the uncertainty in the ice-albedo feedback magnitude. The difficulty in estimating the effects of sea ice and clouds on radiation has been aggravated by lack of long and accurate data sets of the TOA radiative fluxes and clouds in the polar regions.

The partitioning between atmospheric and oceanic heat transport is not trivial. Recent studies show that in the tropics atmospheric and oceanic heat transport changes may act in concert while others argue that they compensate in the midlatitudes. Changes in heat transport relate to changes in stability and circulation of both the atmosphere and ocean. It is unclear how the climate reorganizes under greenhouse forcing to accommodate these changes.

Traditional methods of evaluating clouds in general circulation models (GCMs) have focused on comparing multi-annual mean maps of cloud variables with satellite observations. However, the ability to simulate the time-mean geographical distribution of present-day cloud may not offer a stringent constraint on the cloud radiative feedback under climate change. A possible alternative approach is to identify key processes associated with the cloud response to climate change, which are demonstrated to be important in a range of GCMs, and attempt to find analogues in present day climate variability. Compositing techniques to define ‘regimes’ (dynamical regimes, cloud regimes, physico-dynamical regimes, etc.) have been shown to be especially useful in separating particular processes, however there are a number of different compositing methods in the literature, many of which have not, to date, been demonstrated to constrain the cloud response to climate change. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) has two sub-projects (sub-projects 1 and 3) which aim to test a range of these compositng methods in ±2K atmosphere-only and 2xCO2 atmosphere-mixed layer ocean experiments. It would be extremely valuable to extend these techniques to coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations, in order to test the generality of the results in a full coupled system. The CFMIP diagnostic list was designed with the requirements for cloud compositing as a focus. In particular, the project requests high temporal resolution (daily) data from the ISCCP simulator. ISCCP simulator diagnostics are marked as ‘lower priority output’ in the CMIP lists and only requested as monthly means, hence not all of the analysis to be carried out on the CFMIP experiments can be repeated on the CMIP models. However, some of the simpler cloud compositing techniques being utilised in CFMIP either do not use ISCCP simulator output, or use monthly mean ISCCP data. We intend to apply these techniques to the 1%/year simulations in CMIP in order to test whether there are significant differences in cloud processes occurring as part of transient climate change in a full coupled system compared with the equilibrium climate in more idealised atmosphere-mixed layer and atmosphere-only experiments. It will also form a valuable test of the generality of the conclusions from the CFMIP compositing sub-projects for the IPCC AR4.

Variabilities in their properties are thus potential indicators of changes in surface forcing. For example, Banks et al. (2000) found that Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) is a potentially sensitive indicator of anthropogenic climate change. This deduction was based on a comparison of the observed changes of the water mass between two snapshots (1962 and 1987) with that simulated by a climate model (HadCM3) driven by anthropogenic forcing. The simulated freshening and cooling were comparable with that observed in both magnitude and pattern. A recent survey along 32 deg-S in the Indian Ocean provided another snapshot (2002), showing that there has been a reversal of the SAMW freshening  trend with the water mass properties being almost identical to their 1962 values (Bryden et al. 2003). However, this reversal is not reproduced by any of the HadCM3 simulations. Instead, the freshening trend continues in model experiments that include anthropogenic forcing. A comprehensive analysis of the SAMW in HadCM3 recently conducted by Stark et al. (2004), making use of a large set of ensemble experiments with different atmospheric forcing scenarios, concludes that the observed decadal variability of the SAMW can only be explained by internal variability, and that the persistent freshening trend in simulations with anthropogenic forcing is due to a combination of shallow model mixed layers and elevated model wind stress, precipitation and Tasman inflow. \r\n\r\nThe modified conclusion described above emphasizes the dependence of our understanding of climate variability on direct ocean observations, as well as the benefits of extensive numerical experimentations. With the latter in mind, we propose to analyse the multi-model dataset to be collected for the IPCC AR4,  our objective being to quantify internal variability of SAMW and its response to anthropogenic forcing. We shall evaluate each of the climate models in terms of ocean heat transport and the large scale ocean circulation as in Jia (2003), as well as the SAMW properties. Based on this initial evaluation, we shall select a subset of the models for a detailed investigation of the nature of the SAMW variability using control experiments and experiments with different forcing scenarios.

Cai (2004) proposed that part of the large amplitude climate warmings in high latitudes can be explained by the so-called “dynamical amplifier” mechanism. The dynamical amplifier mechanism requires a net increase of poleward heat transport due to an increase of greenhouse gases. Such an enhanced poleward heat transport must imply that an increase in net radiation energy surplus (deficit) in low- (high-) latitudes. Therefore, one can deduce the high-latitude surface warmings due to the dynamical amplifier feedback from the change of deficit (surplus) of the net radiation flux at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). It should be emphasized here that one would not be able to identify such a change in the net radiation flux at the TOA if the amplified warmings in high latitudes were caused by local thermodynamic feedbacks (e.g., ice-albedo feedback) only.\r\n\r\nThe radiation energy budget at the TOA can be used to directly address if the poleward heat transport has been intensified or not. We are planning to carry out the budget analysis using the ERA40 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, and climate simulations produced by various centers available at the PCMDI website.

To reduce these uncertainties, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology established two comprehensive datasets of the worldwide measured surface radiative fluxes, the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA, Gilgen et al. 1998), and the database of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN, Ohmura et al. 1999). These datasets have been widely used in the past for the assessments of surface radiation fields in climate models. In this project we intend to use these observational datasets for the evaluation of the new coupled model simulations carried out for the IPC 4th assessment report.  Expertise for this work has inter alia been gained in the  AMIPII diagnostic project No, 32 surface and atmospheric radiation budgets in AMIP II GCMs. In addition to the assessment of the model performances under present day conditions, we intend to analyze the future evolution of the surface radiative fluxes. A particular focus will be on the longwave downward radiation, which we consider as a key quantity amongst the surface energy balance components under changing climates (Wild and Ohmura, GEWEX news, 14 (4), 2004). The longterm monitoring of the longwave downward radiation is also a major aim of the BSRN programme. Finally we are interested in the evolution of the downward solar radiation at the surface, since we have been heavily involved in the analysis of decadal changes of this quantitiy, related to the issue of solar dimming versus solar brightening.','2004-12-15','Beate G.

In addition, it may also change the volume of water which outcrops at the surface in the polar latitudes, changing the pathways of water formation and tracer cycling.  As the surface warms and/or freshens and certain isopycnals cease to outcrop, tracers along these isopycnals will be isolated from the surface and sequestered in the ocean on time scales shorter than diffusive time scales, but this may also limit the future capacity of tracer uptake at the surface.

A closed circulation connects the EM with the Asian Monsoon, AM, (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996), and a weaker one resembles a Hadley circulation across eastern North Africa (Ziv et al. 2004). \r\nAir back-trajectories demonstrate that the EM is connected at the lower-troposphere with Europe, at the mid-troposphere with eastern North Africa and at the higher-troposphere with the AM (Ziv et al. 2004), who also found that the two competing dynamic factors are correlated with each other, and attributed this to the linkage between them and the AM. Accordingly, an intensification of the AM enhances both the subsidence, via the circulation connecting them, and the Etesian winds, due to the enhanced pressure gradient between the two regions. The above implies that the AM prevent each of this factor to dominate, so that it has a moderating effect on the EM summer regime.\r\n\r\nSaaroni et al. (2003) found a significant warming, combined with intensification of extreme heat waves, over the EM along 1948-2003.

An improved understanding of the processes that set the frequency and amplitude of El Niño events is a key element underpinning the development of climate prediction on seasonal and longer timescales. Also imperative is a better understanding of how the processes critical to El Niño are represented in coupled climate models, and how systematic biases in  modelled climate may impact upon them. Errors in the simulation of El Niño have been cited in the IPCC AR3 as a major source of uncertainty in projections of future climate change. \r\n\r\nBy swaping ocean and atmosphere components in coupled GCMs, recent work has shown that the atmosphere component has a dominant role in defining El Niño frequency and base amplitude (Guilyardi et al. 2004). In particular, higher atmosphere resolution dramatically improves the low frequency spectra of El Niño. Even though this emphasis may be due to shortcomings in present-day atmosphere GCMs, more work is needed to elucidate the reasons behind this result.\r\n\r\nThe IPCC AR4 coupled simulations database provides a unique opportunity to further document this issue in the most recent coupled GCMs of the community.

Together with the direct radiative effect, volcanic forcing affects circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere shifting the Arctic Oscillation (AO) toward a positive phase.  The duration of the forcing for each particular eruption is about 2 years.  We propose to evaluate how the IPCC models simulate global and regional volcanic impacts on climate during historic period since 1860 to 2000.\r\n\r\nThe global average cooling of the climate system caused by volcanic aerosol is statistically stable however both observed and simulated responses have to be cleaned from ENSO to make fair comparison.  The regional responses to individual (even strongest) eruptions , both caused by radiative cooling and change of circulation, are very difficult to evaluate because the observed signal is contaminated by climate variability.\r\n\r\nTherefore in this study we propose to conduct a composite analysis of 12 strongest volcanic eruptions since 1860 to 2000 discussed in [Robock and Mao, 1992].  We combine these eruption in the 3 groups because different type of eruptions caused different climate effects:\r\n1. Equatorial eruption that produced volcanic cloud in both hemispheres – 6 eruptions\r\n2. SH eruptions that produced plume in the SH – 3 eruptions\r\n3. High-latitude NH eruptions with plume in the NH – 3 eruptions\r\n\r\nFor all models we will analyze summer and winter responses for 2 years following the volcanic eruptions and compare results with corresponding composites from observations.  The different ENSO phase in simulations and observations could negatively affect comparison but a composite averaging should diminish this effect.  The composite analysis will provide more reliable evaluation with observations than analysis of the individual cases.  We will analyze surface air temperature, sea level pressure, 50 hPa geopotential height, and temperature at 50 hPa.  Only surface air temperature could be evaluated with observations from the Climatic Research Unit for entire period since 1860 to 2000.

While TC activity has been well observed in the satellite era (1970s to present), counting and characterization of cyclones in climate model solutions is more difficult due mainly to coarse spatial resolution of the models. An alternative to direct measurements is to use an index based on atmospheric parameters that have strong observational and physical linkages to TC formation.\r\n\r\nOne such index is the “seasonal genesis parameter” proposed by Gray (1979) and refined by Royer et al. (1998). This index has two factors, one accounting for the dynamical controls of vertical wind shear and low-level vorticity, and the other the thermodynamic source of TC energy including upper-layer ocean heat content, mid-tropospheric moisture and low-level moist static energy. The innovation of Royer et al. was to use model convective precipitation for the thermodynamic factor and to scale the convective precipitation so as to produce current-climate (observed) TC activity. Thus, the Royer-style index can measure slow changes in TC activity if we assume that the physics of the relationship between the dynamical/thermodynamic controls–TC activity varies at a much slower rate than the climate temporal scales of interest. For interannual, decadal variations and century-scale trends it seems unlikely that underlying physics would change so that if over-ocean tropical convection increased in a warmer climate, then TC activity would increase if the dynamical parameters remained constant.\r\n\r\nTC activity in the IPCC AR4 coupled model simulations will be analyzed using the Royer scheme for three scenarios: 1) present climate control (pdcntrl); 2) climate of the 20th century (20c3m); and 3) 1%/year CO2 increase to doubling (1pctto2x). TC activity will first be analyzed using the mean annual cycle of a 30-y period for the control and the current climate to determine the convective precipitation scale factor. We will also use total precipitation and the ratio of convective/total precipitation from reanalysis to determine sensitivity to the thermodynamic part of the index. The second phase will consider climate variations in the index, specifically interannual, decadal and century trends using filters.\r\n\r\nThe date requirements are relatively modest: 1) monthly means; 2) atmospheric variables of 850 and 200 hPa winds (ua,va; dynamics), convective and/or total precipitation (prc and pr; thermodynamics). The Royer scheme has been implemented and tested for the NCEP R1 & R2 and the ECMWF ERA-40 reanalyses.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nGray W.M., 1979: ‘Hurricanes: their formation, structure and likely role in the tropical circulation’ in Shaw.

This is ascribed to a combination of increased temperature and potential evaporation that is not balanced by increases of precipitation. However, in most cases, precipitation over adjacent mountainous regions is more important for the hydrological condition of the arid/semi-arid regions than that falls to the arid/semi-arid regions. Therefore I am investigating the impact of global warming to the local hydrological condition of the northern part of China and Turkey, the two contrastive semi-arid regions in the mid-continental areas of the Eurasian continent. I have already collected more than 1000 stations of precipitation data over northern part of China and that of more than 300 stations for Turkey. Using these data with satellite information and ERA40 dataset, I am developing a statistical downscaling method in order to apply it to the GCM outputs of the SRES scenario runs. During the process, first we are making daily grid precipitation data with including orographic effect for China for 40 years (Xie, Ming and Yatagai, 2003,http://www.chikyu.ac.jp/yris/newsletters.html). Comparison of precipitation of GCM control runs with this kind of quantified gridded precipitation data should be important to assess the performance of GCMS for the semi-arid regions environment. Then apply statistical relationship between atmospheric circulation, especially for moisture transport, and precipitation over the mountains adjacent to the arid/semi-arid regions of Eurasia. Finally, I compare the hydrological budget (precipitation, evapotranspiration, etc) for the regions. Now I request to use GCM outputs of the scenario (100 years of A2 and B2 scenarios) with control runs, and apply the method to the outputs. It should be useful to compare the performance of the models to assess the impact of the global warming over arid/semi-arid regions. \r\n','2004-08-26','',1,''),(255,286,'Evaluating the Tonla Sap lake model, particularly','Delsenius','Helena','kurshd@misu.su.se','46-708-624244','','MISU','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(256,287,'Comparing global and U.S. surface temperature in historical runs with observations','Knutson','Thomas','Tom.Knutson@noaa.gov','1-609-452-6509','','National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration','We are interested in comparing global and U.S. surface temperature timeseries in the historical runs of various models with observations.

The role I would like to play in the collaboration with climate modelers is to compare proxy climate reconstructions and climate models for the purpose of inter-validation and calibration. On one hand climate modeling can be used to evaluate a climate reconstruction. On the other hand, a reconstructed temperature history and the empirical estimates of the climate response to external forcing terms can be used to tune climate models. In my most recent paper (Huang, 2004, GRL, 31, doi:10.1029/2004GL019781) I merge the long-term information preserved in the global database of borehole temperatures (Huang et al., 2000, Nature, 403, 756-758), the 20th century meteorological record (Jones et al., 1999, Rev. Geophys. 37, 173-199), and an annually resolved multi proxy model (Mann et al., 1999, GRL, 26, 759-62) for an integrated reconstruction of the Northern Hemisphere temperature change over the past five centuries. The integrated reconstruction suggests that the 20th century warming is a continuation of a long-term warming started before industrialization. However, the warming has been substantially accelerated since the onset of industrialization. The integration of the three bodies of information greatly improves the relationship between the reconstructed temperatures and the radiative forcing history. The good agreement between the integrated reconstruction and the forcing model confirms that there are both natural and anthropogenic factors in the recent warming. It also allows for an independent estimate of the rate of climate-forcing response.

Global Circulation Models (GCM) have been used to assess the impacts of greenhouse gases on climate change study for the last three decades. While useful, many studies have highlighted considerable uncertainties due to its coarse spatial resolution over global grids. There are also large precipitation errors which lead to significant problems for local impact studies. A number of studies suggest that climate downscaling using a nested dynamic model will provide further refinement of coarse scale GCM output simulate these local impacts. Here we consider the dynamic downscaling of climate data using the Pennsylvania State University / National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR) mesoscale model, known as MM5. This model allows choices of cumulus parameterization, boundary layer schemes and convection schemes. The model domain consists of a mother domain centered at 54o N and 98o W which covers a large portion of the Canadian prairies with two inner domains at successive downscaled resolutions to 10 Km. To date, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data has been used for initial and boundary conditions to setup the model and run simulations. The model results are compared with ground observation station data and impacts on transportation infrastructure.\r\n\r\nNow, to develop climate change scenarios, GCM climate data is required to force the boundary conditions for the next run.','2005-03-11','',1,''),(313,353,'Probio','laborbe','renaud','renaud@cptec.inpe.br','[55]-[12]-3186-8464','','cptec','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(315,355,'Tropical Precipitation change','Holloway','Chris','chollow@atmos.ucla.edu','310-206-5641','','UCLA','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(316,356,'global hydroclimates','swenson','sean','swensosc@colorado.edu','303-492-0463','','University of colorado','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(317,357,'Global Hydroclimates','Wahr','John','wahr@lemond.colorado.edu','(1)-303-492-8349','','University of Colorado','','0000-00-00','',0,''),(318,358,'Changes in the frequency and intensity of North Atlantic Extra-tropical Cyclones under future climate change','Hanson','Clair','c.hanson@uea.ac.uk','44-1603-592721','','University of East Anglia','There are two main objects to this exercise.

The most comprehensive tools for simulating past and future climates influenced by WMGHGs are fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs). Because of the importance of WMGHGs as forcing agents, it is essential that GCMs compute the radiative forcing by these gases as accurately as possible. We present the results of an intercomparison between the forcings computed by GCMs and by benchmark line-by-line (LBL) radiative transfer codes. The comparison is focused on forcing by CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, and the increased H2O expected in warmer climates. The models participating in the intercomparison include representatives from many of the modeling groups participating in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4) and from a number of the principal groups developing LBL codes.  The results indicate that there are still substantial discrepancies between GCMs and LBL models for forcings by CH4, N2O, and CO2.

We specifically propose to extract from CMIP model runs a) individual high-magnitude wind events and b) indicators of background windfield strength and direction. These regions are sensitive to erosive activity in part due to wind-driven wave activity. Coastal erosion places infrastructure and habitat at risk. Recent trends suggest that increasing wind fetch due to sea-ice margin retreat, as well as lengthening ice-free seasons, act to increase the erosive power of wave activity and the length of time for wave attack to occur. High-magnitude wind events are the most effective agent of coastal change. It is important to determine if these occurrences are likely to change in frequency or intensity into the future.

Sea-level pressure from the models is projected onto the observed modes to ensure that a standardized analysis is performed by comparing to a common metric.

The analysis emphasizes air-sea interactions associated with ocean meanders in the eastward extensions of major western boundary current systems such as the Gulf Stream, Agulhas, and Kuroshio Currents.  Satellite observations of wind stress from the SeaWinds scatterometer on QuikSCAT and sea surface temperatures from AMSR clearly indicate the influence of SST on surface wind stress on scales smaller than about 30 of longitude by 10 of latitude. Spatially high pass filtered SST and wind stress variations are linearly related, with higher SST associated with higher wind stress.  The influence of SST on wind stress is also clearly identifiable in the ECMWF operational forecast model, \r\nhaving a grid resolution of 0.35 x 0.35 degrees (T511). The coupling coefficient between wind stress and SST, as indicated by the slope of the linear least squares fit, is only half as strong as for satellite observations, however.\r\n\r\nThe ability to simulate realistic air-sea interactions is present to varying degrees in the coupled climate models we examine. The MIROC 3-2-HIRES (1.1 x 1.1, T106) and the NCAR CCSM3.0 (1.4 x 1.4, T85) are the highest resolution models considered and produce the most realistic air-sea coupling associated with midlatitude current systems. Coupling coefficients between SST and wind stress in the MIROC3-2-HIRES and NCAR models are at least comparable to those in the ECMWF operational model. The spatial scales of midlatitude SST variations and SST-induced wind perturbations in the MIROC 3-2-HIRES model are comparable to those of satellite observations. The spatial scales of SST variability in the NCAR model are larger than those in the ECMWF model and satellite observations, and hence the spatial scales of SST-induced perturbations in the wind fields are larger.\r\n\r\nWe find that the ability of climate models to simulate air-sea interactions degrades with decreasing grid resolution.  SST anomalies in the GFDL CM2.0 (2.0 x 2.5), UKMO HadCM3 (2.5 x 3.8), and MIROC 3-2-MEDRES (2.8 x 2.8, T42) models have larger spatial scales and are more geographically confined than in the higher resolution models. The GISS Model E-R (4.0 x 5.0) is unable to resolve the midlatitude ocean eddies that produce prominent air-sea interaction.  Notably, the MIROC 3-2-MEDRES model exhibits much weaker coupling between wind stress and SST than the higher vertical and horizontal resolution version of the same model. The GFDL CM2.0 and UKMO HadCM3 models exhibit a linear relationship between SST and wind stress. However, coupling coefficients for the UKMO model are significantly weaker than in the GFDL and higher resolution models. In addition to model grid resolution (both vertical and horizontal), deficiencies in the parameterization of boundary layer processes may be responsible for some of these differences in air-sea coupling between models and observations.','2004-09-01','Eric Maloney',1,''),(411,0,'Comparing model estimates of sea-level rise and ocean heat uptake with observations','Church','John','John.Church@csiro.au','','','Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation','We have recently completed a new estimate of monthly sea-level distributions from January 1950 to December 2000 (Church et al., 2004).

Ensembles of model projections are gathered (the multi-model “ensemble of opportunity”) or designed (the “perturbed physics ensemble”) and individual ensemble members are given different weights according to some measure of their credibility or reliability. The ensemble members and their relative weights are then combined to produce a probability density function (PDF) of future climate change (here we use the term PDF as an umbrella term for quantities such as the frequency histogram, cumulative density function etc.). Results may be displayed graphically or, as is common, quoted in terms of an average measure together with a 5-95% uncertainty range.\r\n\r\nPDFs are thought to be useful to both policy makers and scientists but care must be taken in their production and interpretation. No method exists which can quantify all the uncertainties in climate change predictions (models, scenarios, unrepresented feedbacks etc.) hence it must be made clear what uncertainties are accounted for. Also a number of different methods exist for generating PDFs and results can be sensitive to those choices. The sensitivity to methods, in particular what the PDF is constrained by and what it is conditional upon should be investigated and clearly stated.\r\n\r\nSpace has already been set aside in the AR4 for the inclusion of probabilistic measures of global and large-scale regional variables (section 10.6 of chapter 10 and the corresponding section of chapter 11).

For temperature, a detection analysis for moderately extreme temperature (occurring once or several times a year) is presently underway, using fingerprints from CGCM2. Presently, we use an index based on percentile exceedances (based on revised observational indices, see Zhang et al., 2004), and additionally the index of the most extreme day of the year (see Hegerl et al., 2004).

A multi-model ensemble of simulations of 20th century climate change will provide a  fingerprint of changes in temperature extremes from the late 20th century. Additionally, fingerprints from individual models can be compared. For precipitation extremes, a detection approach using observations is presently not feasible  due to differences in scale between station data observations and model data. Therefore we limit the analysis of precipitation extremes to comparing future changes in extreme rainfall between model simulations, to distinguish where models show consistent changes in mean and extreme rainfall, and where changes are inconsistent between models. This is to be done similar to the comparison in Hegerl et al., (2004). \r\n\r\nThis analyses uses similar data as the Kharin et al. project, but focus instead on intermediately extreme events (occurring once or several times per year) rather than on 20-year return values.

Two down-scaling techniques have used larger scale features to more accurately capture the trend (Charles et al. 1999a, Timbal 2004). The rainfall decline is also shown by the decrease in synoptic types associated with wet conditions (Hope 2004).

Thus the migration fish with the long passive larval stage such as Japanese eel is largely exerted on by the effect of physical dispersion bringing about large early decrease of their population.\r\n\r\nIn case of the Japanese eel which is a representative species whose spawning grounds is far away from the nursery grounds, it is thought that some of them having searched more efficient transport processes for survival generate a present migration system adapted to the current system from tens thousands or hundreds thousands years. Thus the roles of currents for the differentiation and the dispersion of species are very significant and the present migration path from the spawning ground to the nursery ground will not change if the currents are steady state. However, oceanic structures including the present currents system not only have fluctuated seasonally/inter-annually but also have been affected by ocean-climate changes such as the El Niño with some years scale and a decadal regime shift. Not only the larval transport paths but also the spawning behavior of the adults has been varied according to these fluctuations of the oceanic structures, which also have caused the fluctuation of fisheries resources. \r\n\r\nFisheries resources of Japanese eels, and Atlantic eels, which are a closely related species and habitats in the Atlantic, have decreased since around 1975 when showed a peak of catches. An ocean-climate change with the earth scale known as climate regime shift occurred in 1975. After that, El Niño have happened in the short run term, and on a long term basis the position of salinity front closely related to the spawning behavior of Japanese eel have gradually shifted to the north. Spawning area of Japanese eel is located in the North Equatorial Current west of Mariana Islands as shown in Fig. 1 (Tsukamoto, 1992). They are firstly transported from the North Equatorial Current (NEC) region and then to the coast of Japan by the Kuroshio from near the Luzon Strait (Fig. 1) (Kimura et al., 1994). The positions of salinity front, considered as an indicator of spawning behavior of Japanese eel, due to the NEC are affected by the occurrence of the El Nino events (Kimura et al., 2001), and the fluctuation of the NEC dominates the success and failure of larval transport.\r\n \r\nTherefore, Firstly, we have to understand the generation properties of Ocean-Climate changes in the Pacific and the Atlantic using several statistics data, and then getting hold of the changes of oceanic structures in the two oceans when these ocean-climate changes, particular El Niño and non- El Niño events. the output from the IPCC simulations is thought to provide us with many imformations of climate changes in the scale of the Pacific.','2004-09-01','',1,''),(434,0,'Mean-meridional circulation and Eliassen-Palm flux','Kodama','Chihiro','kodamail@wind.geophys.tohoku.ac.jp','','','Tohoku University','We are interested in the troposphere-stratosphere coupling and its sensitivity to global warmings.

The suggestion for a climate trend can be easily rendered when examining only a portion of such low frequency swings, when in fact no drift is occurring. A new attribution challenge exists in today’s climate system however, where atmospheric chemistry is known to be changing due to human activity, and true climate trends are anticipated.   On regional scales, differentiating the intrinsic low frequency variations from ones that are forced is a key to knowing whether climate is indeed veering toward a new direction.  Beyond the policy-relevance of such knowledge, and its societal value, there also exist immediate consequences for operational long-lead climate predictions. The practice of seasonal climate prediction at the Climate Prediction Center includes utilization of US trends (generally the past 30-years) in surface temperature and precipitation through a method referred to as Optimal Climate Normal. The skill of seasonal predictions of US surface temperature, based on trend information alone, have proven comparable to predictors that have characteristic interannual variability, such as ENSO.  Despite the success of observed climate trend information in seasonal predictions, understanding the causes for such variability from the observed data alone remains poor. Are such trends merely part of atmospheric internal variability, or can the trends be attributed to an external forcing?  To the extent that a forcing has been important, is it manifest as the direct and local response to increasing greenhouse gases, or are the non-local feedbacks associated with the ocean’s response to increasing greenhouse gases also important?   A more complete understanding can be gained from the analysis of model simulations for the 20th century where the climate, including its low frequency statistical fluctuations is compared with similar runs where the observed evolution of external forcing is specified.  Analysis for simulations from more than one model is also essential to gain confidence in validity of conclusions.  The focus of this proposal, therefore, will be analysis of differences in atmospheric trends between control simulations and 20th century simulations to year 2000, and to analyze their relationships with the observed trends.\r\n\r\nData Sets Required:  Analysis will rely on monthly mean fields from three sets of simulations:  (1) 100 year (minimum) control run, and (2) 20th century AMIP simulations to year 2000 forced with observed SSTs and observed climate forcing, and (3) 20th century coupled simulations with observed climate forcing.

It has a large impact on the weather and climate of the North Atlantic ocean and the surrounding landmasses by influencing temperature, wind and precipitation patterns (e.g. Hurrell, 1995), and as such controls drought or flood conditions, the trajectory and strength of storms, and heat waves and cold spells, especially over Europe. It additionally interacts with the ocean and may influence the Thermohaline Circulation (THC) in the North Atlantic (Hurrel et al., 2003) as well as the position of the Gulf Stream. NAO has a life cycle of approximately two weeks and is driven by the interaction of baroclinic synoptic and planetary waves (Feldstein, 2003). Several studies (e. g. Baldwin and Dunkerton, 2001) show that the polarity of the NAO index in winter depends on the state of the stratospheric polar vortex. Wind anomalies associated with the strength of the polar vortex extend to the upper troposphere (Christiansen, 2003). Upper tropospheric wind shear influences the preferred area of growth of baroclinic eddies and, therefore, of storm tracks. Hence, changes in polar vortex regimes over time will lead to changes in the variability structure of the NAO (Perlwitz et al., 2000). Walter and Graf (2005) made clear that these structural changes are due to shifts in the weights of contributing dynamical processes in the atmosphere and that the changes involve storm tracks and precipitation and their correlation with the NAO index. Potentially this will also involve changes in the effectiveness and patterns of ocean-atmosphere interaction on a basin wide scale (Graf and Walter, 2005).\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of crucial importance for the scientific community to be able to predict the short- and long-term variability of the NAO. However, the Earth\'s atmosphere and oceans constitute a coupled system with a large number of interactions and feedbacks. The underlying processes are portrayed with different accuracy and weight in different atmospheric, oceanic and coupled circulation models that would allow for the prediction of future climate conditions. This leads to differences in the forecasts of ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (OAGCMs) for an increasing greenhouse gas burden. Many of these differences may be related to differences in the atmospheric part of the coupled models, others may be due to biases at the interface between atmosphere and ocean. Very recently, Osborn (2004) showed that the current coupled OAGCMs exhibit only weak similarity with observed NAO/AO patterns. Only if the mean of the models\' first EOFs is computed, a structure similar to the observed NAO evolves. However, the amplitudes then are much smaller than observed. Reasons for this unsatisfying behaviour remain unknown.\r\n\r\nWith this project I propose to study in detail the ability of coupled OAGCMs to reproduce the dynamics of atmospheric internal variability structures and their sensitivities to external forcing (e.g. Increasing GHG burden or volcanic eruptions). By investigating the mechanisms behind the dominant atmospheric variability mode in the North Atlantic area (the NAO) both in observations (reanalysis data for the years 1958-2003) and in models (control runs and GHG forced runs from CMIP, see http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip) I want to uncover basic controlling processes for ocean-atmosphere coupling and their changing weight in the past and future. By comparison of these processes between the \"real world\" and the \"model world(s)\" I shall\r\nbe able to assess the level of trustworthiness of different OAGCMs and their potential to forecast future climates. At the same time I may be able to interpret the causes of failure of some of the models to reproduce the observed past. I finally will investigate processes that lead to transitions of regimes of the stratospheric polar vortex on a seasonal to (multi)decadal time scale, which might have contributed to (multi) decadal variability in the efficiency of ocean atmosphere coupling and teleconnectivity.\r\n\r\nMethodology/work plan\r\nThe project is broken into 3 work packages. Atmospheric data consisting of approximately four decades of daily 3-D grid values of geopotential heights, wind vectors, temperatures etc. will be obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Centre (ERA40) and from the NOAA web page (NCEP reanalysis). Analysis tools will be developed with these data and can then be applied to the model data. I will study in detail the ability of coupled OAGCMs from CMIP as well as the Hamburg ECHAM5 model to reproduce the dynamics of internal patterns of variability and their sensitivities to external forcing. Since differences in the probability density functions of the index time series of the fundamental atmospheric variability modes (between different models and between models and reanalysis data) can be expected, I will document these and derive respective wind stress fields, freshwater and heat fluxes. All investigations will be based on daily data, if necessary after application of numerical filters. I will start with reanalysis data and apply the developed methodology therein to model data as these are received. Finally I will investigate if I can detect regimes of variability of the polar vortex strength (Feser et al., 2000) in the control runs of the coupled models considered, and study the cause of transitions between different multi-decadal regimes and their impact on global teleconnections (Walter and Graf, 2002).\r\n\r\n1st year:\r\nAcquire reanalysis data, develop of dynamic analysis tools, analyse polar vortex regimes, define new NAOlike indices, analyse time series (reanalysis data)\r\n\r\n2nd year:\r\nDetermine mechanisms of build-up and decay of NAO-like variability in reanalysis data for different stratospheric regimes (reanalysis data)\r\nAnalyse polar vortex regimes, define new NAO-like indices, and produce associated patterns, time series analysis of model data, start to search for causes of stratospheric regime transitions (intra-seasonal) and forced by GHG in reanalysis and model data (model data)\r\n\r\n3rd year:\r\nDetermine mechanisms of build-up and decay of NAO-like variability in models, model-model and modelreanalysis intercomparison (model data) Study mechanisms of global/regional regime transitions (multi-decadal) in control and GHG forced model run (model data)\r\n\r\nLiterature\r\nBaldwin, M.P., and T.J.

PV and PT of air particle are slowly transformed only due to the influence of irreversible factors  (diabatic influxes of heat and friction). Consequently,  some functionals based on adiabatic invariants may be considered as useful indices of climatic changes. The following two functionals are  proposed in investigation of the climate variability in Northern and Southern Hepisphere: .the  first functional is  the air mass distribution on PV and PT values which gives direct insight on the changes of vortex and thermal statement of atmosphere; the second functional  follows from  fundamental freedom existing in Ertel\'s general definition of PV. It gives the possibility to introduce a novel invariant measure q which is an \"optimal\" modified PV in definition of which enters a monotonic increasing function r of potential temperature. This measure is preserved in idealized climate processes, when external diabatic heating and frictional forcing, being applied to zonally-oriented infinitely thin (q,r)-tubes (formed at the expense of intersection between iso-scalar surfaces q=const and r=const), annihilate each other. A reference stationary air mass distribution on (q, r)-values, introduced for both hemispheres separately, does not depend on r. This distribution is characterized by exponentially decaying function of the absolute value of q and has the same total amount of \"PV substance\" (atmospheric vorticity charge) as the actual atmospheric state. Comparisons of the monthly-mean air mass distribution on q for modern climate  with this for various future scenarios  give the valuable information on different reply of two hemispheres on climate forcing and will enable to quantify a degree of non-equilibrium of the real atmospheric climate processes, with respect to the introduced invariant measure.\r\n\r\nModel data required: Daily data of: temperature, zonal and meridional wind, geopotential on all available levels, sea level pressure in different model scenarios.','2004-08-29','',1,''),(450,0,'Subsurface temperatures and air temperatures coupled at decadal and centennial time scales','Pollack','Henry N.','hpollack@umich.edu','','','University of Michigan','My interest is in the computational quantities sometimes referred to as the \"ground surface temperature\", \"shallow soil temperature\", and \"deep soil temperature\".

The characteristics examined include mean spatial patterns, seasonal, year-to-year and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and the diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially MRI-CGCM2.3.2a, produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. Most models do not simulate well the distribution of mean total cloud amount including marine stratus clouds, with the HadCM3 and HadGEM1 severely underestimating cloud cover over most of the globe. Most models, especially the GFDL and UKMO models, GISS-AOM and PCM, produce too much convective (over 95% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low-latitudes, in contrast to 45-65% in the TRMM satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to deficiencies in model-simulated ENSO amplitudes: the standard deviation of ENSO SST indices increases with tropical convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm/day), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (>20 mm/day) precipitation and overestimate them for light (<10 mm/day) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm/day category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America has intensity comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm/day) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models.

The models show that the changes induced in the dynamics of the climate system by the anthropogenic increase of the CO2 affects the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the cryosphere (in particular the amount of mass in the polar ice sheet and the sub polar glaciers). Variations of the global circulation and the mass repartition at the Earth\'s surface induce significant changes to be observed with geodetic techniques. In particular, the gravity field, as measured for instance by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, is directly sensitive to the mass repartition at the Earth surface. The Earth rotation rate is rather sensitive to the global zonal circulation in the atmosphere and in the ocean. The shape of the Earth, as measured by the deformation of global scale network of GPS (and soon Galileo) stations, is also perturbed by the variable mass repartition at the Earth surface.  Those quantities are measured by geodesists with an incredible precision: the variation of the Earth orientation in space, and thus its rotation, are measured at the sub-centimeter level. The geoid, derived from gravity field, is measured at the millimetre level, and a millimetric position can be achieved for the station position. The geodesy can thus be a useful tool to study global scale changes in the climate system. It has several advantages with \"classical\" climatic observation: \r\n\r\n(1) it is global, and can thus test the results where only few observational data are available, \r\n(2) it is very precise, for instance GRACE is able to \"feel\" a 1mm of water anomaly over a few hundred kilometer scales, \r\n(3) it is independent, as it does not use any of the data that have been, so far, assimilated in atmospheric or climate models. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to test what would be the consequences on the geodetic observables of the expected changes in the climate system induced by the CO2 increase, as predicted by the different coupled models.

It is that projection of future climate change by climate models (e.g. difference between 1XCO2 and 2XCO2 climates) is more significant than prediction of future climate itself by the models (IPCC 2001).

The first part of this involved developing a new tropical cyclone genesis index, which predicts the space-time probability of storm formation given monthly mean environmental kinematic and thermodynamic conditions.  This index works very well in the present climate for predicting the spatial, seasonal and interannual variability of storm genesis. Once we calculate this index, we generate a very large number of synthetic storm tracks by first making random draws from the genesis PDFs and then marching the tracks forward assuming that the storms move with a weighted vertical average of the environmental flow plus a constant correction for beta drift. The environmental flow is also synthesized using Fourier time series with random phase, but which have the same monthly means, variances and covariances as the NCEP re-analysis data. Finally, a simple but accurate coupled deterministic hurricane intensity model is run along each track, and output from this is used to assess wind speed probabilities. The statistics of the tracks and the wind speeds compare extremely well with historical hurricane data. Details of this technique are described in an article accepted for publication in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\r\n\r\nI would like to extend this technique to predict hurricane activity in future climates by using GCM output to calculate the hurricane potential intensity (needed by the deterministic model), the genesis PDFs, and the monthly means, variances and covariances of global winds to synthesize hurricane tracks.

Most models suggest substantial warming over much of North America, including the West. Models indicate a likely acceleration of continental warming over the 21st century and an intensification of the hydrological cycle (IPCC 2001). Even without changes in precipitation, such warming would have major implications for western water management. Improved climate-change projections on regional scales are urgently needed for the benefit of those who deal with water resources (Lewis et al. 2003).

Our results show that mean annual temperature in the last two decades of the 20th century has been increasing at a rate of 0.6 deg C/10 yr. This rate of warming is nearly twice the mean rate of warming (0.3 deg.C/10 yr) that calculated for China.  Analysis of seasonal trends also indicate that since the early 1970s summer and winter mean temperatures have increased as well as a general decreasing trend in summer precipitation.  The banning of fire in the alpine, instituted to prevent the accidental burning subalpine forests, and changes in grazing patterns have contributed to the advance of sapling trees and shrubs into alpine meadows.  Clearly, two spatially and temporally distant anthropogenic disturbances, a rapidly warming climate and changes in land use, appear to be affecting alpine glaciers and upper treeline vegetation dynamics, thus threatening both biodiversity and Tibetan livelihoods in the Hengduan Mountains of northwestern Yunnan China.

We are using simulation results from the MC1 dynamic vegetation model (2 km cell size) and output from various state-of-the-art climate models to show how future climate may further alter these alpine ecosystems.

Although there is agreement in the scientific community that there will be an increase in flooding and droughts, there is very little consensus as to how much precipitation will increase or where floods and droughts will occur.  Floods due to hurricanes such as Katrina are expected in low lying coastal areas prone to hurricanes but the locations of floods due to extreme rainfall events are not as easy to predict.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to model and predict such phenomena, scientists have employed a variety of Global Circulation Models (GCMs).

The only global visualization of annual mean precipitation change put forth in the 2001 IPCC working group 1 report was a multi-model average, which could actually obscure the individual predictions rather than pointing out their differences.  To illustrate the disagreement between models, examine the figure above.  Four different models were used to assess how soil moisture would change according to IPCC Scenario A2.  Scenario A2 assumes global CO2 levels will approach 1000 ppm by the year 2100. The figure shows the change in summer soil moisture between the last half of the 21st century, compared to the last half of the 20th century.  In some places the results are similar; in others they differ among the models. The \"q-flux\" models have specified ocean heat transports whereas the “dynamic” model allows ocean dynamical transports to change.  Note that the scales change; the models on the left (ranges from -50 cm to +50 cm on left and -5 cm to +5 cm on right) include soil moisture below rooting depth.  Therefore they have greater absolute values of soil moisture. As we can\'t see down to those levels, we don\'t know how wrong or right they are. Understanding the reasons behind the similarities and differences among these models, as well as others else where, is essential for better prediction.\r\n\r\nI am interested in exploring how and why current GCMs differ in their precipitation predictions.  I will attempt to understand the differences between models by analyzing the hydrologic changes -- precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and runoff -- from the two GISS simulations used in the upcoming 2007 IPCC report, as well as other in-house GISS models of varying climate sensitivity and physics.  With this data, I will then alter the GISS GCM in a controlled manner, and see if the pattern of hydrologic change can be predicted. From there, I will analyze similar output from the other GCMs in the IPCC database to identify tendencies induced by the model physics, or by biases in various models including GISS.  The biases will be determined by comparison with hydrologic (and radiative) observations of the current day climate, including output from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES). To the extent that the forecast hydrologic change depends upon the physics or biases in each model, it will allow us to better constrain predictions of future hydrologic changes.  As a graduate student at Columbia University, I have access to the NASA/GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) GCM and many of its contributors, making me uniquely equipped to carry out this research.\r\n\r\nAs policy-makers continue to consult scientists on issues of global warming, how will the scientific community respond?  If areas at high risk for flooding and drought could be identified, scientists, water use managers, and policy makers could work together to protect endangered areas or populations, averting future catastrophes.  Even if climatologists do not always come to the same conclusions on future climate, there is a rising need for comparative analysis of GCMs to understand why scientists disagree.','2005-11-15','',1,''),(601,0,'Climate Change Over India in the IPCC AR4 Simulations','Ashrit','Raghavendra','raghu@ncmrwf.gov.in','','','National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, India','The Assessment Report No 4 (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, documents the actual knowledge on the state and the change of global and regional climate. The Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (CAOGCM) climate change simulations are available for various scenarios of greenhouse gas (GHG) and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions. The simulations can be characterized as (1) Reconstruction of an \"undisturbed\" pre&#151;industrial climate (2) Climate change experiments forced with observed atmospheric greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations since the middle of the 19th century (3) Scenario experiments of climate change based on different assumptions on future greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations (4) CO2 sensitivity experiments (1% per year increase). The new simulations show a mean global warming between 2.5 and 4.1 degrees Celsius until the end of this century - dependent on how much greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. One of the consequences: the seasonal varying sea ice decreases - the arctic could become ice free during late summer when the emissions will not be reduced.\r\n\r\nClimate over the Indian region is dominated by the monsoon rainfall during June- September. While the monsoon rainfall averaged over India shows no long term trend, the strong interannual variability results in extreme flood/drought conditions. Extreme flood/drought conditions in this region of over a billion often lead to catastrophe. Several of the earlier studies using CAOGCM climate change simulations have shown that in a warmer future climate scenario corresponding to late 21st century, Indian monsoon rainfall (IMR) shows an increase of over 10% relative to the 20th century climatology. This increase in rainfall is accompanied by enhanced strength of monsoon circulation due to enhanced warming of the Eurasian continent. The scenarios also indicate increase in the variability of the monsoon rainfall which would mean an increase in the frequency of extreme flood/drought years. This study examines these aspects of impact of global warming on the regional climate over India with special emphasis on the IMR and its interannual variability.','2005-12-19','',1,''),(602,0,'Climate Change and Extreme Rainfall-related Surface Runoff Risks in Ontario','Cheng','Chad Shouquan','','','','Meteorological Service of Canada','The purpose of the proposed study is to estimate possible changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall, surface runoff and flooding risks in the 21st century for several pilot watersheds in Ontario.  \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are to determine the impacts of future climate change on the frequency and magnitude of rainfall, surface runoff and flooding risks in Ontario, by comparing frequencies and characteristics of weather types from the historical period (1958-2000) with projected weather types from downscaled GCM projections for three-time windows (2010-2029, 2040-59 and 2070-2089) in the 21st century.

It is linked with the increasing trend of daily rainfall amounts due to the increased atmospheric water vapor and increasing trend of the surface temperature. The Global Circulation Models (GCM) are used as a tool to simulate climate changes in rainfall and temperatures in response to anthropogenic greenhouse forcing. In previous studies, preliminary evaluation of GCM, over the eastern Mediterranean region was used as an input for estimating changes in local processes affecting the water balance in the region. (Segal et.al, 1994) \r\n\r\nRecent studies of rainfall trends in the Mediterranean basin, have pointed on a paradoxical increase of ex­treme rainfall in spite of decrease in the totals, as shown by Alpert et al., 2002, for stations in Italy and Spain. This trend was observed over most parts of Israel excluding the south- central and south,  (the semi- arid zone) which show an opposite trend of increase in totals rainfall amounts. The exception of the semi- arid Israeli belt from the regional trend was linked to the effect of large modifications in land use, partly resulting from the connection of southern Israel to the national water carrier in 1964, Ben-Gai, et. al., (1993, 1998). Furthermore, a positive link was found between land use changes and the enhancement of thermal convection and induced rainfall. (Perlin & Alpert, 2001) Another explanation is the increase in the frequency of sub-tropical anti-cyclones, particularly over the western and central Mediterranean (Alpert et al., 2002), and according to NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for the period 1958 – 1998, a southward transition of low-pressure anomalies in the second half of the 20th century over the eastern Mediterranean. During the 90’s a center of low-pressure anomaly moved over southern Israel. \r\nA very recent study has shown the increasing of red sea trough events, which affect the rainfall events in the southern part of Israel. (Alpert et al, 2002)\r\n\r\nTemperature analysis of Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 40 stations in Israel revealed that the frequency of occurrence of extreme temperature events, with lower winter and higher summer temperatures, has increased. (Ben-Gai et al, 1999) Both observations and modeling studies results indicate fewer rainy days and extreme rainfall and temperatures events possibly as a result of global warming. \r\n\r\nDue to its location bordering the semi arid zone and encompassing opposite rainfall trends in its northern to southern parts, Israel represents a complex and exceptional climate change behavior. Therefore, we wish to study the results of several GCMs, to investigate their ability to simulate the climate over the eastern Mediterranean region and to analyze the simulated greenhouse gas induced changes in temperature and precipitation in this area.

For the models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), this weakening shows a significant dependence on the initial THC strength: it is stronger for initially strong overturning. We propose a physical mechanism for this phenomenon based on an analysis of additional simulations with the coupled climate models CLIMBER-2 and CLIMBER-3alpha. The mechanism is based on the fact that sea ice cover greatly reduces heat loss from the ocean. The extent of sea ice is determined mainly by the near surface atmospheric temperature (SAT) in the North Atlantic but \r\nalso by the strength of the THC itself which transports heat to the convection \r\nsites. Initially larger sea-ice cover responds more strongly to atmospheric warming, thus sea ice retreats more strongly for an initially weaker THC. This sea ice retreat provides a stabilising feedback on the THC, and this stabilising feedback is stronger for an initially weaker THC, thus making it weaken less in climate model simulations.','2006-03-28','J.

One of those factors, which also influence stability properties of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, is net energy dissipation rates in the ocean.\r\n\r\nTo quantify those dissipation rates, one can consider the damping (decay) timescale for the thermocline anomalies associated with the large-scale oceanic motion. Fedorov (2006) explored these ideas in an oceanic GCM using the analyses of the ocean energetics  conducted by Goddard and Philander (2000). He found that the damping rate was dependent upon the frequency range. In the interannual frequency range, he found a damping of (2.3 years)-1, similar to the values used in the original Cane and Zebiak (1987) model. In the near annual frequency sub-range, the damping had larger values of about (7 months)-1. \r\n\r\nFedorov’s analysis was limited to an ocean-only model forced with observed monthly winds. The low temporal resolution of the windstress smoothed out the effect of important ENSO forcing features such as westerly wind bursts. We will firstly explore Fedorov’s analysis technique using coupled model data, to see if there is a difference between coupled models and ocean-only models, and also whether increased temporal resolution leads to significantly different outcomes. Having weekly data, as opposed to monthly, will also allow us to improve the resolution of the analysis for high frequency events.  Further, we will explore this problem by comparing damping rates in different coupled models.

This is especially relevant for naturally guided sectors of economy as hydro-electricity, agriculture, forestry, transportation, tourism/recreation, and fishery. The role of a climate is strengthening by that fact that many natural parameters are climatically stipulated. In this respect, climate is a natural Climatic Resource [CR] determining potential opportunities and headway of any region. The natural energy CR include water- and wind power. The transportation, tourism/recreation CR include temperature and precipitation, duration of cold and warm season, etc. \r\n\r\nThe CR are affected by the Global Climate Change [GCC]  depending from regional geography and environmental characteristics. Recognition of the CR variability is necessary for the development of appropriate adaptation strategies to achieve environmental/economic balance for sustainable development of any particular area. Such recognition requires reliable short- and long time climate projecting.\r\n\r\nThis project will be used to predict changes in temperature, daily solar radiation, duration of winter/summer seasons, precipitation, humidity, wind velocity, etc., within the East European Plane.  Data of climate simulation can be used to predict sustainability of CR.  For a variable area as the East European Plane Region, a one-size-fits-all approach is unsuitable, yet sub-regional-scale information on climate change is not readily available. Not only there is a scientific need to understand regional climate change, there also is a economical one. If a balance between the economy and the environment is sought, this balance must be optimised sub-regionally, in the environmental and economical interest. Our proposed project is the tool that can make this optimisation possible, for one particular sub-region in Europe, while laying the framework for optimisation elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the project aims to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of the GCC on public health in the region based on the predicted parameter changes, and suggests possible mitigation strategies in terms of their practical application.

These biases occur despite robust observed relationships between the large scale circulation and regional precipitation (e.g. the monsoon circulation, or relationships with ENSO variability).  We intend to investigate the feasibility of using empirical downscaling models (EDMs; e.g. Widmann et al., 2003) to \r\ndebias and downscale regional precipitation over Indonesia and the Maritime Continent.

While society is faced with global warming due to increase in greenhouse gases, an issue that is not well understood is how the \r\nstorm tracks may change. Shifts in the location of the storm tracks, or changes in the storm track activity, can lead to droughts or floods, and affect the frequency of occurrence of severe weather, and is therefore one of the most important factors governing regional climate change. In addition, these storms are responsible for transporting huge amounts of heat, moisture, and momentum, hence changes in the storm tracks can also lead to changes in the global circulation.\r\n\r\nWhile storm track changes are present in GCM simulations of global warming, few studies have been conducted to examine them in detail since previous generations of GCMs have poor simulations of storm tracks. With improvements in physical parameterizations as well as increase in model resolution, the current generation of GCMs does a much better job in simulating the climatological distribution of storm tracks. However, to date no detailed validation of how well storm track variability is simulated by GCMs has been conducted, making it impossible to assess how reliable GCM predicted storm track changes are. \r\n\r\nIn this project, GCM simulations of storm tracks and their variability and change will be assessed in detail, using a suite of diagnostic and modeling studies. The main goals are to quantitatively assess whether deficiencies in GCM storm track simulations could give rise to deficiencies in the GCMs prediction of how the storm tracks may change, and to achieve quantitative understanding of GCM predictions of storm track changes under global warming. Results from this project will enable the scientific community to assess the uncertainties present in such predictions.\r\n\r\nIn this project, GCM simulations of storm track variability will be compared in detail to observed storm track variability. Apart from statistical assessment of the fidelity of GCM simulated storm track variations, several prominent modes of storm track variability will be examined in detail. While there are other projects that focus on studying how storm track may change under various global warming scenarios, the novelty of this project is in the use of a combination of linear and nonlinear storm track and stationary wave models to quantitatively assess whether deficiencies in GCM simulations are of dynamical significance. In addition, dynamical models having various levels of complexity will also be employed to quantitatively understand and relate GCM predicted storm track and mean flow changes.

This would affect the monsoonic systems that characterize the summer rainfall in extensive  tropical and subtropical regions. Moreover,  if the strength of large scale and synoptic waves becomes affected at mid-latitudes,  it would decrease the transport of heat from the tropics to mid-latitudes and the westward transport of momentum. This ultimately might affect the strength of the trade winds and would therefore cause alterations to the climate not only in the tropics but across the planet. the winter climate is highly influenced by the activity of mid-latitude waves. The so-called \"nortes\" are the result of these waves interacting with lower latitudes.

Hence, a knowledge of how African rainfall variability relates to natural variability and how this relationship is simulated by coupled models, the prime tools for projections of climate change, is one prerequisite for climate change adaptation on the continent. An anomalous SST pattern, associated with summer rainfall extremes over southern Africa, has been observed in this section of the Indian Ocean.  Experiments carried out using the HadAM3 model have shown this anomalous SST gradient in the southwest Indian Ocean to produce a large atmospheric circulation response over southern Africa.  We have found that this pattern is also a leading mode of rainfall-related SST variability in the southwest Indian Ocean in a coupled model - the HadCM3 1000-year simulation.  We have investigated the evolution of the SST anomaly pattern through a range of atmospheric and oceanic variables in the model. We plan to use the AR4 data to carry out a systematic examination of southwest Indian Ocean SST variability in coupled models to discover what modes of rainfall-related SST variability exist, and how these evolve, now and in the future.

USAID’s Famine Early Warning System Network’s livelihood baseline system provides an opportunity to determine the vulnerability of food systems in West Africa to future climate changes.  Using the increased information on the food and income sources for three economic groups in Niger as a case study, the vulnerability of the food systems to potential climate changes in West Africa will be assessed.  By focusing on the potential changes in the food systems in the region in the next century, we can identify actions that organizations with decision support systems with food security and food systems at their center, such as FEWS NET and AGHRYMET, can take to modify the risks to the population.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study of 18 coupled model simulations from global models included in the analysis for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report, only three had a reasonable representation of the West African atmosphere and monsoon system during the past few decades(Cook & Vizy 2005).  Precipitation, circulation and interannual variability were examined for all models to identify those with a reasonable ability to simulate past climate, in order to determine which may have believable simulations of possible future climate dynamics in the 21st century.  65 model integrations were examined from the 18 coupled GCM’s.  Three models were selected: MIROC_MED, MRI and GFDL_0.  These models had very different scenarios for the future for West Africa.  The GFDL model had a very negative picture, resulting from a large off-shore winds from the Atlantic eventually  the reversal of the monsoon flow, disrupting the ability of the monsoon to bring rain to the Sahel.  The MIROC_MED model accentuated the moisture flow, resulting in a very positive picture for West Africa,  with a large increase in moisture.  The third (which Cook and Vizy consider by far the most likely of the models examined) was the MRI model produced a situation where increasing CO2 levels created increasing periods of drought and variability through the period,  without any large changes in overall moisture to the region.\r\n\r\nThese scenarios will be assessed using simulated rainfall and vegetation dynamic information from matching the inter-annual dynamics seen during the past twenty-five years to the model dynamics, then extending the ‘potential’ vegetation and rainfall to 2100 using the model anomalies shown above.  These will be the input to the socio-economic analysis framework described below.\r\n\r\nUsing newly available information on the ways people make a living in Africa, the study will evaluate the impact on three economic groups (poor,  and better off) possible future changes in climate.  Recent research has provided a way to couple local food prices and environmental variability (Brown et al. 2006),  permitting a rough measure of future price variability in the underdeveloped regions of Niger to be coupled with models of environmental change.  By varying the amount of food produced and food access in the markets, an index of basic food security for each economic group and livelihood zone in Niger can be obtained by year to parallel variations in rainfall from the GCM scenarios.','2006-09-15','',1,''),(748,0,'SOAP','Brohan','Philip','philip.brohan@metoffice.gov.uk','','','Hadley Centre','Comparison of all-forcings model runs with instrumental and proxy-based observations of the surface air temperature.','2006-09-15','',1,''),(749,0,'Examining Potential Changes in African Moisture Transports and Precipitation','Funk','Chris','chris@geog.ucsb.edu','','','University of California, Santa Barbara','I am a geographer/climatologist within the Climate Hazard Group (CHG) at UC Santa Barbara.

Salient examples of this work involve analysis of the recent drought in Eastern Africa, and mid-season prognoses of the 2002/03 and 2003/04 growing seasons in Southern Africa. We are presently working with partners within the Famine Early Warning System Network to develop analytic frameworks for evaluating the potential food security impacts of multi-year droughts.\r\n\r\nWe have three specific questions: i) what are the potential changes in on-shore moisture transports into Africa,  ii) what are the potential changes in upper atmospheric circulation patterns,  and iii) what might these changes imply for African rainfall,  especially during the heart of the growing season in the most vulnerable sub-Saharan countries. We are concerned that warming in the tropical Indian and Atlantic oceans may tend to reduce or redirect moisture transports,  while weakening the upper level easterlies typically associated with strong convection. Access to the IPCC simulations will allow us to examine these hypotheses  and link these circulation changes to potential variations in precipitation.

One such method is by looking at diagnostic relationships between large scale parameters and TC formation.  One example of this being the seasonal genesis parameters (SGP) as proposed by Gray (1975),  which allows for a geographical repartitioning of the seasonal frequency of TC formation,  given current climate condition.  The six parameters are divided between dynamical factors (coriolis,  low level vorticity and vertical wind shear) and thermodynamic factors (moist static stability,  mid-tropospheric moisture and upper ocean temperature).

The objective of this project is to evaluate the similiarity between the spatial structures of the model-simulated responses to El Niño and global warming. Variables, such as precipitation, surface temperature, surface pressure, winds, cloud cover, and soil moisture will be examined over the tropics. Linear regression of these variables against an ENSO index (e.g., Nino-3 SST) will be used to describe the spatial patterns of change associated with ENSO for each model. These results will use the 20C3M archive of model output. The resulting regression patterns will be normalized and ensemble-averaged across multiple models to provide a \"consensus pattern\" of ENSO change. These patterns of ENSO-induced change will be compared to that arising from increased greenhouse gases using the SRES A1b scenario runs for the period 2000-2100.  Instead of using regressing against Nino-3 index, we will compute the spatial pattern of the linear trend in the\r\nabove variables per degree global warming.

In spite of the arguable success of this approach, it is based on underlying assumptions (unimodality and linearity) that do not universally apply to the climate system.  We are working on an alternate formulation of climate based on information theory.  In this picture of climate the basic quantity for quantifying variability is the Shannon Entropy (SE) and the basic measure of association is the Mutual Information (MI).  These quantities both have solid, useful connotations for discrete variables.   For continuous variables, however, the SE is ill-defined, possibly taking on negative or infinite values, but the MI is a well-defined and reliable quantity.  Thus, the problem for continuous systems becomes one of finding a surrogate for the SE to quantify variability, and we have identified a number of candidate quantities.\r\n \r\nThe application for access to IPCC AR4 output is driven by an interest in applying these concepts to a large number of model output data sets.  \r\n \r\nWe will begin by studying discretized variables (e.g., cloud amount expressed in octas or tenths), where we can compute both the SE and MI with confidence, using these metrics to quantify both spatial and temporal variability.  Where possible, we will use SE and MI to quantify relative strengths in relationships between climate variables.  We will do this for a wide variety of model output sets, and thus will be doing an intercomparison in the process.  We will also apply the SE and MI to model data prepared (through intermesh interpolation) in a form that will allow 1) direct intermodel comparisons using information theory and 2) an assessment of the overall amount of information the models share (also called “redundancy”).\r\n \r\nThe application of information theory to continuous variables will be pursued as described above.  Since the SE is not always well defined for continuous variables, we will experiment with various approaches to 1) discretizing the continuous data and then computing the SE and MI, and 2) using alternatives to the SE to calibrate the MI for use in model variability studies and model intercomparison.\r\n \r\nThe expected outcomes of this work are 1) a set of results applying information-theoretic principles to assess climate variability, 2) a more general approach identify the existence of relationships among climate variables, and 3) a distinctly different and more general approach to model intercomparison.

It has turned out that the IOD has a large impact on climate of both the surrounding and remote regions such as East Asia, Europe, and South America (Yamagata et al. 2004).  Thus, understanding as well as simulating the IOD is crucial to global climate research.\r\n\r\nRecently, Ashok et al. (2001) have shown that the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is not correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in recent decades owing to the frequent occurrences of the IOD.  Behera and Yamagata (2003) have revealed that the IOD even weakens the link between El Niño and the Southern Oscillation through influencing the pressure at Darwin.  Since the seminal work by Nitta and Yamada (1989), the decadal variability in the tropical Pacific has been studied extensively in recent decades.  However, the decadal phenomenon in the tropical Indian Ocean has received little attention, partly owing to lack of available observational data.  \r\n\r\nAmong a few studies, Meehl et al. (1998) and Allan et al. (2003) discussed a link with the decadal ENSO-like variability in the Pacific.  Also, Reason et al. (1996a) suggested the importance of decadal variability in the subtropical anticyclone in the southern Indian Ocean, while Reason et al. (1996b) showed that the decadal variability in the winds over the Pacific may introduce decadal variations in the southern Indian Ocean via the Indonesian Throughflow.  More recently, Tozuka et al. (2006) have revealed, using SINTEX-F1 coupled GCM, that the decadal modulation of the interannual IOD events is associated with that of the southward Ekman heat transport across 15°S induced by changes in the Mascarene High (Reason et al. 1996).  They have also shown that the heat transport by the Indonesian Throughflow associated with the ENSO (Meyers 1996) is a major factor that explains the decadal modulation.\r\n\r\nUsing the IPCC model outputs, we plan to investigate the decadal variation in the tropical Indian Ocean.  In particular, we investigate how and why the occurrence of simulated Indian Ocean Dipole varies decadally using both atmospheric data (such as OLR, wind stress, and rainfall), and oceanic data (such as temperature and current fields).\r\n\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(962,0,'Arctic Climate Variability','Jungclaus','Johann','johann.jungclaus@zmaw.de','','','Max- Planck-Institute for Meteorology','With focus on the control and 20th century integrations the natural variability of the Arctic region (incl. sea ice) and its relation to the oceanic (meridional overturning) and atmospheric heat transports shall be investigated to complement an ongoing study with the ECHAM5/MPIOM results available here in Hamburg and earlier studies carried out at MPI-M.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(963,0,'MsC Thesis','Lawley','Peter','pjlawley@yahoo.co.uk','','','University of East London','Thesis for MsC Advanced Architectural and Energy Studies, University of East London/ Centre for Alternative Technology, UK.

This decline was accompanied by significant change in patterns of the Arctic atmospheric circulation, resulting in longer summer melt seasons, greater intrusions of warm Atlantic water, and different trajectories of ice motion. Interannual distributions of multi-year ice have exhibited high variability during the past two decades, especially in peripheral seas surrounding the central Arctic basin.\r\n\r\nAssessing variability of the Arctic sea ice habitats in conditions of climate change based on multisensor satellite observations provides important information for improving our understanding of Arctic marine ecosystems. Recent and dramatic changes in sea ice and melt conditions have been observed in the Western Arctic, which in turn affect the sea ice habitats of marine mammals and other ecosystem components.  Studies suggest that wind anomalies over the Bering Sea play a dominant role in the year-to-year ice variations. For the thermodynamic mechanism, winds may contribute to anomalous sea ice formations via heat flux anomalies.  Northerly winds bring cold and dry air onto the Bering Sea, which enhances the ocean-to-atmosphere heat fluxes, and in turn which can result in greater ice formations. This project will help elucidate the principal mechanisms that affect age and thickness distributions of Arctic sea ice, and provide useful information for improving predictive models of sea ice conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project will study:\r\n\r\n1)  variability in sea ice concentrations, age structure and thickness distributions, the dates of melt onset, and rates of melting in the Bering and Chukchi Seas in 1979-2006, \r\n\r\n2)  effects of variability in the dates of the melt onset on patterns of ice seal reproduction and molt, \r\n\r\n3)  long term trends in ice parameters and melting events in the Bering and Chukchi Seas and their influence on Arctic marine ecosystems, and  \r\n\r\n4)  models of sea ice extent to evaluate the probabilities of the Bering and Chukchi Seas becoming ice-free in future decades.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(967,0,'Cool Tongue','Wu','Chunqiang','wucq@mail.iap.ac.cn','','','Institute of Atmospheric Physics','','2007-07-25','',1,''),(968,0,'The Impact of Climate Change on Tropical Cyclone Genesis','Fu','Bing','bingf@hawaii.edu','','','MET/SOEST/University of Hawaii','Currently, a lot of debates exist related to global warming/climate change.

Using long-run climate change predictions from the Hadley 2 Model, the preferred estimates indicate that climate change will lead to a $1.3 billion (2002$) or 4.0% increase in annual profits. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -$0.5 billion to $3.1 billion and the impact is robust to a wide variety of specification checks, so large negative or positive effects are unlikely. There is considerable heterogeneity in the effect across the country with California~s predicted impact equal to -$0.75 billion (or nearly 15% of state agricultural profits). Further, the analysis indicates that the predicted increases in temperature and precipitation will have virtually no effect on yields among the most important crops, which suggest that the small effect on profits are not due to short-run price increases. The paper also implements the hedonic approach that is predominant in the previous literature and finds that it may be unreliable, because it produces estimates of the effect of climate change that are extremely sensitive to seemingly minor decisions about the appropriate control variables, sample and weighting.

Since most of the winter snow pack tends to fall during a small number of storms, monthly and seasonally averaged climate statistics are not relevant. The goal of this study is to examine whether proxy synoptic indicators for the intensity of winter storms can be defined that will be less sensitive to the models’ physical parameterizations of boundary layer processes in mountainous regions. \r\n\r\nThe first proxy to be tested will be daily 700 hPa temperature. 700 hPa temperature in numerical weather prediction models is used extensively by operational weather forecasters to assess whether precipitation in the valleys of the Intermountain West will fall as snow or rain. For mountain ranges such as the Utah Wasatch with peaks near 700 hPa, relatively warm 700 hPa temperature (near 0oC) during a storm cycle tends to be associated with higher water content. Obviously, using only mid-tropospheric temperature will not indicate whether precipitation is actually falling in the actual or simulated atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which present climate simulations reproduce the probability density distribution of 700 mb temperature during the winter season in the western United States as deduced from radiosonde observations will be examined. Then, similar probability density distributions will be developed from GCM simulations using future climate scenarios (carbon dioxide doubling, etc.). After corrections for model biases, the utility of this and other synoptic proxies for inferring sensitivity of winter storm intensity to climate change scenarios will be addressed.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1169,0,'AICC','Lazo','Emilio','ovlazo@yahoo.com','','','Ceaza','In my project I want to generate scenarios of impact of the climate for the Elqi River Basin.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1170,0,'Statistical Bayesian Modeling of Multi-Model Climate Simulations','Johannesson','Gardar','gardar@llnl.gov','','','LLNL','Investigate simple Bayesian statistical models to combine multiple model-outputs to generate propabilistic future climate predictions.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1171,0,'Course Research','Pittman','James','jinbman@gmail.com','','','Prescott College','Researching potential use of this software for a course I am teaching.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1172,0,'Consequencias de cambios climaticos globales','Halvorsen','Kjetil','kjetil1001@gmail.com','','','Vice-ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible, Bolivia','Statistical downscaling of GCM output for the areas of Titicaca and vallegrande, Bolivia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the GCM output data, we use NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and observational data from SENAMHI, The national institute of Meteorology and Hydrology in Bolivia.\r\n\r\nDownscaling is implemented using the R package clim.pact by Rasmus Benestad.\r\n\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1173,0,'Uncertainty in forest landscape respose to climate change','Xu','Chonggang','xu4@uiuc.edu','','','University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign','We coupled a forest landscape model LANDIS-II and a forest process model PnET-II), we attempts to examine the variability/uncertainty of a transitional forest landscape (Boundary Water Canoe Area (BWCA), which is transitional between spruce-fir dominated boreal forest and pine-dominated mixed forest) response to climatic change resulted from the differential responses of 14 tree species under different climatic change scenarios.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1174,0,'CLASSIC','Taylor','Christopher','cmt@ceh.ac.uk','','','Centre for Ecology and Hydrology','My research is focused on land-atmosphere interactions, and in particular, how soil moisture affects the atmosphere via sensible and latent heat fluxes.

The most striking climate change is the rapid regional warming at the Antarctic Peninsular. At Faraday/Vernadsky station in the western Antarctic Peninsular, surface air temperature exhibits a startling mean annual warming rate of 2.8°C over the last 50 years, contrasting the global mean warming rate of 0.5°C during the same period. It represents the highest rate of warming observed anywhere on earth. In responding to this warming, sea ice in the Southeast Pacific shows a significant decreasing trend, even though the sea ice extent over the entire Southern Ocean has a slightly increasing trend.  In the last 25 years, modern instrumental data reveal that the changes in El Niño/Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode influence the sea ice variability in this region but cannot fully explain the trend in the Southeast Pacific sea ice extent. What caused this dramatic regional warming, and associated sea ice reduction, as well as the collapse of ice shelves around the peninsula is still an open question. We suspect that other climate modes in the Southern Ocean and/or combinations of different modes may play roles in this regional warming. Variability and interaction of different climate modes at longer timescales may also be important in this climate change. \r\n\r\nWe would like to examine the decadal variability in a number of major climate modes in the Southern Hemisphere from 100-150 years of coupled climate model runs. The Southern Annular Mode, marked by zonally-symmetric but out-of-phase pressure anomalies between mid and high latitudes, is a dominant climate mode throughout the Southern Hemisphere. This climate mode impacts the sea ice field, particularly in the South Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean. The Semi-annual oscillation describes another zonally-symmetric mode in the southern extra-tropics, which is characterized by the twice-yearly enhancement in meridional gradients of temperature and pressure fields. The atmospheric convergence line with a strong half-year cycle exerts significant influences on the seasonal asymmetric behavior of ice extent: a slow advance equatorward in winter and a fast retreat in summer. The Pacific South America pattern represents an atmospheric wave train in the pressure field over the South Pacific and South America. This mode is highly related to ENSO variability at the tropics and plays a critical role in the formation of the Antarctic Dipole, the largest interannual variability in sea ice and surface temperature in the Antarctic subpolar regions.\r\n\r\nThese climate modes collectively dominate the climate variability in the Southern Ocean. We have examined the relationships of these modes with sea ice based on the last 25 years of observations and have a good understanding of the influence from each mode on the sea ice field. The proposed study will extend our current study to longer periods from model runs, which will enable us to examine the climate variability at decadal and longer time scales, and their contributions to sea ice changes. The key objective is to isolate the unique combination of these modes that can cause a significant warming trend in the west Antarctic.\r\n\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1197,0,'A Preliminary Study on the Impacts of Climate Change','Lam','Joseph','bcexem@cityu.edu.hk','','','City University of Hong Kong','It is generally believed that our climate is changing and that the average temperatures will probably increase over the next few decades. What is less clear is “how would temperature rise affect the designs and energy performance of buildings”? Buildings account for a significant part of total energy use, up to nearly half in developed countries. In China, building stocks accounted for about 30% of the total primary energy requirement in early 2000s and, with rapid economic growth and improvements in the living standards, would continue to be a major energy end-user. Buildings last for 50 years or more. A good understanding of the impacts of climate change on the built environment is essential in the design and analysis of energy-efficient buildings, if these buildings are to maintain good thermal and energy performance well into the middle or even later half of this century. This work is to investigate the effects of temperature rise on the designs of buildings in different climate zones in China. Particular attention will be given to passive design strategies such as passive solar heating, natural ventilation, thermal mass and evaporative cooling. The findings would help architects and engineers make a more informed decision, especially during the initial conceptual design stage.\r\n\r\nIn China, there are five major climatic types - severe cold, cold, hot summer & cold winter, mild, and hot summer & warm winter. Because of the varying topology, there are nine regions – both the severe cold and cold climates have three regions. To strike a balance between keeping the analysis manageable and achieving a broad representation of the prevailing climate types in China, a total of 18 cities are selected for this study - five in the severe cold climate region, four cold, five hot summer & cold winter, one mild and three hot summer & warm winter. The criteria of selection are based on:\r\n\r\n1) Cities must have local meteorological stations and measured weather data such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, etc. are available.\r\n\r\n2) Cities selected should cover the major climatic types/categories identified, and have a reasonably even geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nTemperature has a direct impact on the thermal and energy performance of buildings, emphasis, therefore, will be on the availability of monthly temperature data (mean, minimum and maximum). The grid-box covering each of the 18 cities will be determined (initially, we would consider the 70o-140oE & 15o-55oN, the East Asia region data). Grid-box variables output from different GCMs will be downloaded and compared. Direct comparison may not be possible because these models tend to have different spatial/horizontal resolutions and varying modeling/prediction time-frames. The grid-box/grid-point data will be interpolated to achieve the predictions for the 18 cities using statistical method (e.g. Gradient plus Inverse-Distance-Squared). For each city, the interpolated data (mainly mean monthly mean, minimum and maximum dry-bulb temperatures) will be used to determine the 12 monthly climatic lines for the bioclimatic analysis of major design strategies. These will be compared with the bioclimatic design charts based on 30-year (1971-2000) long-term observed weather data. Impact on the potential of passive design strategies (e.g. passive solar heating and natural ventilation) will be assessed. We will try to quantify the impact with the likely changes in passive design potentials. For instance, passive solar design potential in Beijing is about 25% (i.e. 25% of the colder half of the year October-March, no conventional space heating will be required if proper passive solar design is adopted), temperature rise could increase the passive solar potential. Likewise, passive cooling design potential using natural ventilation and thermal mass techniques in Shanghai could be reduced due to warmer weather and more frequent extreme temperatures during the hot summer period. Due consideration will be given to the adaptive issue when constructing comfort zones on the bioclimatic charts.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1198,0,'Mechanisms and impacts of the diurnal cycle of clouds','Nesbitt','Steve','snesbitt@uiuc.edu','','','UIUC','We will be analyzing the representation of the diurnal cycle by the coupled models using the 3 hourly output from the IPCC simulations in preparation of a preproposal for the DoE ARM request for proposals.\r\n\r\nWe will examine the performance of general circulation models in simulating the diurnal cycle of convection and radiative forcing in the TWP using DoE ARM above synthesis datasets.

A better understanding of the processes has emerged from the above observational studies and it has become clear that these large amplitude multidecadal fluctuations confound the calculation of climate trends. Separating the MDV and the anthropogenic influence on climate is essential for making future predictions. \r\n\r\nIn this project we propose to investigate the role of multidecadal variability and anthropogenic trends in IPCC CMIPIII models in the Arctic-North Atlantic Sector. Our observational analysis has revealed some intriguing relationships between the North Atlantic Oscillation and key climate parameters (Polyakova et al. 2006) in an attempt to understand why the NAO paradigm does not always operate. We have analyzed various simulations of the CCSM3 for multidecadal (Sterling, 2006) variability and propose to next analyze additional models from CMIPIII. This would provide us a better measure of which processes are well reproduced by current state-of-the-art models and strengths in one model would permit us to better understand the mechanisms behind what we see in observations. \r\n\r\nWe propose to begin the analysis using 20th Century and control simulations.

Based on the surface energy budget, the sea surface temperature (SST) variance is related to the product of three factors: the sum of the variances of surface radiative and turbulent energy fluxes and of ocean heat transport, an efficiency factor depending on the covariances among them, and a transfer factor involving the persistence of surface temperature via its lagged autocorrelation (Yu and Boer, 2006, Clim. Dyn). These quantities have been analyzed based on results from the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and a simulation with the CCCma coupled climate model. It is found that the geographical distribution of the SST variance follows that of the sum of the variances of surface heat fluxes and the ocean heat transport, but modified by the defined efficiency and transfer factors.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the SST and heat flux anomalies is complex and model dependent (e.g., WCRP, 2000).

The remotely sensed data driven Fire Threat Model (FTM) developed within this project provides a basis for spatially explicit quantitative assessment of likelihood of wildland fire occurrence, its impact and recovery potential for a given resource.  This model is intended for use by resource managers to assist them in assessing current levels of fire threat to a given resource, projecting the changes in fire threat under the changing climate and land use and evaluating the efficiency of various management approaches aimed at minimizing the fire impact.  During its first phase the project focused on evaluating the risk of ignition using MODIS active fire product.  Unlike fire behavior fire ignition is often connected with economic and cultural aspects of human presence as well as climatic conditions. The risk of ignition in the Russian Far East is highly variable in spatial and temporal domains and is strongly linked to anthropogenic activity (transportation routes, settlements and land use).  However, there is also an indication that during the largest fire seasons natural sources of ignition also contribute to increased fire occurrence.  In the next phases analyses leading to proper parameterization for the FTM will be undertaken to evaluate potential fire behavior, fire impact on the tiger, and the area’s rehabilitation potential through remotely sensed data.

Gregory et al. (2005) suggests that surface heat fluxes are more responsible for the weakening of the thermohaline circulation than freshwater fluxes in a given set of climate models.  Understanding the predictability of the ocean and related changes to climate is tightly coupled to our understanding of the uncertainties associated with the processes in the atmosphere and the ocean of which ocean mixing and heat uptake are significant.  One metric, used in understanding the fundamental behavior of a climate model, is called the \"effective climate sensitivity\" and is defined as the equilibrium warming that would be expected based on model behavior at the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling.  Tightly related to this quantity is a metric that is used to understand a climate model~s ability to take up heat, the \"ocean heat uptake efficiency\" or ?, (Gregory and Mitchell 1997, Raper et al. 2002).  As these papers describe the relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean, the near surface air temperature change (??a?) relates to the net heat flux such that ?Q + ???a  = ?F, where ?Q is the net heat flux, ?  is the percentage of heat contributing to the atmospheric warming and ?F is the flux into the ocean. ?F can further be defined as d?H/dt.  ?H is the heat content change of the ocean and is equal to ???a, where ? is a coefficient related to the percentage of heat flux being added to the ocean the \"ocean heat uptake efficiency\" coefficient.  Thus ?Q = (? ? ?)??a.  The key objective of this proposal is to quantify ?  using observational data and compare it to similar quantities computed from AOGCMs to understand how its variability and spatial distribution influences the thermohaline circulation.\r\n\r\nWhile for climate studies the efficiency rate is used to understand the long term changes of the ocean and atmosphere that are associated with CO2 doubling; it could also be used as a measure to quantify the realism associated with heat uptake during 20th century runs of the current generation of climate models.   This research will be to calculate  quantities of ocean heat uptake efficiency from a set of the current generation IPCC AR4 models and simulations and evaluate their realism and the associated uncertainty in the uptake rates and compare the values to observational estimates.\r\n\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1338,0,'Possible impacts of climate change in Mexico','Becerra','Francisco','davidmz@atmosfera.unam.mx','','','UNAM','It is a project to evaluate the vulnerability of the corn agriculture in the of south Mexico into the climate change scenarios; the escenarios are to be regionalizated in other research at unam.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1339,0,'Climate Dynamics','Hanson','Lawson','l.hanson@bom.gov.au','','','Bureau of Meteorology, BMRC','Download data for scientists working in the Climate Dynamics Group of BMRC, at Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1340,0,'ENSEMBLES','Ding','Hui','hding@ifm-geomar.de','','','IFM-GEOMAR','Seasonal forecasts.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1341,0,'Blocking & low-frequency modes','Barnes','Elizabeth','e.a.barnes@reading.ac.uk','','','University of Reading','We will explore the relationships between low-frequency modes such as the NAO and PNA and blocking.

Results indicate that the effects of increased temperatures outweigh precipitation increases and are the dominant contribution toward negative monthly snowfall trends throughout the snowfall season in southern locations in the region of interest. The same mechanism is present during the fall and spring transition seasons at more northern regions, with the exception of mid-winter where increases in precipitation translate into positive monthly snowfall trends. Examination of 24-hour snowfall events in the northern regions reveals the coexistence of increasing numbers of large (> 20 cm) events and decreasing annual snowfall totals, thus indicating that precipitation increases at higher latitudes contribute to the possibility of larger snowfall events where it is sufficiently cold.

Here, we investigate how world water resources stress will likely change under scenarios presented by the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) with integrating the water withdrawal projections presented in the first part of this study. First, potential changes in water availability are investigated using a multi-model analysis of the ensemble outputs of six general circulation models (GCMs) from worldwide organisations. The analysis suggests that although climate warming might create greater availability of water resources, the amplitude of water resource change varies widely in some regions depending on the GCM used. The change predicted by the models was consistent for boreal regions of northern Canada and Siberia and tropical areas near the Equator. In most of Europe, the eastern U.S., and parts of South America, the six GCMs suggest significant to subtle changes in runoff. However, a significant decreasing trend in runoff due to climate warming is forecast for southern Europe. For other regions, the model results show large uncertainty in change amplitudes and even directions. Second, we investigated water-stressed basins, the number of people living in highly water-stressed basins, and changes in these categories using two indices (W/Q and Q/c) at the basin scale. Indices Q/c and W/Q indicate that approximately 1.75 billion and 2.53 billion people, respectively, currently live in highly water-stressed basins. These numbers will increase in the future and possibly double by the 2050s according to SRES scenarios A1b, A2, and B1. Finally, we examined the relative impacts of population growth, water use change, and climate warming on world water resources using the world highly water-stressed population as an overall indicator. The results suggest that population growth and socioeconomic development are the major causes of increasing stress on world water resources. Climate warming could mitigate world water stress to a limited extent. However, even though climate warming may create greater water availability, many basins worldwide will likely continue to experience water stress. Therefore, water use efficiency must be improved globally to reduce the net water withdrawal. A comparison of the world water-stressed population amongst different projections was also conducted in this paper.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1361,0,'Climate change and hydropower','Luo','Bin','bluo@hydro.mb.ca','','','Manitoba Hydro','To examine the impacts of climate change on hydroelectric resource planning.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1362,0,'Heat-health analysis','Greene','Scott','jgreene@ou.edu','','','University of Oklahoma','Examination of heat waves in the future, and comparison with historical heat/health relationships.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1363,0,'Analysis of climate model winds at B.C. offshore winds','Pal','Badal','badal.pal@ec.gc.ca','','','CCCMA','This project will examine projected 21st century changes in near-surface winds over the NE Pacific Ocean as represented by the WCRP CMIP3 multi-model ensemble.

To ensure effective implementation of a transnational climate policy, the global framework has to be complemented by regional frameworks against the backdrop of little incentives for the developing nations to participate actively in the global climate protection regime with binding commitment.\r\n\r\nEast Asia faces the challenge of incentive setting. Countries in the region have experienced extraordinary economic growth in the recent decades, and this rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasing energy consumption and environmental damages. In the meantime the impact of climate change has become visible. In the course of the current regionalisation in this area, the co-operation towards climate protection is now one of the central issues. Given these reasons, we lay regional focus on East Asian nations in this paper primarily concerning the roles of China, Korea and Japan and analyse the possibility and impact of establishing an environmental governance agreement with the objective of obligatory emission reduction goals. \r\n\r\nTo set incentives for environmental co-operation in the social dilemma situation, some possibilities have been discussed in the theoretical literature such as trade sanctions, which deter free-riding behaviour. Particular challenges to this region are the wide gap in the degree of economic development and the relative weakness of inter-governmental bodies. No institutions with sanction function exist. Therefore we put emphasis of this paper on the concept of equity, which has emerged in the context of inducing co-operation. Burden sharing depending on the individual capability enhances the acceptance of the agreement and hence promotes environmental co-operation. Thus, this concept is expected to play a key role in establishing the transnational cooperation framework and setting allocation of payments among industrialized and developing nations. In order to receive active support from the nations, the environmental governance has to be designed corresponding to their equity criteria. The purpose of this paper is to find out a feasible environmental regime by specifying appropriate equity criteria in the region of East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1368,0,'Climate change impacts on biodiversity','Levinsky','Irina','ilevinsky@bi.ku.dk','','','University of Copenhagen','Past and future impacts of climate change on African vertebrates\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1369,0,'IMPEC','Leboucher','Viviane','viviane.leboucher@edf.fr','','','EDF R&D / France','The aim of the study is to evaluate changes of surface temperature indicators (mean temperature, degree day etc.) using several models over Europe for the middle and the end of the 21th century.\r\n','2007-07-25','',1,''),(1370,0,'Regional climate scenarios for Spain','Esteban-Parra','Maria Jesus','esteban@ugr.es','','','Universidad de Granada','We wish to compare and validate different GCMs for its use in the generation of local climate change scenarios for the Iberian Peninsula.

We propose to examine the 3-hourly CMIP3 GCM output for thermal tides. If we find a tidal signal in the CMIP3 output, we will consider studying high-frequency GCM output archived by AMIP as well. The AMIP data includes 6-hourly wind velocity at 850 and 200 hPa levels as required fields, and at 50 hPa as an optional field. To the best of our knowledge, no other CMIP or AMIP projects have studied atmospheric tides.\r\n\r\nEarly observations revealed that the semi-diurnal component is a prominent part of the surface response even though it is generated primarily in the middle atmosphere. In addition to the presence of tides, the phase of the semidiurnal tide is a particularly interesting indicator. Climate-oriented GCMs traditionally concentrate on the lower atmosphere, with the stratosphere and higher levels poorly resolved, but many of the CMIP3 models extend up to or above the 1 hPa level and some may have adequate (~5 km) resolution in the stratosphere. We will see if these model characteristics correlate with the ability to simulate atmospheric tides.\r\n\r\nIf some GCM output does appear to give reasonable simulation of the tides, then we may want to entrain Aiguo Dai from NCAR into this project.

As a result of the correction, per time-step RMSE in latent heat, sensible heat and NEE is reduced by as much as 45%, translating to reductions of as much as 90% on annual time scales when tested against a range of Fluxnet sites. Three LSMs are considered. By manipulating the relationship between neural network training and testing sets, we show that LSM bias is relatively independent of vegetation characteristics, and further that the nature of bias is shared between some LSMs. This type of result has the potential to reveal which areas of model parameterisation are weak as well as to provide a metric for model independence.

Blanford envisioned that the tropical Indian Ocean not only supplies the moisture for the Asian summer monsoon rains but that it is also vitally `linked to the intensity of the monsoon through coupled land-atmosphere-ocean phenomena. Despite sustained improvements in climate models, simulating the monsoon annual cycle and its variations at intraseasonal to interannual time scales remains one of the most difficult challenges for the modeling community. There are a number of reasons for the models\\\' poor performance. First, and perhaps foremost, is the complexity of the monsoon, which involves the interaction of phenomena on a variety of time(intraseasonal to interannual and longer) and space(regional to global) scales.  Secondly, key physical processes (e.g., the generation of clouds) are not adequately represented in the models. Thirdly, we lack the necessary observations that are needed to provide a more complete understanding of air-sea-land interaction processes that shape the mean monsoon and its variability. \r\n\r\nIn this study, the ability of the current state-of-the-art coupled models to simulate the summer season (June-September) climatology of key variables, such as precipitation, soil moisture, the vertical distribution of moisture, vertical velocity, sea surface temperature, and salinity will be presented. In particular, our diagnostics will focus on: (i) the sensitivity to the models\\\' basic state in representing the spectrum of monsoon variability, including synoptic systems to the ENSO-monsoon association; and (ii) the role of air-sea interactions over the tropical Indian Ocean in ameliorating systematic errors in the simulation of the mean monsoon and its variability. In addition, results from sensitivity experiments with linear atmospheric models, and diagnostics from newly available satellite observations will be discussed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 12:22:30'),(4,'CANCELED_Bagley','Justin','Eric DeWeaver','Dynamical Implications of the Cold Polar Tropopause Bias for Midlatitude Jets: Results from Simple Models, the IPCC Archive and Data Assimilation Experiments','Bagley_J_1','L','','Dynamical Implications of the Cold Polar Tropopause Bias for Midlatitude Jets: Results from Simple Models, the IPCC Archive and Data Assimilation Experiments\r\n\r\nJustin Bagley and Eric DeWeaver\r\n\r\nThe extratropical surface westerlies are a critical component of the climate system, given their influence on local climate, air-sea gas exchange, ocean circulation, and so on.  Accurate simulation of the strength, location, and seasonality of the surface westerlies is typically achieved through ad hoc \\\"tuning\\\" of surface and gravity wave drag, tuning which sometimes yields imperfect results.  In the current NCAR model the Northern Hemisphere surface westerlies are too strong by a factor of two.  Also, the tuning is resolution dependent, as surface westerlies usually shift poleward with increased resolution. Beyond these specific problems, the tuning of the westerlies may obscure fundamental relationships between the strength and location of the westerlies, heat and momentum fluxes due to stormtracks and stationary waves, and other dynamical factors.  These relationships may be critical for understanding the response of surface winds to changes in climate forcing.\r\n\r\nUsing model simulations from the IPCC archive, Lorenz and DeWeaver demonstrated a close association between the radiatively forced rise in tropopause height due to global warming and the concurrent poleward shift of the surface westerlies.  This association was reproduced in a simple \\\"dry GCM\\\" in which tropopause height could be externally controlled. The association is of interest for the simulation of surface westerlies because most climate models have a cold bias at the polar tropopause, which is equivalent to a high bias in tropopause height. Thus, we speculate that correcting the cold polar tropopause bias should result in a (possibly undesirable) southward shift of the surface westerlies.\r\n\r\nSince its introduction in atmospheric science, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has typically been employed as a state estimation tool for data assimilation.  Here we use the EnKF of the NCAR Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) to selectively correct the cold polar tropopause bias in the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model(CAM), for the purpose of identifying, quantifying, and analyzing the impacts of the bias.\r\n\r\nWe first identify the cold polar tropopause bias through inspection of the zonal mean temperature shift that occurs at each assimilation step.  By selectively assimilating only observations poleward of 66N, and between 300 and 150mb, this bias is eliminated.  Through evaluation of statistical relationships found in the ensemble, we find that the direct impact of assimilating polar tropopause observations to be localized near the region of the observations.  However, the resulting zonal mean circulation throughout the northern hemisphere has also been influenced by the assimilation through secondary effects.  The consequences of this influence include equatorward shifts in the extratropical surface westerlies and midlatitude jet, as well as reduced model bias in the zonal mean wind field throughout the hemisphere.  These results are broadly consistent with the association between jet location and tropopause height found in the IPCC simulations.\r\n','2007-02-02 17:40:15'),(5,'Balmaseda','Magdalena','A.

Two different periods were studied: one associated with present climate between 1978 and 2000, and the other associated with future climate, between 2001 and 2100. The relatively short period  used to represent the present climate was selected because the reanalyses are more representative of real data over the oceanic areas only after 1978 when satellite data began to be fully used. The evaluation of the simulations of present climate was done using Climate of the 20th Century (20C3M) experiments; the scenarios A1B, A2 and B1 were used for the period 2001-2100. \r\n\r\nThe identification of the dominant SLP patterns over the selected region was performed through a T-mode Varimax Rotated Principal Components Analysis (PCA) using the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and the outputs from some selected models using the correlation matrix as input.

SLP fields, linear spatial correlation coefficients between monthly mean SLP fields derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and from GCMs were calculated. Likewise, for the same purpose, linear correlation coefficients between the PCs derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and from the GCMs outputs were also calculated. \r\n\r\nThe T-mode PCA of the monthly mean SLP obtained from NCEP/NCAR reanalyses shows that there are three predominant patterns that characterize SLP fields over the extense region of the Southern Hemisphere analyzed. PC1 represents the summer surface circulation with the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs in their southernmost positions. PC2 and PC3 represent the winter circulation with the South Atlantic and South Pacific in the northernmost position (PC2) and a surface pattern that characterizes the frontal activity during that season (PC3). Time series of the three PCs show a positive linear trend of the summer mode and slightly negative trends for the winter indicating that the summer mode increased at the expense of the winter ones.  \r\n\r\nMonthly correlation coefficients between the output from the GCMs and the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses show that all of the models represent adequately the SLP fields during most of the year with the lower correlations during the austral autumn (March-April-May). The GCMs with better representation of the monthly mean SLP fields are UKMO_HadGEM1, UKMO_HadCM3, ECHAM5/MPI-OM, IPSL-CM4 and CNRM-CM3, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.75 for all months. Application of PCA to the GCMs outputs of four of these models show that most of them represent the same spatial and temporal varability identified with NCEP/NCAR reanalyses. These GCMs show the same three dominant patterns and also represent adequately the linear trends, showing an increase of the summer mode at expense of the winter ones, especially in UKMO_HadGEM1, ECHAM5/MPI-OM and CNRM-CM3. This result indicates that these set of GCMs are able to represent not only mean fields but also the interannual variability of SLP over the analyzed region.\r\n\r\nThe PCA performed to the GCMs output corresponding to the future period shows approximately the same predominant patterns of SLP obtained for the 20C3M experiments. The time series associated indicate that the increase of the summer mode at the expense of the winter one will continue. These trends are more pronounced in the A2 scenario showing that the changes are related to differences between atmospheric concentrations gases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 12:23:54'),(7,'Betts','Alan','','The Land-Surface-Cloud Interaction','Betts_A_1','S','','The Land-Surface-Cloud Interaction\r\n\r\nAlan K. Betts\r\n\r\nOn timescales of a day and space scales of order 800km, the climate over land is a complex balance of many highly coupled processes. In the atmosphere, water vapor convergence is linked to precipitation and clouds, which in turn modify the radiation field. The surface energy budget is strongly influenced by the cloud field, and the availability of water for evaporation. Cloud feedbacks in models have long been regarded as a major source of uncertainty in climate modeling. We propose that the effective cloud albedo at the surface is a missing and observable link, which connects the cloud fields to both surface and large-scale processes. We have developed a methodology using daily averaged data for understanding the coupling between physical processes in models, so that different models can be compared with each other and with data.  We illustrate this first using model data from ERA 40 for the Madeira River, a south-western basin of the Amazon, which has a large seasonal cycle with a dry season in the austral winter. Daily-mean land-surface fluxes and state variables can be used to map the transitions of the surface â¿¾climate\\\' of a model; and to quantify the links between the soil moisture, the mean cloud-base and cloud field, the short-wave and long-wave radiation fields at the surface, the vertical motion field, the atmospheric precipitable water and the surface precipitation. We then use long time-series of daily mean data from the three BERMS flux sites in central Saskatchewan to explore biases in ERA-40 on the grid-point scale, and to study the relationships between surface variables and fluxes and cloud cover in the observed and model data sets. On the seasonal timescale the biases in ERA-40 of temperature and humidity are small, but the model has a high bias of evaporative fraction in the warm season, and except in mid summer a low bias of reflective cloud, which peaks in mid winter. Reanalysis data for sub-basins of the Mississippi are then used to explore the links between these processes on river basin scales, using for evaluation observed surface precipitation and surface shortwave fluxes derived by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. The satellite data show that ERA-40 has the same seasonal bias in cloud albedo [reaching -10% in winter) over the Mississippi as was seen in central Saskatchewan from comparisons with the BERMS flux-tower measurements. Other critical model relationships are explored. Moisture convergence leads to clouds and precipitation, but the relation of the diabatic precipitation heating and the surface cloud radiative forcing, while a function of cloud albedo, is largely independent of moisture convergence, although it does depend on cloud base. The surface cloud radiative forcing determines the surface net radiation, while evaporative fraction is primarily determined in the model by temperature and soil water. Near-surface relative humidity, the lifting condensation level, soil moisture and precipitation are also closely linked.\r\n','2007-02-07 12:24:50'),(8,'Biasutti','Michela','','Developing a Performance Metric for the Simulation of Rainfall Variability and Change: The Case of the Sahel','Biasutti_M_1','L','','Developing a Performance Metric for the Simulation of Rainfall Variability and Change: The Case of the Sahel \r\n\r\nMichela Biasutti (LDEO) \r\n\r\nCan a good performance in the simulation of the 20th century lend credence to the prediction for the 21st century?

Whether the CO2 sensitivity of these models is correct is the subject of important debate. Does a realistic amount of warming occur in the models when CO2 is increased? \r\n\r\nPaleoclimate model-data comparisons represent the best test of model CO2 sensitivity. In one approach, past surface temperatures and pCO2 are estimated from well-preserved geochemical proxies. The inferred CO2 concentration is specified to the model, along with other boundary conditions appropriate for the study interval, and the model is run to equilibrium. If the model CO2 sensitivity is adequate and all other important climate forcings have been properly incorporated in the model, then model-predicted temperatures should match the temperatures inferred from data to within the uncertainty in the paleotemperature proxy technique.\r\n\r\nWe have compared the AR4 models? predictions of warming to the warming (relative to the modern) inferred for geologic intervals when atmospheric CO2 concentrations are believed to have been about 4 times the modern concentration. Arctic Ocean, tropical north Atlantic and Southern Atlantic upper ocean temperature estimates are available from well-preserved foraminifera and organic carbon compounds preserved in early Eocene (~55 Ma) and late Cretaceous (~90 Ma) marine sediments. The geochemistry of organic carbon in sediments of these ages suggest CO2 concentrations of 1500-2500 ppm. The range of surface warming achieved with quadrupled CO2 in seven of the IPCC AR4 models is 7-18ï¿½C in the Arctic Ocean, 3-5ï¿½C in the tropics, and 2-8ï¿½C in the far South Atlantic. However, the past warm climate data suggest mean annual surface temperatures at least 28ï¿½C higher than modern in the Arctic, 6-12ï¿½C higher in the tropical Atlantic, and 14-24ï¿½C higher at 65ï¿½S latitude in the Atlantic. In order to adequately match the temperatures inferred from geochemical data for the Eocene and Cretaceous, the models require CO2 concentrations in excess of 4000 ppm and an imposed increase in poleward heat transport (to reduce the equator-pole temperature gradient). A match can also be achieved with the models if the atmospheric methane concentration is increased by at least an order of magnitude and CO2 concentrations of >2500 ppm are specified. If the data-based estimates of past temperatures and CO2 concentrations are correct, the models being used to predict future warming largely underestimate the temperatures that will result with a quadrupling of CO2, and the underestimate is greatest in high latitude regions. \r\n     \r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 12:25:40'),(10,'Brekke','Levi','Michael Anderson, Michael Dettinger, Edwin Maurer','A Distance-based Methodology for Comparing Longer-Term, Multi-Metric Model Performance','Brekke_L_1','L','','Brekke*1, Levi D., Michael Anderson2, Michael Dettinger3, Edwin Maurer4\r\n\r\n1U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Technical Service Center, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO, 80225\r\n2CA Dept. of Water Resources, Div. of Flood Management, Sacramento, CA\r\n3USGS and Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA\r\n4Santa Clara University, Civil Engineering Department, Santa Clara, CA\r\n\r\nemail: lbrekke@do.usbr.gov\r\n\r\nA Distance-based Methodology for Comparing Longer-Term, Multi-Metric Model Performance\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing regional risk assessment, climate projection distribution functions are being developed for Northern California, representing an ensemble of IPCC AR4 projections produced by 17 coupled models simulating either SRES A2 or B1.  It is questioned whether these distribution functions should built to reflect unequal model-weighting derived from relative model performance in the 20th Century Climate Experiment (20C3M).  \r\n\r\nTo explore this question, 59 20C3M simulations from the same 17 models were evaluated statistically during 1950 1999.  These statistics were then compared to reference conditions during the same period (NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, Kaplan Extended SST v2).  This comparison was made for a range of statistical metrics applied to different global variables, local variables, and teleconnections relevant to Northern California climate (i.e. local precipitation and surface air-temperature, North Pacific sea level pressure index, and Nino3 sea surface temperature index).  Metric-specific differences were then aggregated using a distance scheme to reveal multi-metric model-to-reference similarity. Relative model weights were derived from similarity calculations and ultimately used in producing weighted estimates of climate projection distribution functions.  \r\n\r\nPresentation will provide an overview of methods, but focus mainly on results from 20c3m similarity analyses.  Results show that although bias for a given metric can vary significantly among the models analyzed, the relative degrees of bias varies considerably depending on the variable and/or metric.

Accordingly a modified scheme (featuring reduced mixing in stable conditions over the sea and the inclusion of non-local momentum mixing in convective conditions) has been introduced to both the NWP and climate versions of the Met Office Unified Model.\r\n\r\nThe top-down approach required short-range NWP errors to be conditionally sampled in a physically relevant way. Over land, it was found that both the Met Office and ECMWF models show systematic biases, with near surface winds which are too weak by day (especially in summer), and too strong by night. Over sea, wind direction was used as a proxy for stability, and strikingly different biases in wind speed and direction (relative to QuikSCAT and conventional observations) were found in northerly and southerly wind conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom-up approach, single column model simulations were compared with idealized large-eddy simulations and observations.

Here, we propose an energetics metric to compare and contrast a variety of ocean-only and coupled models.

Firstly we test the robustness of this equation by using a variety of ocean-only models and data-assimilation products, in order to establish a baseline for this relationship. We show that for interannual variability the models are similar however seasonally they behave quite differently, some having a pronounced semi-annual signal. With the baseline established, we apply our method to the IPCC coupled model simulations. We find that the net dissipation rates and the mechanisms for dissipation vary greatly from one model to the next, for a number of different physical reasons. One of the striking differences between coupled models is in the way they partition energy between the seasonal cycle and interannual variability, which is investigated within the same framework. Further, we explore the differences in the ocean energetics that occur due to the emergence of a double ITCZ in some models, and also investigate the relationship between the effective coupling strength of a given model and its dissipative characteristics. Ultimately, we propose this energy-based analysis as an effective diagnostic tool for assessing and improving model performance. \r\n','2007-02-07 10:17:39'),(13,'CANELLED Brunet','Gilbert','Y.

Atmos. Sci.) it was demonstrated that in an idealized simulation of an intensifying hurricane that vortex Rossby waves (VRWs) explain a significant amount of the wave activity. The diagnostics based on Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux, and its divergence, show that the VRWs are concentrated in the inner-core region where the radial gradient of the basic state potential vorticity is large. In general, these waves propagate outward in the lower troposphere and inward in the upper troposphere. The VRWs lead to significant wave-mean-flow interaction, as indicated by the divergence of the EP flux, with tangential wind acceleration of order 1-2 m/s per hour in the vicinity of the eyewall region. The VRWs show also characteristics typical of flow with critical layer and sheared disturbances. In case of monotonic angular wind distribution, the VRW critical level position depends on the VRW characteristics: intense (weak)hurricanes have their VRW critical layer close (far away) to their inner-core due to their fast (slow) phase speed. Hence these mesovortices are responsible for the dynamical processes controlling the redistribution of angular momentum from the inner core to the far field. It then seems that strong hurricanes are relatively more efficient in retaining their angular momentum than weak hurricanes that tend to radiate away their angular momentum.\r\n\r\nThese wave processes have been studied using wave activity diagnostics, like in Chen et al. (2003, JAS), in a series of high resolution tropical simulations of hurricanes Earl (September 1998) and Isabel (September 2003), using the Environment Canada MC2 non-hydrostatic LAM and the high resolution PSU-NCAR nonhydrostatic mesoscale model MM5 respectively, which resolves the convective scale and the critical layer. These simulations and others with lower resolution will be used to comment the role of these vortex Rossby waves in the angular momentum transport in hurricanes. We will point out also the expected implication of these results in the context of systematic errors in numerical weather prediction and climate models at different space-time resolutions for intensifying and mature hurricanes of different strengths.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\nChen, Y., G.

Monthly fields derived from different models were compared with the University of Delaware database available in a 0.5? x 0.5? grid for the period 1950-99. Those models with good representation of the dominant regional patterns in the area delimited by 15?S-60?S and 80?W-45?W were selected to analyze future seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation scenarios. The evaluation of present climate model simulations was done using Climate of the 20th Century (20C3M) experiments and scenarios A1B and A2 were used to prepare climate change scenarios for the period 2020-2029.\r\n\r\nGCMs skill to represent the observed temperature and precipitation fields was assessed from the linear spatial correlation coefficients between monthly mean fields derived from the observed database and from GCMs. Differences between observed and GCM anuual mean fields were also calculated to identify regions with large biases. \r\n\r\nSurface temperature linear monthly correlation coefficients are higher than 0.7 for all the analyzed GCMs with the lowest values during the summer months. Spatial representation of the annual mean temperature show that all GCMs overestimate its magnitude in about 5?C in the central region of the Andes and underestimate it in 3?C in the Patagonia. In the Plata Basin differences among GCMs are evident with some of them (i.e. MPI_ECHAM5, GFDL_CM2_1, CNRM_CM3_1 y CSIRO_Mk3_0) overestimating the annual mean temperature. \r\n\r\nPrecipitation analysis shows that the lowest linear spatial correlation coefficients are observed during the austral autmn and spring months. All GCMs show some similar patterns: underestimation of annual rainfall over the Plata Basin and central Chile and overestimation over the central-western of Argentina, northern Chile, Bolivia and to the south of 40?S.\r\n\r\nSeasonal and annual surface temperature and precipitation scenarios for 2020-2029 based on 1961-90 were prepared composing those GCMs with better agreement with the present climate. The statistical significance at a 5% level was calculated showing a significant regional warming in the annual mean temperature between 0.7?C and 1.4?C. Annual precipitation scenarios show areas like the Humid Pampas and the southern region of La Plata basin with increasing rainfall between 1% and 8% and significant decreasing values in all the mountain region of Los Andes and Patagonia. Only a region of the Humid Pampas, its size depending on the SRES scenario, shows a significant positive rainfall change.\r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 12:26:43'),(15,'Chang','Ching-Yee','','A Comparison of the Stratus Clouds in the NCEP CFS03 and NCAR CCSM3','Chang_CY_1','S','','A Comparison of the Stratus Clouds in the NCEP CFS03 and NCAR CCSM3\r\n\r\nChing-Yee Chang\r\n\r\nUMD\r\n\r\nThe stratus clouds over the Southeast oceans can reduce the incoming solar radiation and cool the sea water.

This study indicates that the deficiency of the stratus clouds may be related to the failure in simulating the subtropical temperature inversion.

E. Gill?s ?shallow water? approach) has proven to be a useful technique for elucidating the essential features of the large-scale tropical circulation. More recently, this method has been expanded and applied to more sophisticated primitive equation models (e.g. Wu et al. 2000, Amer. Meteor. Soc.), showing that the response of the atmosphere depends highly on the vertical distribution of diabatic heating.\r\n\r\nGiven that low-level tropical circulation errors exist in the current Hadley Centre AGCM (HadGAM1), it is of relevance to establish the sensitivity of the model dynamics to the tropical heating profile, and also to diagnose how well the model parametrization schemes represent the vertical structure of the heating. To achieve these aims, the technique of studying heat-induced tropical circulations is applied to the dry dynamical core of HadGAM1. This idealised model atmosphere is initialised with a motionless basic state in hydrostatic balance, with no horizontal temperature gradients. A circulation is then driven exclusively by a localised tropical heat source which is centred along the equator at some arbitrary longitude. Results are shown which suggest that HadGAM1 dynamics respond to changes in the vertical structure of heating in a way that is consistent with theory; however, analysis of the diabatic heating profile taken from a HadGAM1 aqua-planet simulation show that the model physics produces a more bottom-heavy heating profile than is expected. The excessive low level heating may be due to a lack of representation of older, decaying convective activity which typically produces stratiform precipitation. This missing physical process also has wider implications for coupled atmosphere-ocean configurations, where the excessive heating produces overly-strong easterly wind stresses which contribute to cold SST biases along the equatorial Pacific and the poor simulation of ENSO.\r\n','2007-01-25 10:36:56'),(22,'Demory','Marie-Estelle','Pier Luigi Vidale and Malcolm Roberts','The Role of Land Surface Processes in the Indian Summer Monsoon: A High-Resolution GCM Study','Demory_ME_1','I','','The Role of Land Surface Processes in the Indian Summer Monsoon: A High-Resolution GCM Study\r\n  \r\nMarie-Estelle Demory*, Pier Luigi Vidale* and Malcolm Roberts**\r\n  * NCAS-Climate, University of Reading, UK\r\n  ** Met Office Hadley Centre, Exeter, UK\r\n   \r\nThe Indian summer monsoon is a vital climate process, affecting the lives of many millions of people. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is important for prediction.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we investigate the impact of land surface processes on the Indian monsoon. In fact, previous studies(e.g. Becker et al. 2001) have investigated the importance of snow cover in Eurasia for the onset of the monsoon, which may be linked by a modification of the positioning of the subtropical jet and thus circulation. Moreover, other studies (e.g. Ferranti et al. 1999) indicated the existence of a positive feedback between soil moisture and precipitation, which may have an impact on the maintenance of the summer Indian monsoon.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of investigating these two mechanisms, we use the high-resolution (60km) atmospheric version of the Hadley Centre\\\'s general circulation model HadGEM1 (NUGAM, developed as part of the UK-Japan Climate Collaboration). We show that lower resolution versions of HadGEM1 have poor skill at representing the monsoon; NUGAM performs better, probably due to the fact that mesoscale mountains are resolved, affecting both Himalaya snow cover and local circulation. However the soil remains too dry in India during the summer and precipitation too little. As further sensitivity tests for this study, soil physical parameters as well as the treatment of snow-melt infiltration have been modified.\r\n\r\nResults from the first experiment indeed show an improvement in the development of the Indian monsoon, which still needs further investigation. The land surface climate of other regions of the world is also better represented, with the reduction of a significant warm bias over land, present in HadGEM1 at all resolutions.\r\n','2007-02-07 10:20:43'),(23,'Deque','Michel','','Tendency Errors in a Climate Model: Iterative Estimation','Deque_M_1','S','','Tendency Errors in a Climate Model: Iterative Estimation\r\n\r\nMichel Deque\r\n\r\nMeteo-France CNRM/GMGEC/EAC     Tel.  : (33) 561 07 93 82\r\n42 Avenue Coriolis              Fax   : (33) 561 07 96 10\r\nFRANCE 31057 Toulouse Cedex 01  Email : deque@meteo.fr\r\n\r\nIn climate modeling, contrary to short-range forecasting, systematic errors are measured as the difference between the equilibrium reached (after a couple of months of integration in the case of the atmosphere, after a few decades for an ocean model although a slow drift can maintain for centuries) and a long term average of observations or reanalyses. In this approach, the systematic error is a residual of possibly compensating physical errors (e.g. cooling by too much low clouds and warming by erroneous advection). Moreover, the models are calibrated in order to minimize this kind of systematic error. Validating a model this way can be compared to validating a statistical prediction on the learning sample. At the end of the 1990?s, the POTENTIALS European project proposed to analyze another type of modeling error, the tendency error. This error is measured by the initial departure between the model and an observed condition. This is closer to the approach in NWP. There can still be error compensation between the physical parameterizations (1D models as in the EUROCS European project are in this case the most appropriate approach), but the dynamics (i.e. the advection) is by construction error-free. The difficulty of the approach is that the numerical model does not start from an equilibrium state and one should avoid confusing tendency errors due to the physics and strong adjustments due to the numerics. The POTENTIALS approach proposed to nudge the velocity field with a tight constraint and the mass field with a looser constraint. With a strong relaxation, the model still generates numerical noise which pollutes the signal to be analyzed. With a weak relaxation, the model state may be far from the observed trajectory, and the tendency error includes additional errors or compensations.\r\n\r\nThe approach proposed here consists of considering an iterative approach in which the model is progressively corrected from its tendency error. The iterative process converges after a few iterations and seven 44-year (the ERA40 period) model runs are necessary to get a stable estimate with the ARPEGE AGCM. Although numerically expensive, this technique offers a new way of analyzing climate models. The cost of the method prevents from any ad hoc adjustment in the model, and a proof of its efficiency is obtained by the better behavior (mean climatology bias and seasonal forecast skill) of a model in which this error is subtracted directly from the equations. Results with ARPEGE in TL63-L31 will be shown.\r\n','2007-02-07 12:31:17'),(24,'Didone','Marco','Huw C.

Davies, IACETH Zurich, 2006\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach is set out for a systematic study of the difference between the forecast and contemporaneous analysis analysis field of a particular predictions system(the ECMWF). The underlying rationale is two-fold. First this perspective\\\'s intrinsic properties imply that :- (a) nonconservation of error PV signifies either isentropic advection of the error across an ambient flow\\\'s PVgradient, the misrepresentation of diabatic or frictional processes, and /or error in the analysis field at the verification time; and (b) inversion of a particular feature of the error PV-field can (via attribution) account for error of the primary flow variables in both the in-situ and far-field. Second the dynamics of rapid error growth has been linked to distinctive PV-features of the error field.\r\n\r\nIllustrations and interpretations are proffered of this difference when viewed in terms of PV for single autumn, winter and spring (2001/02) climatology. The evolution of this pseudo-error is investigated in term of forecast length with the pseudo-errors of forecasts of different lengths. Two model versions (T511 and T711) are compared. The results point out various discrepancies e.g. in the location of the jet between analysis and forecast which increases in amplitude for longer forecast length.

Our analysis shows that the emissions pathway chosen has a greater impact on future simulated climate than the criteria used to obtain the ensemble means. Annual-mean T is projected to increase by about 2-4?C over the period 1990-2100 in the Alpine region, with roughly 5 ?C in summer. Annual-mean P is projected to decrease during the 21st century, though with a likely wintertime increase.

This approach has been used since the early-mid 90s by the French, U.S., Canadian, Australian and other climate modeling groups along with, or as an alternative to, the current widely-used nested-grid approach. Stretched-grid GCMs are used for continuous/autonomous climate simulations as usual GCMs, with the only difference that variable-resolution grids are used instead of more traditional uniform grids. The important advantages of variable-resolution SG-GCMs are that they do not require any lateral boundary conditions/forcing and are free of the associated undesirable computational problems. As a result, SG-GCMs provide self-consistent interactions between global and regional scales of motion and their associated phenomena, while a high quality of global circulation is preserved, as in uniform grid GCMs. Climate simulation results obtained with the SG-GCMs have shown the maturity of the SG approach.\r\n\r\nThe international SGMIP-1 (Stretched-Grid Model Intercomparison Project, phase-1), using variable-resolution SG-GCMs developed at major centers/groups in Australia, Canada, France, and the U.S., has been conducted in 2002-2005. The next phase-2 of the project, SGMIP-2, has been conducted in 2005-2007. The results of the 12-year (1987-1998) climate simulations of SGMIP-1 and the 25-year (1979-2003) climate simulations of SGMIP-2 for a major part of North America as well as for the entire global domain, are available at the SGMIP web site: http://essic.umd.edu/~foxrab/sgmip.html, and are described by the authors in Fox-Rabinovitz et al. (2006). The SGMIP-2 high resolution multi-model ensemble simulations provided the possibility for a comprehensive analysis of systematic errors for regional and global products obtained with enhanced variable and uniform resolution.\r\n\r\nThe multi-model SGMIP regional climate simulations were conducted with enhanced 0.45 degree - 0.5 degree regional resolution for SG-GCMs, with the same or a similar number of global grid points as in a 1 degree x 1 degree global grid. The multi-model ensemble SGMIP global simulations are conducted with: (a) intermediate 1 degree x 1 degree resolution (with the same or a similar number of global grid points as in SGs), and (b) fine 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree resolution. The SGMIP SG-GCM simulations are analyzed in terms of studying the impact of high regional resolution on efficient downscaling to realistic mesoscales and regional climate variability. We focused mostly on studying the systematic errors for the multi-model ensemble results. The differences between the models have been also determined. The SGMIP multi-model ensemble results for the region compare well with reanalysis and observations, in terms of spatial and temporal diagnostics. \r\n\r\nThe major SGMIP results in terms of systematic errors are as follows:  \r\n\r\n1. Regional biases for time-averaged model products are mostly limited to about half (or less) of typical reanalysis or observational errors. Biases are larger, up to twice the reanalysis or observational errors (but only for the southern polar domain); note that our SGs have the North American area of interest. Overall, biases are within the uncertainties of the available reanalyses. \r\n\r\n2. Both seasonal and interannual climate variability are well represented. Namely, annual cycles, seasonal differences, time series, and variances are close to those of observations or reanalyses. \r\n\r\n3. Orographically induced precipitation and other products are well simulated at meso- and larger scales due to high-resolution regional forcing. The major positive regional impact from stretching is obtained from better resolved model dynamics and regionally-enhanced resolution of stationary lower-boundary forcing, i.e. orography and land-sea effects. In that sense, the improvements are obtained near small-scale terrain features and coastlines, and are reflected, for example, in the Appalachian and coastal precipitation. \r\n\r\nOther SG-GCM results include the studies of systematic errors for: single model ensemble integrations (Fox-Rabinovitz et al. 2005), and the North American monsoon system (NAMS) for the multi-year time scales (Berbery and Fox-Rabinovitz 2003).\r\n\r\nThe future plans include: 1) conducting the phase-3 of the project, SGMIP-3, dedicated to simulation of future climate for the North American and other regions; and 2) contributing to the combined ensembles such as NARCCAP, including both nested and stretched grid models (using SGMIP-2 products for past climate and SGMIP-3 products for future climate). \r\n\r\nThe SGMIP results were presented to WMO/WGNE at its annual meetings in 2004, 2005, and 2006.

There have been significant changes to the model since then, including changing the atmosphere component to use a finite volume dynamical core.  More recently, changes have been made to the deep convection scheme, and to include momentum transport due to convection in the atmosphere component.  Recent parameterization changes in the ocean component include reducing the horizontal viscosity, changing how the eddy parameterization scheme transitions into the surface mixed layer, and making its eddy  coefficient a function of space and time.  In addition, a less diffusive advection scheme has been put into the ocean component.  The land component has a new, updated hydrology scheme and changes to the albedo formulation over land.  The most important biases in CCSM3 that have been significantly reduced by these changes are:  a) the double ITCZ in the tropical Pacific Ocean,  b) the period of the NINO3 sea surface temperature variations,  c) the precipitation biases over the Amazon and Congo regions, and d) the land surface temperature biases in the high Northern Hemisphere latitudes. \r\n','2007-02-02 17:44:22'),(28,'Grimm','Alice','A.

It has been shown that models? performance is seasonally dependent, but there has always been the assumption that, for a given season, it is constant. Here, we demonstrate that there are periods when those models perform well and periods when they do not capture observed climate variability. We compare the seasonal responses of two AGCMs to observed SST with seasonal observed fields during 1950-1994. The model performance is assessed through simultaneous correlation between reanalysis data and model output, averaged over 20? latitude × 40? longitude regions. Seasonal correlations coefficients (CCs) are computed for winter and summer in 11-year sliding periods. The EOF analysis of these sliding CCs discloses the interdecadal variations of the models? skill all over the globe. The relationships between these variations and interdecadal modes of SST variability are examined by correlating SST with the two first Principal Components. The statistical significance is assessed through Monte Carlo procedure. The correlation patterns resemble closely those associated with well-known low-frequency variability (PDO and NAO), indicating that the modes of models? performance vary coherently with these interdecadal variability modes. These results suggest that there are un-modelled climate processes that affect seasonal climate prediction as well as scenarios of climate change, particularly regional climate-change projections. Their reliability may depend on the time slice being analyzed. More comprehensive assessments should include a verification of the long-term stability of the models? performance.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments.

Here we map out a strategy for targeted observation of the climate system to reduce divergence in simulations of climate feedbacks, relying on the example of snow albedo feedback.  The strength of this feedback in current models exhibits nearly a factor-of-three spread, which in turn accounts for much of the spread in the models\\\' annual-mean temperature response in heavily-populated northern hemisphere land masses.    These large intermodel variations in feedback strength in climate change are nearly perfectly correlated with comparably large intermodel variations in feedback strength in the context of the seasonal cycle.  Moreover, the feedback strength in the real seasonal cycle can be measured and compared to simulated values.  \r\n\r\nThese mostly fall outside the range of the observed estimate, indicating many models have an unrealistic snow albedo feedback in the seasonal cycle context.  Because of the tight correlation between simulated feedback strength in the seasonal cycle and climate change, eliminating the model errors in the seasonal cycle will lead directly to a reduction in the spread of feedback strength in climate change.   We also discuss the possibility of observational strategies to reduce the spread in other feedbacks contributing to climate sensitivity.\r\n\r\n','2007-01-25 16:39:22'),(30,'Hannay','Cecile','Dave Williamson, Jeff Kiehl, Jim Hack, Jerry Olson, Chris Bretherton, Steve Klein and Martin Koehler','Forecasts of Southeast Pacific Stratocumulus with the NCAR, GFDL and ECMWF Models','Hannay_C_1','S','','Forecasts of Southeast Pacific Stratocumulus with the NCAR, GFDL and ECMWF Models\r\n\r\nCecile Hannay, Dave Williamson, Jeff Kiehl, Jim Hack, Jerry Olson, Chris Bretherton, Steve Klein and Martin Koehler.\r\n\r\nWe examine forecasts of Southeast Pacific Stratocumulus at 20S, 85W during the East Pacific Investigation of Climate(EPIC) cruise of October 2001 with the NCAR, NCAR-UW, GFDL and ECMWF models. The NCAR-UW is a modified version of the NCAR model that uses the turbulence and shallow convection schemes developed at the University of Washington. \r\n\r\nObservations during the EPIC cruise show a very stable and well-mixed boundary layer under a sharp inversion. The inversion height and the cloud layer have a strong and regular diurnal cycle. The forecasts are initialized from atmospheric conditions and each model is run for 5 days  to determine the drift from the field data. This method allows us to diagnose parameterization deficiencies. The atmospheric initial conditions are obtained from ECMWF analyses, which provide a good estimate of the EPIC column state, although the height of the PBL and the strength of the inversion are underestimated compared to the EPIC radiosonde data.\r\n\r\nA key problem common to the 4 models is that the forecasted PBL height is too low compared to observations. The ECMWF model shows a steady PBL with no significant decrease or increase of the inversion height. The LWP and its diurnal cycle are represented very well in the ECWMF forecasts. In particular, the daytime LWP is well captured while the other models unrealistically collapse the LWP during daytime. This affects the solar flux at the surface. The ECMWF forecasts also have some deficiencies: it produces a cloud layer too thick compared to observations. The NCAR forecasts show 2 typical behaviors: either the PBL is maintained or it collapses, while the observations during the same period do not show any shallowing of the PBL. Climate runs with the NCAR model also show an inability to maintain the proper PBL depth. When the PBL collapses, the model becomes very moist near the surface. The cloud fraction is poorly represented: the model produces an unrealistically thick layer of clouds that sometimes extends to the surface. The diurnal cycle is underestimated. The NCAR-UW forecasts show a similar maintenance or collapse of the PBL. When the PBL is maintained, the clouds are more realistic than in the NCAR model, occupying a single level. The model also better represents the diurnal cycle of the inversion height due to the entrainment of dry air at the top of the PBL. When the PBL collapses, the cloud fraction and cloud water in NCAR-UW go to zero. The GFDL forecasts have periods during which the boundary layer becomes shallower. The collapse is less dramatic than in the NCAR forecasts but it is more pronounced than in the ECMWF ones. We also present SCM simulations with the NCAR and NCAR-UW models to better understand the mechanisms that control the PBL.\r\n','2007-02-07 10:27:28'),(31,'Hansen','J.A.','Jean-Christophe Golaz and Vince E.

The source of these inadequacies is difficult to pinpoint because parameterizations contain nonlinearities and feedbacks.  To help elucidate such model inadequacies, this presentation demonstrates the use of a general purpose ensemble parameter estimation technique. In principle, the technique is applicable to any parameterization that contains a number of adjustable coefficients. It optimizes or calibrates parameter values by attempting to match predicted fields to reference datasets. Rather than striving to find the single best set of parameter values, the output is instead an ensemble of parameter sets. This ensemble provides a wealth of information. In particular, it can help uncover model deficiencies and structural errors that might not otherwise be easily revealed.  The calibration technique is applied to an existing single-column model (SCM) that parameterizes boundary-layer clouds. The SCM is a higher order turbulence closure model.  It is closed using a multi-variate probability density function (PDF) that represents subgridscale variability. Reference datasets are provided by large-eddy simulations (LES) of a variety of cloudy boundary layers.  The calibration technique locates some model errors in the SCM. As a result, empirical modifications are suggested. These modifications are evaluated with independent datasets and found to lead to an overall improvement in the SCM\\\'s performance.\r\n','2007-01-26 08:10:54'),(32,'Inness','Peter','Julia Slingo','The Interaction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and the Maritime Continent in a GCM','Inness_P_1','I','','The Interaction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and the Maritime Continent in a GCM\r\n\r\nPeter Inness and Julia Slingo\r\nNational Centre for Atmospheric Science - Climate Division, University of Reading\r\n\r\nAs the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) passes over the islands of the Maritime Continent it is observed to weaken somewhat before reinvigorating over the West Pacific.

In this study, the effect of the topography of the Maritime Continent islands acting to disrupt the low level wind and pressure signal associated with the MJO is investigated. An idealised modelling framework is used in which an eastward propagating SST anomaly dipole is used to force organised convection which resembles the MJO. It is found that, although the island topography in the GCM is very much lower than in reality, it has a disproportionately large impact on the low level winds and pressure trough to the east of the convective maximum of the MJO.

Results are presented for geopotential, temperature, relative humidity and horizontal wind components fields on standard surfaces over the Atlantic-European region during winter 2002. Various combinations of parameterization schemes for cumulus, PBL, moisture and radiation are used to identify which one provides a lesser difference between the model state and analysis. The comparison of the model fields is carried out versus ERA-40 reanalysis of the ECMWF. Results show that the rate, at which the model error grows as well as its magnitude, varies depending on the forecast range, atmospheric variable and level. The typical spatial scale and structure of the model error also depends on the particular atmospheric variable. The distribution of the model error over the domain can be separated in two parts: the steady and transient. The first part is associated with a few high mountain regions including Greenland, where model error is larger.

A large part of this uncertainty is likely related to specification of model parameters. We estimate a lower bound to this part of the uncertainty as may be inferred from an ensemble of model configurations made from a single model (the NCAR CAM3.1 atmospheric GCM).  The choice of ensemble members is constrained by a stochastic, Bayesian based, importance sampling strategy whose likelihood function includes a normalized, multivariate measure of model skill that quantifies the distance among seasonal climatologies of model predictions and fifteen observational/reanalysis data products. We consider the effects of six parameters important to clouds and convection. The top six performing parameter sets improved model skill by 7% with nearly identical skill scores, but for different reasons related to the wide range of selected parameter values.  These model configurations were chosen for estimating the effect of parametric uncertainties on the predicted global warming response to 2xCO2. Five of the six model configurations had a 2xCO2 near surface air temperature sensitivity of 3 or 3.1 degrees with the final member having a sensitivity of 3.4 as compared to the 2.4 degree sensitivity of the default model configuration. Although the range in sensitivities was quite narrow after parameter values have been systematically constrained by observations, the regional climate predictions exhibited significant uncertainties up to 25% of the climate change signal for predictions of surface air temperature and up to 160% of the signal for precipitation. This calculation demonstrates the potential of using observations to substantially reduce climate model prediction uncertainties with a more formal method of multivariate model tuning. It also provides an estimate of the upper bound for single-model prediction skill, particularly for regional climates. \r\n','2007-02-07 12:33:56'),(36,'Jung','Thomas','Tim Palmer and Frederic Vitart','Sensitivity of the Simulated Atmospheric Circulation to Horizontal Resolution: From Climate to NWP Resolution','Jung_T_1','I','','Sensitivity of the Simulated Atmospheric Circulation to Horizontal Resolution: From Climate to NWP Resolution\r\n\r\nThomas Jung, Tim Palmer and Frederic Vitart\r\nECMWF\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the ECMWF model is used to study the sensitivity of various simulated atmospheric phenomena to horizontal resolution.

Moreover, it turns out that increasing resolution results in a much better representation of both extratropical and tropical cyclone characteristics (e.g., frequency of occurrence of hurricanes of different intensity).

Both GCMs were integrated for 10 years after spin-up with the observed monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice distribution climatology. For annual mean rainfall diurnal cycle, diurnal rainfall amplitude in GCM-TL959, defined by peak to-trough rainfall difference, is larger than that in TRMM 3G68 data over both land and the ocean. The local time of maximum rainfall in GCM-TL959 is 1-2 hour earlier than that in TRMM 3G68 data over both land and the ocean. However, there are large differences in simulated peak time with the TRMM 3G68 data over some region such as the southern slope of the Himalayas and Congo basin, equatorial Africa.

While the monsoon exhibits substantial interannual variations, its intraseasonal variability is of greater magnitude and hence of critical importance for predictability.  This intraseasonal variability is concentrated in the 30-50 day band and comprises a northwards-propagating oscillation(NPISO) between active and break phases of enhanced and reduced precipitation over India, while the opposing phase dominates over the equatorial Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations using general circulation models(GCMs) have suggested that the NPISO is an intrinsically atmospheric mode, but that atmosphere-ocean coupling is required to achieve realistic intensity and propagation speed.  Specifically, coupled GCMs (CGCMs) outperform atmosphere-only GCMs (AGCMs) due to the CGCMs ability to represent the near-quadrature phase relationship between sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and atmospheric deep convection.  Without atmosphere-ocean feedbacks, AGCMs too quickly initiate convection over warm SST anomalies. These studies have forced their AGCM simulations with SSTs from either a previous CGCM simulation or the NCEP (Reynolds) satellite SST product, however, both of which substantially underestimate intraseasonal SST variability across the tropical Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we have forced the Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model (HadAM3) with a new, high-frequency, observed SST dataset from the UK Met Office.  These SSTs show significantly more variability in the intraseasonal band than the existing NCEP dataset.  Two thirty-member ensembles have been conducted at 1 degree spatial resolution: one forced by daily SSTs and the other forced by monthly mean SSTs. These ensembles are compared to determine whether high-frequency, realistic SSTs can improve AGCM simulations of the intraseasonal variability of the Indian monsoon.  Composite active and break events are constructed from each ensemble and compared to similar composites taken from reanalysis to examine the degree to which each ensemble properly represents the physical mechanisms underlying the NPISO.\r\n','2007-01-26 09:11:50'),(40,'Kunkel','Ken','Xin-Zhong Liang, and Jinhong Zhu','The North American Monsoon in the AR4 20C3M Simulations','Kunkel_K_1','I','','The North American Monsoon in the AR4 20C3M Simulations\r\n\r\nKenneth E.

Kvamsto\r\n\r\nThe current general circulation models, including several of those used by the IPCC, show considerable disagreement in simulating present day high latitude climate. This is of major concern and reduces the confidence in future model projections of high latitude climate. The wintertime Arctic climate is characterized by a very shallow stable planetary boundary layer (from a few tenths to a couple hundred meters deep). The boundary layer is capped by a strong inversion. The lowest temperatures are found near the surface while the maximum temperature is found at the top of the inversion, typically at 500-1500 meters. The boundary layer turbulent activity is inhibited by the very stable atmospheric conditions. The very low turbulent activity may cause very low surface temperatures to form. To investigate how turbulent vertical exchange processes in the Arctic boundary layer is represented by the climate models a simulation with high vertical resolution in the lower part of the atmosphere is performed. This reveals that the coarse vertical resolution commonly employed in the climate models are unable to reproduce important exchange processes in the Arctic boundary layer. In the case of our model this results in a warm bias over the Arctic Ocean. By increasing the vertical resolution we achieve a better representation of vertical turbulent exchange processes with the result of reproducing more realistic surface fluxes and surface air temperatures.\r\n','2007-02-07 10:34:13'),(43,'Launer','Zachary','Edward Vizy, and Kerry H.

The model simulation was run for 23 years (1979-2002), largely forced with high-frequency National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) atmospheric fluxes. Following a decade-long spin-up of the ice model, the fidelity of the ice extent, ice thickness, and ice drift distributions is examined. The model realistically simulates the space and time distributions of the global sea ice cover concentration, thickness and drift. The total ice area and extent agree well with Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) satellite data especially in the winter season in the Arctic and summer season in the Antarctic; overall the model quantities are larger by about 10% in the Arctic and 17-20% in the Antarctic suggesting that the model is reproducing well the observed seasonal cycles of ice extent and area. In the Weddell Sea, simulated ice thickness is compared with moored upward looking sonar data. At the locations of the open-ocean moorings, the agreement is good but it is less accurate near to the Weddell Peninsula. Statistics of ice drifting buoy observations agree well with temporally and spatially co-located simulated ice drifts both in terms of speed and direction.

We compute the Hayashi spectra of the 500hPa geopotential height fields and introduce an ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral sub-domains. The total wave variability is taken as a global scalar metric describing the overall performance of each model, while the total variability pertaining to the eastward propagating baroclinic waves and to the planetary waves are taken as scalar metrics describing the performance of each model phenomenologically in connection with the corresponding specific physical process. When considering the XX century simulations, only two very high-resolution global climate models have a good agreement with the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for both the global and the process-oriented metrics. Large biases, in several cases larger than 20%, are found in all the considered metrics between the wave climatologies of most IPCC models and the reanalyses, while the span of the climatologies of the various models is, in all cases, around 50%. In particular, the travelling baroclinic waves are typically overestimated by the climate models, while the planetary waves are usually underestimated, in agreement with what found is past analyses performed on global weather forecasting models. When comparing the results of similar models, it is apparent that in some cases the vertical resolution of the model atmosphere, the adopted ocean model, and the advection schemes seem to be critical in the bulk of the atmospheric variability. The models ensemble obtained by arithmetic averaging of the results of all models is biased with respect to the reanalyses but is comparable to the best 5 models. Nevertheless, the models results do not cluster around their ensemble mean. When considering the XXII century simulations, the first notable change is that in all cases the spectral densities tend to shift towards longer waves. Relatively small changes are observed in all GCMS for the global scalar metric. In virtually all GCMs eastward propagating baroclinic waves increase (up to about 20%), even if disagreement exist on the amount of the change, whereas for the long standing waves not all GCMs agree on the sign of the change. In general, GCMs with low variability in the 1961-2000 run tend to have less pronouned sensitivity with respect to climate forcing. This study suggests caveats with respect to the ability of most of the presently available climate models in representing the statistical properties of the global scale atmospheric dynamics of the present climate and, a fortiori, in the perspective of modeling climate change.\r\n','2007-01-26 09:36:27'),(47,'Lucarini','Valerio','Sandro Calmanti, Alessandro Dell\\\'Aquila, Paolo M.

The Northern Hemisphere climate features the planetary waves as a relevant ingredient of the atmospheric variability. Several observations and theoretical arguments seem to support the idea that winter planetary waves indicator obey a non-Gaussian statistics and may present a multimodal probability density function, thus characterizing the low-frequency portion of the climate system. We show that the upper tropospheric jet strength is a critical parameter in determining whether the planetary waves indicator exhibits a uni- or bimodal behavior, and we determine the relevant threshold value of the jet. These results are obtained by considering the data of the NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for the overlapping period. Our results agree with the non-linear orographic theory, which explains the statistical non-normality of the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere and its possible bimodality. Moreover, since the intensity of the jet is related to the ENSO phase, these results show a connection between the tropical and the mid-latitude climate. Data coming from the 1961-2000 simulations performed by two very high-resolution global climate models, which have been previously shown to represent very well the overall properties of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude winter atmospheric variability, match only partially this picture, thus providing some hints on models inaccuracy in representing large scale features.\r\n','2007-01-26 09:37:58'),(48,'Manganello','Julia','Bohua Huang','Investigating the Influence of Systematic Biases on the Annual Cycle and ENSO Variability in the Coupled GCMs Using Flux Correction Method','Manganello_J_1','L','','Investigating the Influence of Systematic Biases on the Annual Cycle and ENSO Variability in the Coupled GCMs Using Flux Correction Method\r\n\r\nJulia V. Manganello Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, Maryland  Bohua Huang Climate Dynamics Department, College of Science, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, Maryland   \r\n\r\nA series of coupled GCM experiments are conducted to test the hypothesis that the existence of systematic biases in the Tropics could have serious consequences for the quality of model-simulated variability on various temporal-spatial scales. To reduce annual mean errors in the coupled models, an empirical method is used in this study, such as the flux adjustment strategy, in which a prescribed correction term is added to the surface heat flux into the ocean.  This correction term varies spatially but is constant in time, and its magnitude is proportional to the annual mean local SST error in the directly coupled GCM integration. By design, it only affects the mean surface heat balance directly.  It must be noted that in this study we intentionally keep the flux correction at a minimum and target those errors with relatively clear physical error sources.  In the first part of our study the above heat flux correction method is applied in the Tropics, and is implemented in the coupled GCM, where the atmospheric component is the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) AGCM (Version 2) and the oceanic component is a quasi-isopycnal reduced-gravity OGCM. As expected, this constant heat flux correction eliminates most large mean SST errors in the directly coupled run, including the warm bias in the southeast Pacific and Atlantic. As a result, the corrected mean climate exhibits stronger SST asymmetry relative to the equator. It is found that, given better mean SST field, mean distributions of surface wind stress and precipitation are also improved in these regions.  Due to the improvement of the model mean state, the annual cycles of the SST and surface wind stress in the eastern equatorial Pacific become more realistic as a result of enhancement of their annual, rather than semi-annual, harmonics. The annual cycle of precipitation in the eastern Pacific is also improved due to more realistic seasonal SST variations in this region.  Both directly coupled and the flux corrected models simulate interannual variability in the tropical Pacific with some ENSO characteristics.  However, in the first version phase locking of ENSO to the annual cycle is unrealistic.  In the second, phase locking is well reproduced, likely due to more realistic seasonal evolution of the mean state.  The development of ENSO events at the equator and tropical teleconnections are also more realistic.  On the other hand, the simulated interannual variability is weaker and the timescale of ENSO cycle is longer in both runs compared to observations, but more so in the flux corrected simulation.  In the second part of our study we apply the heat flux correction method to the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS), which is a state-of-the-art fully coupled ocean-land-atmosphere dynamical seasonal prediction system for operational forecasts.  In the first experiment, heat flux correction is applied to the whole tropical oceans.  In the second, it is further localized to include only the southeast Pacific and Atlantic, where the SST bias is the largest.  Preliminary analysis shows that the mean SST errors in the southeast Pacific and Atlantic are significantly reduced in both experiments.  As a result of stronger SST gradient, equatorial easterlies are significantly enhanced and are closer to the observed, which is likely responsible for the deepened equatorial thermocline.  On the other hand, heat content and SST variability in the tropical Pacific is weaker in both runs compared to the directly coupled model simulation and the observations.  However, the ENSO cycle is less regular, and the duration of ENSO episodes is shortened and more in line with the observed variability.  Experiments with the uncoupled version of the Modular Ocean Model Version 3 (MOM3), which is the oceanic component of the CFS, are currently underway to test the hypothesis that the deepening of the equatorial thermocline in response to more realistic zonal wind stress has effectively weakened ENSO variability in the model.  In addition, we are currently introducing global wind stress correction into the CFS to test whether correcting wind stress, as opposed to SST, is a more efficient way to improve the simulation of the mean climate and ENSO variability.\r\n','2007-02-07 10:35:51'),(49,'Manzini','E.','M.A. Giorgetta, E.

These include the use of idealised models (single column model, aquaplanet,\r\ndynamical core), sensitivity tests designed to shed light on processes and investigate teleconnections, and \\\"spin-up\\\" tests which allow us to determine whether a systematic\r\nbias is the result of long-term feedbacks, e.g. through model drift, or an immediate movement of the model away from the initial observed state and from which it does not\r\nrecover.  In the latter case, it may be possible to attribute the source of the error to a particular parametrisation scheme, thus making its solution potentially rather easier.  Spin-up tests using climate models also provide a parallel with numerical weather prediction models, which themselves have the benefit of assimilated observations as well as (usually) higher resolution.\r\n\r\nAt the Met Office, the same model is used for both daily forecasting and climate prediction, allowing direct comparison between the two systems. Each system brings a unique perspective to model development. The use of state of-the-art variational data assimilation in the forecast model minimises the errors in the large-scale synoptic flow and can allow parametrisation errors to be identified more easily. In addition, comparisons can be made against detailed observational datasets (ARM, TOGA-COARE, GCSS) to investigate individual physical processes. Long climate runs show how a parametrisation behaves in equilibrium and in combination with the rest of the model physics and dynamics. Coupled climate modelling represents a stringent test of the model physics as systematic errors in the atmosphere can feed back on the ocean. Although it is not always the case that model systematic errors are shared between the daily forecast model and the climate model, when this is the case we find that a unified approach to model development is beneficial to both systems.\r\n\r\nExamples of the use of our joint approach to analysing and reducing systematic errors in the Met Office Unified Model are described, with particular reference to the representation of ENSO and the Asian summer monsoon in HadGEM1.

For a summer month (June 2001), the ERA40 reasonably simulates cloud fraction timeseries correlating at 0.87 with the corresponding observed ARM data.  Simulated cloud fractions for the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, however, correlate at only 0.29 missing an extended period of low, thin clouds early in the month.  The JRA-25 cloud fractions correlate with observations at 0.60.  Values of downwelling shortwave flux for all the reanalyses are generally much too high with errors up to 300 Wm -2 during cloudy periods at the daily solar maxima, indicating that the models are not correctly capturing the radiative and/or spatial characteristics of the observed cloud cover.  Downwelling longwave radiative fluxes appear to be more correctly simulated than the shortwave flux when the models correctly simulate cloud fractions (i.e., ERA40 â€“ frequently, NCEP/NCAR â€“ infrequently).  Periods with discrepancies between observed and simulated cloud fractions can have large errors (~75Wm -2 ) in the downwelling radiation flux.  The net effect of clouds on the radiative balance at the polar surface is seen by evaluating the cloud radiative forcing produced by each reanalysis model as a function of season and cloud fraction for each reanalysisâ€™ period of record.  The cloud radiative forcing simulated by all the models agree in a seasonal sense with the signs of the observed forcing: positive during winter, spring and autumn and negative in the summer.  The magnitudes of the cloud radiative forcing decrease linearly as a function of cloud fraction for observations and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, but decrease much more rapidly in the ERA40 and JRA-25 than observations with decreasing cloud fraction.  While these models appear to be more successful in correctly replicating the observed cloud fraction than the NCEP/NCAR model, the simulated clouds in these models may be too optically thin and the models too insensitive to radiative effects of cloud covers less than 80-90%.','2006-12-27 13:51:05'),(53,'Meehl','Gerald','Claudia Tebaldi, Haiyan Teng and Julie Arblaster','Systematic Errors in El Nino Teleconnections and Associated Extreme Events over North America','Meehl_G_1','L','','Systematic Errors in El Nino Teleconnections and Associated Extreme Events over North America\r\n\r\nGerald A.

Individual weather systems and their physical processes can be evaluated against detailed observational datasets (ARM, AMMA,TOGA-COARE etc.). Secondly, the systematic drift of the forecasts from the analysed state can be studied in detail in terms of budgets of heat, momentum, moisture and potential vorticity (PV). In the short-range (0-2 days) this can highlight local errors in parametrized or dynamical processes before errors arising from remote forcing make attribution difficult. The Met Office global NWP version of the Unified Model is close in formulation to that used for climate prediction, providing an ideal testbed for investigating errors in parametrized processes and their relationship to longer term systematic error growth (see contribution from Martin & co-authors for more discussion of climate aspects and idealised modelling).

We use the multilayer canopy model !HMINCER!I (Watanabe et. al., 2006). The model is driven with two atmospheric data set: one is the averaged three typical sunny days in August 1987 at the middle of Japan (case 1), and the other is the average of the data in case 1 (case 2). In the case 1, the variables in the data set have a diurnal variation, whereas they are constant in time in case 2. The integrated shortwave radiation in two cases is the same. The integration time in both cases is 7 days.\r\n\r\nIn case 1, the 7-days averaged sensible heat flux is larger than that in case 2. The increase of turbulent viscosity in case 1 owing to the imbalance in daytime causes large sensible heat flux. As a result, the total energy flux from the canopy top in case 1 is 5 to 6 W m-2 larger than that in case 2. Considering that the radiation forcing by CO2 is estimated as only 1 to 2 W m-2, our result suggests that the diurnal variation of solar radiation may produce the remarkable error of energy flux from canopy model.\r\n','2007-01-26 11:35:45'),(62,'Neale','Rich','','The Role of Convective Moisture Sensitivity in Improving Major Systematic Biases in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM)','Neale_R_1','I','','The Role of Convective Moisture Sensitivity in Improving Major Systematic Biases in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM)\r\n\r\nRichard Neale - Rm 304 - rneale@ucar.edu\r\n http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/rneale \r\n Climate Modelling Section,  CGD,  NCAR\r\n P.O.

Once a GCM\\\'s forecast variables have been interpolated to the SGP observational grid, it thus is feasible to closely evaluate parameterization-dependent processes over a wide range of continental synoptic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe present study focuses on systematic errors in year 2000 model forecasts of surface processes at the SGP site.  Variables of particular interest include surface radiative fluxes and precipitation, as well as model responses to these forcings in the form of surface turbulent fluxes, temperatures, and humidities.   For each season, statistical metrics are used to identify model systematic bias and phase errors in the entire collection of hourly samples of a forecast variable, as well as in its daily averages and mean diurnal cycle. The systematic errors are found to vary substantially according to process, season, and model.  In the summer season, for example, SGP precipitation in CAM3 occurs too frequently, due to an overactive convective scheme, while it is too sparse in AM2, possibly because the observed propagation of convective systems across the SGP region is inadequately captured.  Other instances of systematic errors that illustrate potential parameterization deficiencies in these AGCMs also will be discussed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-02-08 09:38:38'),(69,'Pincus','Robert','','Evaluating Climate Model Simulations of Clouds, Radiation, and  Precipitation','Pincus_R_1','L','','Evaluating Climate Model Simulations of Clouds, Radiation, and Precipitation\r\n\r\nRobert Pincus\r\nClimate Diagnostics Center\r\nNOAA Earth System Research Laboratory\r\n325 S.

Predictions of future climate change are not(yet) verifiable, so model skill must be evaluated by comparing simulations of present-day climate with observations. But how is this comparison to be made? The climate modeling community has no agreed-upon measures of skill, so models are evaluated with a constantly-changing set of criteria. Furthermore, climate models are often assessed by examining both forced modes (i.e. the annual, seasonal, or diurnal cycles) and modes that represent internal variability (i.e. El Nino or the Madden-Julian oscillation). By contrast, the weather forecasting community has a common, well-defined set of metrics for forecasts. Metrics are low-order measures of skill; they indicate model performance (and may not help isolate the root of any model flaws). The metrics useful for short term forecasts, however, are very useful for climate simulations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I\\\'ll present a short hierarchy of metrics for evaluating the simulation of clouds, radiation, and precipitation in the present-day climate. There are three inter-related components: 1) the choice of which variables to examine; 2) the choice of which observations to use; and 3) the choice of which statistics are to be computed. The metrics are simple to compute from low-resolution data(i.e. monthly mean fields of single-level quantities) so models (or versions of models) may be easily compared. I\\\'ll show the metrics for all runs submitted to the IPCC database for the Fourth Assessment as well as two potential ringers, and demonstrate an extension to the diagrams developed by Karl Taylor to summarize three statistical quantities for each model at one time.\r\n','2007-01-26 13:39:42'),(70,'Prather','Michael','','Errors in Tracer Transport, and Convergence to the Exact Answer','Prather_M_1','S','','Errors in Tracer Transport, and Convergence to the Exact Answer\r\n\r\nMichael Prather, UC Irvine\r\n\r\nThe use of tracer transport models in inverse problems or isotopic studies requires a level of accuracy that many current models likely do not meet.  Most numerical methods for tracer transport have only been tested under idealized flows and not under realistic 4-D convergent/divergent flows for which no analytic solution exists.  This work presents a comparison of two different methods under the same flow field: an annual cycle of 3-hour winds from the GISS stratosphere-troposphere general circulation model. The relatively large difference between the two methods is a measure of the transport error in one or both of the methods.  The convergence of both methods as the grid size is successively halved shows a geometric convergence as expected and further allows one to estimate the errors in each schemes as well as demonstrate that both are or are not solving the same problem.  Given the magnitude of the error of the original solution on the native grid, it is likely that transport of scalars is still a notable source of error in climate and NWP models.\r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 10:43:14'),(71,'CANCELLED_Raschke','Ehrhard','Stefan Kinne, Marco Gorgietta, Malte Uphoff and Stephan Bakan','Inconsistencies of the Incoming Solar Radiation Boundary Condition in Global Modeling','Raschke_E_1','I','','Inconsistencies of the Incoming Solar Radiation Boundary Condition in Global Modeling\r\n\r\nEhrhard Raschke1, Stefan Kinne2, Marco Gorgietta2, Malte Uphoff1 and Stephan Bakan2\r\nCenter for Maritime and Atmospheric Sciences, Hamburg\r\nMax Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg\r\n\r\n\r\nWe studied values for the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) as they were prescribed by GCMs participating in AMIP-2 and IPCC model-intercomparison exercises.

Considerable variations for the seasonality of meridional gradients (i.e. difference between zonal averages of each model to a reference) were found, especially during transient seasons.

The operational system comprises a global forecast model based on an icosahedral grid structure and a non-hydrostatic limited area model with a rotated latitude-longitude grid centered over Europe. In addition, a very high resolution limited area model covering Germany and the surrounding region, resolving deep convection explivitely, is currently undergoing pre-operational testing and will serve in the future as a very short range forecast model both in a deterministic frequent update mode and as core component of a limited area ensemble system.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of all components of the system as a continuous monitoring and validation task provides insight in existing model deficiencies, their origins and potential improvements.  One objective of this presentation will be the illustration of the usefulness of intermodel comparative monitoring in the diagnosis of model shortcomings and their relation to specific aspects of the model formulation. For the global model  of DWD it will be demonstrated how the continuous comparison of model products with other forecast centres facilitates the  detection of problems which originate from shortcomings in the formulation of the models multi-layer soil model.  Another subject, which will be discussed in the context of the limited area model of DWD, adresses the relation between systematic positional errors in the precipitation pattern and the choice of prognostic model variables. It will be illustrated, that at a model resolution typical for state-of-the-art limited area models, it is mandatory to include snow and rain as additional prognostic quantities in order to avoid severe systematic errors in the distribution of surface precipitation. Some preliminary results from the pre-operational testing of the very high resolution model test suite will be shown to demonstrate the potential benefits to the forecast quality which may be expected in the near future, when limited area models are able to provide operational forecasts at a horizontal resolution of only a few kilometers. However, it will also be shown, that even at such a resolution, uncertainties in the parametrisation modules employed, e.g. the cloud microphysis scheme, still have a large impact on important forecast products.\r\n\r\n','2007-01-26 14:07:23'),(74,'Robertson','Franklin','Julio Bacmeister and Timothy Miller','Relationships Between Model Tropical Oceanic Precipitation Biases and Surface Energy Fluxes','Robertson_F_1','S','','Relationships Between \r\nModel Tropical Oceanic Precipitation Biases and Surface Energy Fluxes\r\n\r\n1Franklin Robertson, 2Julio Bacmeister and 1Timothy Miller\r\n\r\n1NASA / MSFC, Huntsville, AL\r\n2NASA / GSFC, Greenbelt, MD\r\n Contact: pete.Robertson@nasa.gov\r\n\r\nDespite continued improvements in physical parameterizations in climate models, feedback processes involving radiative fluxes and turbulent energy exchange between the surface and atmosphere remain weak links in coupled climate modeling.  Because precipitation structure and its variability, particularly over the tropical oceans, is an end result of these energy exchanges, it too has been a persistent trouble spot for \\\"AMIP-like\\\" simulations (i.e. specified SST) and coupled models alike.  The propensity for \\\"double ITCZ\\\" configurations over the Pacific and poor rainfall simulations over the Indian Ocean and Asian Monsoon region are typical examples.  In this work we use output from AR4 AMIP and coupled model integrations, along with experiments with the new NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office GEOS-5 AGCM to study relationships between poor precipitation simulations and the behavior of energy fluxes at the surface and at TOA.  \r\n\r\nIn particular, we consider the role of latent heat flux and SW cloud forcing in controlling SST gradients and examine modes by which associated moist static energy transports link these flux processes and precipitation.  C20C and AMIP integrations are the primary data sets used to characterize systematic differences in these relationships.  One possibility for explaining poor precipitation structure in AMIP integrations is that an exaggerated wind-evaporation feedback develops when the link between AGCM fluxes and SST evolution is disabled.  Several experiments using the NASA GEOS-5 model are also used.  In one experiment type observed surface wind speeds from reanalyses are used in the model bulk aerodynamic formula to ensure a more direct link between SST and fluxes.  A second experiment type involves initializing the model from an assimilation cycle, but then integrating in \\\"climate mode\\\" and examining the evolution of systematic biases over several days as the model drifts toward its climatology. These model diagnostics are supplemented with statistics of radiative and turbulent flux relationships derived largely from global satellite measurements (e.g. ISCCP-FD radiation, HOAPS latent heat flux, GPCP precipitation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2006-12-07 10:07:17'),(75,'Rodwell','Mark','Tim Palmer ','Using NWP to Assess Climate Models','Rodwell_M_1','S','','Using NWP to Assess Climate Models\r\n\r\nM. Rodwell and T. N. Palmer\r\n\r\nEstimates of climate change remain uncertain - hampering strategic decision making in many sectors. In large part this uncertainty arises from uncertainty in the computational representation of known physical processes. This model component of climate change uncertainty is increasingly being assessed using perturbed model experiments. Some such model perturbations have, for example, led to headline global warming estimates of as much as 11K. These experiments consider many differently perturbed versions of a given base model and assess the likelihood of each perturbed model\\\'s climate prediction based on how well it simulates present-day climate. In these experiments, the computational cost of the model assessment is extremely high unless one assumes that the climate anomalies associated with different model perturbations can be combined linearly. Here we demonstrate a different method that harnesses the power of the data assimilation system to directly assess the perturbed physics of a model. Data assimilation involves the incorporation of daily observations to produce initial conditions (analyses) for numerical weather prediction(NWP). The method used here quantifies systematic initial tendencies in the first few timesteps of a model forecast. After suitable temporal meaning, these initial tendencies imply imbalances in the physical processes associated with model error. We show how these tendencies can be used to produce probability weightings for each model that could be used in the construction of p.d.f.s of climate change. The approach typically costs 5% of the cost of a 100-year coupled model simulation that might otherwise be used to assess the simulation of present-day climate. Importantly, since the approach is amenable to linear analysis, it could further reduce the cost of model assessment by several orders of magnitude: making the exercise computationally feasible. The initial tendency approach is only able to assess \\\"fast physics\\\" perturbations, i.e. perturbations that have an impact on weather forecasts as well as climate. Recent publications suggest that the majority of present model parameter uncertainty is associated with fast physics. If such a test were adopted, the assessment of the ability or a model to simulate present-day climate would only be required for models that \\\"pass\\\" the fast physics test. The study highlights the advantages of a more seamless approach to forecasting that combines numerical weather prediction, climate forecasting and all scales in-between.\r\n\r\n','2007-01-26 14:15:33'),(76,'Romanou','Natassa','','Turbulent Fluxes at the Surface of the Ocean from Models and Observations','Romanou_A_1','I','','Turbulent Fluxes at the Surface of the Ocean from Models and Observations\r\n\r\nAnastasia (Natassa) Romanou\r\nDept of Applied Physics and Applied Math.,\r\nColumbia University\r\nand NASA-Goddard Institute for Space Studies,\r\nArmstrong Hall Rm 330B,\r\n2880 Broadway,\r\nNew York, NY 10025.\r\ntel. 212/678-5520\r\nfax. 212/678-5550\r\nwww.giss.nasa.gov/~romanou\r\n\r\nLatent heat flux is an important term in the heat and energy balance and the water cycle over the ocean.

Instead, we consider the distribution of outcomes within three sets of model runs grouped according to the amount of global warming they simulate: <2?C (including committed climate change simulations), 2-3?C, and >3?C. Here, we are contrasting two different methods for calculating the risks: first we use an equal weighting approach giving every model within one of the three sets the same weight, and second, we weight the models according to their ability to model ENSO.

An important aspect of the analysis was how different parts of parameter space were weighted according to their ability to simulate present-day climate. \r\n\r\nSince then, the method for generating probabilistic predictions has been improved by adopting a similar but more rigorous Bayesian methodology developed by statisticians in the field of Computer Experiments. We describe the way in which the Bayesian approach deals with observations used to constrain the probabilistic predictions. It allows us to use lots of different observations to weight parts of parameter space according to model quality and we explain why we favour this multivariate approach.  The Bayesian framework introduces a new term into the weighting function, called discrepancy, which quantifies the degree of imperfection in the model\\\'s representation of the real climate system. Given the size of systematic errors in the current generation of climate models, this term has important consequences for what we can say about the future climate. \r\n\r\nWe use the AR4 multimodel ensemble to provide a \\\'proxy\\\' estimate of the magnitude of the discrepancy term and show what affect it has on our probabilistic predictions.

A general and consistent framework must be developed that allows the evaluation of coupled, ensemble climate models that include single run climate simulations, off-line model simulations, models of remote sensing retrievals, observation-based teleconnections, and model-observation predictability studies that cross scales. To this end we have developed a Bayesian statistical framework, to assess the predictability of the global water and energy cycles and evaluate models not only in terms of idealized predictability but also in their skill in predicting climate variability, including feedbacks and teleconnections.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the system requires the estimation of the joint distribution between a measure of the model\\\'s prediction (e.g. the ensemble mean) and observations (or the measure that the model predictions are being compared to). The joint distribution is estimated using Copulas that have the advantage that the joint distribution can be estimated from the marginal distributions and a measure of dependency between the variables. The predictability skill is represented by the conditional distribution function for the predictive state conditional on a model prediction. Given skillful climate model predictions, this conditional distribution will have less variability that the distribution of the climate variable prior to the model predictions.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we present some results focusing on the states and main fluxes of the terrestrial water and energy cycles and derived quantities such as drought indices and extreme values. Firstly we look at the idealized model predictability or self-reproducibility, within their own climate system, using the long-term climate simulations from the IPCC 20th century and control simulations. The analysis provides an upper limit of predictability as a function of boundary conditions (20C3m and AMIP data) and how this varies globally and the temporal and spatial scales of predictability, recognizing that predictive skill may only be attained as we move to coarser scales. Secondly we show examples of model ability to predict observed climate connectivity for well known ENSO patterns as well as lesser known connections that are more difficult to model.

The response of two independently developed AGCMs is compared, and then the dependence of the response on horizontal resolution and on a single tuning parameter, related to orographic gravity wave drag, is determined. Across these levels of comparison, the  tropical and subtropical response is generally robust in zonal wind and temperature, but the extratropical response is non-robust. On regional scales, almost every aspect of the response appears to be non-robust, even to the simple variation of the gravity-wave drag parameter. Some evidence that the non-robustness of the simulated response to global warming might be predicted from the (non global-warmed) control simulation is presented: in particular, those parts of the response that are non-robust to a parameter variation tend to behave in a non-linear fashion under a similar variation in the control run.\r\n','2007-01-26 15:52:27'),(85,'Srinivasan','J.','Ravi S.Nanjundiah and V.Vidyunmala','Analysis of the Errors in the Simulation of  Indian Monsoon  Rainfall in  IPCC AR4 Simulations of the 20th Century Climate','Srinivasan_J_1','I','','Analysis of the Errors in the Simulation of Indian Monsoon  Rainfall in IPCC AR4 simulations of the 20th Century Climate\r\n\r\nJ.Srinivasan , Ravi S.Nanjundiah and V.Vidyunmala\r\nCentre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences\r\nIndian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India 560012\r\n\r\nThe accurate simulation of monsoon rainfall by atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCM) and Coupled Ocean Atmosphere GCM have not been achieved so far. Hence it is necessary to understand the factors that lead to poor simulation of monsoon rainfall in GCM.  We have used a simple diagnostic model to identify the sources of error in the simulation of   Indian monsoon rainfall by IPCC AR4 simulation of the 20th century climate. We have examined the results from 12 coupled models in the IPCC archive along with simulations of the 12 AGCM  that used observed SST as the boundary condition. A comparison of the results of coupled model along with that of AGCM helps in understanding how the ocean-atmosphere coupling influences the simulation of the monsoon. In 11 of the 12 coupled models, the Indian monsoon is weaker the coupled simulation when compared to the simulation by the AGCM that used observed SST. This is because in almost all the coupled models the SST is lower than observed. The diagnostic model relates the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere, integrated water vapor and vertical stability to monsoon rainfall. We show that in many GCM the relationship between rainfall and integrated water vapor is quite different from observations.   For the same value of integrated water vapor, the models simulate higher rainfall than observations. Hence in simulation wherein SST is specified from observations (AMIP like simulations) the monsoon rainfall simulated by these models tends to be too high. When these AGCM are coupled to an OGCM they tend to produce realistic rainfall because the SST in the coupled model simulation is colder than the observations. The colder SST leads to a lower integrated water vapor over the Arabian sea. This leads to less advection of water vapor from ocean to land and hence reduces the monsoon rainfall in coupled simulations. Hence an accurate simulation of monsoon rainfall by coupled models could be on account of fortuitous cancellation of errors.  In some GCM the atmosphere is vertically more unstable than observations. In such models, small increase in integrated water vapor leads to a large difference in the simulated monsoon rainfall. In the Africa, some of the models tend to produce high a rainfall in the Sahel region because the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere is much higher than observations.\r\n','2007-01-26 16:35:39'),(86,'Stainforth','David','','Uncertainty and Confidence in Climate Forecasting','Staniforth_D_1','L','','Uncertainty and Confidence in Climate Forecasting\r\n\r\nD.

It is important however, to acknowledge the fundamental differences between weather forecasting and climate forecasting. In particular a weather forecasting system can be verified and improved by repeated tests in a way which is simply impossible for climate forecasts.\r\n \r\nTo maintain the long term credibility of climate science it is crucial to acknowledge the barriers to climate forecasts, whether they be one-off, \\\"what if\\\", scenarios or distributions of possibilities. We can thus examine the basis for claiming confidence in statements about future climate. At global scales constraints may be relatively simple and supported by basic physics. At regional scales the theoretical issues are much more complex.\r\n \r\nThe grand ensembles of climateprediction.net combine large initial condition enembles and with large perturbed parameter enembles and enable us to begin to examine the range and sources of uncertainty in climate predictions. Here we discuss five sources of uncertainty in climate forecasting and their implications for future experimental design. These uncertainties are illustrated with result from the climateprediction.net ensembles. The implications for observational strategies are discussed as well as methods of extracting robust and potentially valuable information on the 20 to 50 year timescale.\r\n','2007-01-26 16:38:00'),(87,'Stenke','Andrea','Volker Grewe, Michael Ponater and Robert Sausen','Lagrangian Transport of Water Vapor and Cloud Water in the ECHAM4 GCM and Its Impact on the Cold Bias','Stenke_A_1','L','','Lagrangian Transport of Water Vapor and Cloud Water in the ECHAM4 GCM and Its Impact on the Cold Bias\r\n\r\nAndrea Stenke, Volker Grewe, Michael Ponater and Robert Sausen\r\n\r\nThe Lagrangian advection scheme ATTILA has been applied for the transport of water vapor and cloud water in the general circulation model (GCM) ECHAM4.L39(DLR) (E39) instead of the operational semi-Lagrangian transport scheme (SLT). ATTILA is a purely Lagrangian scheme that is numerically non-diffusive and strictly mass conserving, while the operational semi-Lagrangian scheme exhibits a considerable numerical diffusion in the presence of sharp gradients. So far, ATTILA has been applied for the transport of passive tracers exclusively. The model version E39/SLT significantly overestimates the water vapor mixing ratio in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere by a factor of 3-5 compared to HALOE observations (`wet bias\\\'). Compared to E39/SLT, E39/ATTILA shows substantially reduced water vapor mixing ratios in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere by about 70%, and a steeper meridional water vapor gradient in the subtropics which is in better agreement with observations. Furthermore, the temperature distribution as simulated with E39/SLT is characterized by a pronounced cold temperature bias in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere (`cold bias\\\'), a problem which is present in many other atmospheric GCMs. Furthermore, E39/SLT shows a cold temperature bias in the polar stratosphere above 50 hPa in winter (`cold pole\\\'). The improvements concerning the water vapor distribution in E39/ATTILA lead to a substantial reduction of the simulated cold bias by approximately 5-7 K, i.e. half of the cold bias in E39/SLT is caused by the wet bias in the lowermost stratosphere. Furthermore, the reduced temperature error results in a better representation of the modeled tropopause, especially in the extratropics. Sensitivity studies indicate that the warming of the extratropical lowermost stratosphere in E39/ATTILA is directly related to the reduced wet bias resulting in a less infrared cooling. Additionally, the cold pole problem is also slightly reduced in E39/ATTILA by approximately 2-5 K. The transport of water vapor and cloud water with the Lagrangian transport scheme ATTILA constitutes a major improvement compared to E39/SLT with respect to modeled water vapor and, as a consequence, modeled temperatures and dynamics.\r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 10:46:18'),(88,'Stephens','Graeme','Todd Ellis','New Emerging Global Data Sets for Examining Global-Scale Controls on Precipitation and Evaluating the Representation of Clouds and Precipitation in Weather and Climate Models','Stephens_G_1','I','','New Emerging Global Data Sets for Examining Global-Scale Controls on Precipitation and Evaluating the Representation of Clouds and Precipitation in Weather and Climate Models\r\n\r\nGraeme L.

The processes and feedbacks that control the cold-tongue, however, are not well understood. The state of-the-art coupled general circulation models (GCMs) have a tendency to develop an excessive cold-tongue in the equatorial Pacific.   To better understand the feedbacks in  this region and in particular to test the hypothesis that the tendency for the coupled GCMs to develop an excessive cold-tongue is due to a weak  regulating effect from the model atmosphere, we have  quantified the feedbacks in the equatorial Pacific in nine leading atmospheric GCMs using the ENSO signal in that region, and compared with the corresponding calculations from observations.\r\n\r\nThe net atmospheric feedback over the equatorial Pacific in the two GFDL models is found to be  comparable to the observed value. All other models are found to have a weaker negative net feedback from the atmosphere-a weaker regulating effect on the underlying SST than the real atmosphere. Except for the  French (IPSL) model, a weaker negative feedback from the cloud albedo and a weaker negative feedback from the atmospheric transport are the two leading contributors to the weaker regulating effect from the atmosphere. The underestimate of the strength of the negative feedbacks by the models is apparently linked to an underestimate of the equatorial precipitation response.\r\n\r\nAll models have a stronger water vapor feedback than that indicated in Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)observations. These results confirm the suspicion that an underestimate of the regulatory effect from the atmosphere over the equatorial Pacific region is a prevalent problem. The results also suggest, however, that a weaker regulatory effect from the atmosphere is unlikely solely responsible for the development of an excessive cold tongue in all models. The need to validate the feedbacks from the ocean transport is therefore highlighted.\r\n','2007-02-07 10:49:55'),(92,'Takeuchi','Yoshiaki','','Systematic Error in Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasts from Operational Global Models','Takeuchi_Y_1','S','','Systematic Error in Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasts from Operational Global Models\r\n\r\nYoshiaki Takeuchi\r\nNumerical Prediction Division, Japan Meteorological Agency\r\n\r\nIn 1991, WGNE launched an intercomparison activity on typhoon track forecasts in the western North Pacific area given by operational global NWP models of ECMWF, UKMO and JMA.

The systematic changes in the properties of the ENSO with increasing amplitude confirm that ENSO in HadCM3 is prevalently a surface (or SST) mode. The tropical Pacific SST variability in the coupled integrations correlates strongly with the SST variability in the corresponding ensemble of slab runs with the same atmospheric parameter perturbations. Comparison with the respective couped ENSO-neutral and slab climatologies indicates low-cloud cover to be an important controlling factor of the strength of the ENSO in HadCM3.

Composite analysis requires that we identify and track individual cyclones. \r\n\r\nThe compositing itself partitions the precipitation field into synoptic-sized regions surrounding tracked cyclones and precipitation falling everywhere else. Among the final products of this process is a map showing the percentage contribution that changes in cyclone activity or behavior make to the regional change in precipitation.

These compositing techniques are then applied to output from IPCC AR4 model runs to test whether these climate models reliably express the particular cyclone behaviors that were previously identified as the source of the precipitation change. For this, we use reanalysis results as a proxy for real world cyclone activity and map coincident observations onto these cyclones in an attempt to validate the models.

The impact of basic state biases on monsoon behaviour at intraseasonal timescales is assessed using an annual cycle of heat flux adjustments applied to the equatorial Indo-Pacific Ocean surface of a further coupled integration.  While the temporal evolution of modes seems unaffected, the spatial representation, particularly of  the 30-60 day mode, is improved.  EOF analysis is used to investigate the complex relationship between intraseasonal and interannual variation.  When the bias is partially corrected through flux adjustment, the spatio-temporal evolution of ENSO is improved, with notable benefits for the monsoon-ENSO teleconnection. Modes of variability common to both integrations at intraseasonal timescales are more dramatically perturbed by ENSO forcing in the flux adjusted experiment, demonstrating that systematic model error not only denigrates interannual variability but also its relationship to intraseasonal behaviour.\r\n','2007-02-02 13:16:06'),(99,'Turner','A.G.','P.M.

Both the mean seasonal precipitation and its interannual variation are found to increase in the future climate scenario presented. Systematic errors in current climate simulations of the coupled system prevent accurate representation of the monsoon-ENSO teleconnection, of prime importance for seasonal prediction and for determining monsoon interannual variability. By applying seasonally varying heat flux adjustments to the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean surface in the future climate simulation, some assessment can be made of the impact of systematic model error on future climate scenarios. In simulations where the flux adjustments are implemented, the response to climate change is magnified, with the suggestion that systematic biases may be masking the true impact of increased greenhouse gas forcing. The teleconnection between ENSO and the Asian summer monsoon remains robust in the future climate, although the relationship takes on more of a biennial character in the flux adjusted simulation. \r\n\r\nSystematic biases have more impact on the teleconnection than variations in CO2 forcing.

The steep orography at the edge of the continent and along the Antarctic Peninsula is difficult to represent realistically with the relatively coarse resolution of the current models. The smoothing applied to the orography results in orographic enhancement of the precipitation over the ocean giving a negative bias to the surface mass balance across the continent.\r\n\r\nThe coastal region is characterised by complex air-sea-ice interactions that are also difficult to represent realistically. Increasingly sophisticated sea ice dynamics parameterisations have been included in many models over the last few years. However, experiments suggest that errors in the broadscale near-surface flow can induce large errors in the sea ice extent regardless of the sea ice parameterisation scheme used. The third generation Hadley Centre coupled climate model (HadCM3) has a large negative sea ice anomaly over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea (ABS) just to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. This is a very important region to have represented correctly as temperatures on the western side of the peninsula have increased more than anywhere else on Earth over the last 50 years. The sea ice anomaly is a result of a negative MSLP errors over the ABS. This in turn has been attributed to positive sea-surface temperature errors over the tropical, eastern sides of the major ocean basins as a result of there being too little cloud.\r\n\r\nThe IPCC Assessment Report 4 (AR 4) simulations of the Earth\\\'s climate over the last 50 years and projections for the next century provide an extremely valuable resource for investigating past climate change and assessing possible changes in the future.

In the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM), the strength of atmospheric convection depends on the convective available potential energy (CAPE), as controlled by a \\\"CAPE timescale\\\". Experiments show that if a short CAPE timescale is chosen, the convection shows an unrealistic, intermittent behaviour, also resulting in poor radiation cloud interaction, especially over the tropical oceans. Further, convection is very vigurous during single timesteps and on average maximum convective precipitation starts too early in the diurnal cycle over land.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we show results from two experiments: (a) in the standard configuration, the CAPE timescale depends linearly on relative humidity, but the CAPE timescale is limited to be at most 1 hour; (b) the CAPE timescale depends inversely on the ambient vertical velocity, allowing weaker convection to develop, with a CAPE timescale of up to 6 hours in the limit of no vertical velocity. The intermittent behaviour of convection decreases and convective clouds are more abundant in the second experiment, because the convection is allowed to be less intense. The weaker convection in the second experiment delays the diurnal cycle of convective precipitation by a few hours both over land and ocean. Precipitation variability increases over several land regions, which indicates that the weaker convection allows moist static energy build up over land, before an early afternoon release by convection. The poor timing and variability of precipitation in the standard UM configuration had already been shown to cause unrealistically low coupling between land surface and atmosphere; we argue that improving precipitation distribution also improves plant physiology indicators.\r\n\r\n','2007-02-02 13:55:44'),(102,'Volodin','Evgeny',' ','Systematic Errors in Tropical Cloud Distribution and Climate Sensitivity','Volodin_E_1','L','','Systematic Errors in Tropical Cloud Distribution and Climate Sensitivity\r\n\r\nEvgeny Volodin, Institute for Numerical Mathematics, Moscow, Russia\r\n\r\nVertical distribution of tropical cloudiness in AR4 models is studied in connection with model climate sensitivity.

An analysis of 3-hourly rainfall from the CMIP3 GFDL CM2.1 climate of the 20th century simulation indicates that this model reproduces the observed modulation.\r\n','2007-02-08 09:51:07'),(105,'Wang','Wanqiu','Pingping Xie, Wayne Higgins, Meghan Cronin, Phillip Arkin, and Robert Weller','The Warm Bias in the Southeastern Pacific in the NCEP CFS Model','Wang_W_1','I','','The Warm Bias in the Southeastern Pacific in the NCEP CFS Model\r\n\r\nWanqiu Wang, Pingping Xie, Wayne Higgins, Meghan Cronin, Phillip Arkin, and Robert Weller\r\n\r\nAs in many contemporary coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, there exists a sea surface temperature(SST) warm bias in the Southeastern Pacific (SEP) in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)coupled Climate Forecast System (CFS) model.

S. Department of Energy and the China Ministry of Sciences and Technology, has compiled several high resolution 1,000-2,000 years proxy climate data sets. The data have been used to study long-term climate variability, and more recently to evaluate GCM simulations of East Asia climate, with the notion that confidence in using the models for future climate prediction will be much enhanced if the same models possess the ability to simulate both the present and past climates.  However, there are issues in comparing model simulations with proxy data.  For example, the proxy data are area averaged anomalies, while the model simulations, at present, are quantitative in coarse-grid resolution.  In addition, the proxy data include implicitly the climate forcing factors (solar variation, volcanic aerosols, greenhouse gases, etc.) while model simulations used the prescribed forcing with uncertainties.  \r\n\r\nHere we present findings of a comparative study of the proxy data and several coupled model simulations including NCAR CCSM and BCC models for historical periods, and IPCC AR4 models for the past 150 years.  In addition to climate  variability, we also examine the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature and precipitation patterns for two periods, 1635-1646 and 1808-1819 during which large volcanic eruptions occurred.  Note that during the first period eastern China experienced exceptional and persistent droughts while substantial cooling was recorded during the second period.

The CFS is a fully coupled atmosphere-land-ocean model.  The atmospheric component is the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) model operational in 2003.  It is intended that future versions of the CFS will use the same atmospheric model as the GFS.  Development of an improved version of the CFS is underway; extended AMIP and CMIP integrations of different versions of the CFS are being carried out and evaluated.  This paper will focus on the results of extended AMIP and CMIP integrations.\r\n\r\nThe currently operational CFS has T62 spectral resolution with 64 layers in the vertical.  In developing the CFS, it was found that increasing the number of vertical layers from 28 to 64 layers in CMIP integrations produced a substantially more realistic simulation of the equatorial Pacific, reducing a cold bias in SST along the equator.  The 28 level model had much more precipitation in the east Pacific ITCZ, too strong surface stress over the equatorial Pacific and too much upwelling near the equator in the east Pacific.  (The number of vertical layers had much less effect on the performance of AMIP integrations.)  However, increased vertical resolution also resulted in decreased stratus clouds and increased warm SST biases in the eastern subtropical oceans.\r\n\r\nThe NCEP CFS has stronger surface radiative fluxes, evaporation and precipitation than in independent estimates.  On-going experiments with higher horizontal resolution (T126) in the atmosphere suggest that surface stresses in the eastern equatorial Pacific are somewhat too weak.  Surface fluxes and cloudiness also appear sensitive to horizontal resolution.\r\n\r\nThe currently operational GFS atmospheric model has been tested at T126 resolution in extended CMIP integrations.  Both the operational CFS and GFS produce global cooling of 2-meter air temperature in extended coupled integrations, but the GFS produces more severe cooling and a drier atmosphere, reflecting reductions in vertical diffusion.  Replacing the sigma vertical coordinate with a hybrid vertical coordinate seems to improve the GFS performance.  \r\n','2007-02-07 11:09:47'),(110,'White','Glenn','J. Alpert, K. Campana, M.

Currently 16-day forecasts are generated four times a day.  The skill of 5-day forecasts of 500 hPa heights has doubled in 2 decades.  Two decades ago the GFS exhibited useful forecast skill out to 5 days for 500 hPa heights; today it exhibits useful skill out to 7.5 days.  Examination and reduction of systematic errors have helped to improve global forecasts.  This talk examines reductions in systematic errors over the last two decades in the GFS, the effect of recent improvements in the treatment of diffusion and mountain forcing and recent work on short-range forecast errors and comparisons of systematic errors in the GFS and other operational global forecast systems.\r\n\r\nExamining short-range forecast errors offers insight into model problems before nonlinear effects obscure the source of errors, but is frequently complicated by uncertainty whether the short-range errors reflect model or analysis problems.  Comparison of analyses and short-range forecasts to observations can help, but is limited by errors in the observations themselves and by the uneven distribution of observations.  \r\n\r\nComparison of time-averaged analyses and forecasts by the GFS to the same fields from other operational numerical weather prediction centers has also been used to expose problems in the GFS.  ?Transplant? experiments in which analyses from one operational center are used to initialize forecasts with the global model of another center are run to clarity the relative roles of the assimilation system and forecast model in causing model errors.  Significant time-mean differences in the tropical analyses and forecasts between the GFS and other centers were found to reflect differences in the forecast model rather than the assimilation.    \r\n\r\nTwo recent short-range systematic errors in the GFS have been negative height errors over orography and a weakening of the jet maxima.  Enhanced mountain blocking and reduced diffusion in the free atmosphere were tested and found to reduce these errors and to improve forecast skill in the Northern Hemisphere.  These changes were implemented in mid-2005.  Recent problems in the Southern Hemisphere are currently being investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n','2007-02-02 15:23:34'),(111,'Wild','Martin','','Systematic Errors in GCM Simulated Radiation Budgets Infered from Surface Observations','Wild_M_1','L','','Systematic Errors in GCM Simulated Radiation Budgets Infered from Surface Observations \r\n\r\nMartin Wild\r\nInstitute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, ETH Zurich, Universitaetsstr. 16, CH-8092 Zurich,\r\nSwitzerland (martin.wild@env.ethz.ch)\r\n\r\nSubstantial uncertainties still exist on the distribution of radiative energy within the climate system, and accordingly in General Circulation Models. For example, absorption of solar radiation in the atmophere of current GCMs varies by more than 30% even under cloud-free conditions. To constrain these uncertainties, we use radiation observation at the surface from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) and Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) located at ETH Zurich.  These data are used to systematically assess the radiative fluxes of various GCMs, representing almost two decades of model development, from the atmospheric model intercomparison projects AMIP I and AMIP II to the-state-of-the art models participating in the 4th IPCC Assessment Report (AR4).\r\n\r\nResults show that models up to now tend to overestimate the solar irradiance, due to a lack of shortwave absorption in the atmosphere. The excessive surface insolation is also found under cloud-free conditions in many models, while improvements are found in some of the latest AR4 models with higher atmospheric absorption. The most difficult component to model in the longwave is the downward longwave flux at the surface. Accordingly, large discrepancies exist in the global means of this component in the GCMs, both under all sky and clear sky conditions. A comparison with available observations suggests that the IPCC AR4 GCMs tend to systematically underestimate  the longwave downward flux.  The downward longwave flux at the surface is a particularly interesting component in the context of climate change, as it is  most directly affected by changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases. GCMs predict the downward longwave flux to undergo the largest changes of all energy and radiation balance components. Observed changes in these fluxes sare in line with the model predictions, increasing confidence in our understanding of the greenouse effect.  \r\n\r\nRecent evidence suggests that the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth surface is not stable over time but exhibits significant decadal variations. These variations, in addition to the changes in longwave radiation induced by alterations in greenhouse gases, cause changes in radiative forcings which may significantly affect surface climate. Observations suggest that surface solar radiation, after decades of dimming, reversed into a brightening since the mid 1980s at widespread locations. These changes are in line with a recovery of atmospheric transparency, possibly related to reduced aerosol loadings due to air pollution control and the breakdown of industry in formerly Communist countries. Current GCMs typically do not represent aerosol effects with a degree of sophistication to capture these effects. Here  we use a special version of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology GCM (ECHAM5-HAM), which includes aerosol effects in more detail than in most other GCMs. Due to the improved treatment of aerosol effects, the model is able to reproduce the observed trend reversal under cloud-free conditions realistically.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRecent related references:\r\n\r\nWild, M., Ohmura, A., Gilgen, H., and Rosenfeld, D., 2004: On the consistency of trends in radiation and\r\ntemperature records and implications for the global hydro-logical cycle.

In general, the cloud regime properties are found to be similar at all forecast times, including the climatological mean.  This suggests that weaknesses in the representation of fast local processes are responsible for errors in the simulation of the cloud regimes.  The increased horizontal resolution of the model used for numerical weather prediction generally has little impact on the cloud regimes, although the simulation of tropical shallow cumulus is improved, whilst the relative frequency of tropical deep convection and cirrus compare less favourably with observations.

Results are used to evaluate the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast Systems (GFS) parameterization and the MODIS-based satellite retrievals as described in a few recent studies. The influence of clouds on surface albedo and the albedo difference between morning and afternoon observations are also investigated. A new approach is taken to partition the observed upward flux so that the direct-beam and diffuse-beam albedos can be separately computed. The study focused first on the ARM Southern Great Plains Central Facility site. It is found that the diffuse-beam albedo prescribed in the NCEP GFS matched closely with  the observations. The direct-beam albedo parameterized in the GFS is largely underestimated at all SZAs. The parameterizations derived from the MODIS product largely underestimated the direct-beam albedo at large SZAs and slightly overestimated it at small SZAs. Similar results are obtained from the analyses of observations at other stations. Attempts are made to improve numerical model algorithms that parameterize the direct-beam albedo as a product of the direct-beam albedo at SZA= 60 deg (or the diffuse-beam albedo), which varies with surface type or geographical location and/or season, and a function that depends only on SZA. Such functions derived from nine ARM and SURFRAD stations show similar dependencies on SZA. These stations are situated on pasture, grassland, cropland, bare soil and rocky desert. A method is presented for computing the direct-beam albedos over all snow-free land points without referring to a particular land-cover classification scheme, which often differs from model to model.\r\n','2007-02-02 16:17:49'),(116,'Yokohata','T.','S.

In particular, we focused on ocean heat uptake (OHU), which plays an important role in determining TCR.\r\n\r\nThe Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) is an AOGCM developed by the Center for Climate System Research (CCSR) at the University of Tokyo, the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), and the Frontier Research Center for Global Change (FRCGC). MIROC 3.2 has two versions with different resolutions, high (Hi-Res, atmospheric horizontal resolution of approximately 100 km) and medium (Mid-Res, approximately 300 km), and the TCR of the former is higher than that of the latter. According to Yokohata et al. 2006, one of the reasons for the different TCR in the two versions is caused by the difference in OHU: Since the Hi-Res version has stronger stratification and thinner mixed layer depth (MLD) compared to the Mid-Res version, it has a smaller OHU and thus a larger TCR. This result suggests that MLD simulated by climate models can play an important role in determining OHU. Therefore, models with more realistic MLD may provide a more reliable estimation of OHU in future climate projections.\r\n\r\nThe present study examined the relationship between OHU and MLD simulated by the climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth assessment report (AR4).

The seasonal behavior of the SAH is presented for each model. Analyses of the results show that all models are able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of the SAH. Locations of the SAH center are also basically reproduced by these models. Most of the models underestimate the intensity and the extension of coverage all year round except NCAR CCSM3. The anomalous SAH can be divided into east and west modes according to its longitude location in summer on the interannual time scale, and the composite anomalies of the observed precipitation for these two modes tend to have opposite sign over the East Asia.\r\n\r\nHowever, only several coupled GCMs can simulate the similar relationship between rainfall and SAH as observed, which may be associated with the bias in simulation of the subtropical anticyclone over West Pacific (SAWP) at 500hpa. In fact, we found that any coupled GCM, which can reproduce the reasonable summer mean state of SAWP and southward (northward) withdrawal (extension) for the east (west) mode of SAH as observed, will also simulate similar rainfall anomaly pattern for the east and west SAH modes over the East Asia. Further analysis indicates that the observed variations in the SAH, SWAP and rainfall are closely related to the sea surface temperature (SST) over the equatorial tropical Pacific, Particularly, some models can not simulate the SAWP with extending northward in west mode and withdrawing southward in the east mode, which may be related to weak major El  or La  events. The abilities of the coupled GCMs to simulate the SAWP and ENSO events associate partly with reproducing the observed relationship between SAH and rainfall anomaly over the East Asia.\r\n','2007-02-07 11:13:29'),(118,'Yu','Jin-Yi','Hsun-Ying Kao','Using a Two-Oscillator View to Examine the CGCM Deficiency in ENSO Simulations','YU_JY_1','L','','Using a Two-Oscillator View to Examine the CGCM Deficiency in ENSO Simulations\r\n\r\nJin-Yi Yu and Hsun-Ying Kao\r\nDepartment of Earth System Science\r\nUniversity of California, Irvine\r\nIrvine, CA 92697-3100\r\n\r\nBy analyzing ENSO persistence barrier in the past four decades (1958-2001), we propose that the ENSO cycle consists of two different oscillators: a central Pacific oscillator which is forced by atmospheric forcing and an eastern Pacific oscillator which is resulted from the air sea interaction involving the thermocline variation in the cold tongue. When the basic state (such as the thermocline depth) changes, the eastern Pacific oscillator is affected and its onset time changes from decadal to decade. But the western Pacific oscillator is not sensitive to the thermocline depth and maintain its onset time in Spring. As a result, ENSO SST anomalies propagates from eastern to central Pacific in some decades (e.g., before 1976/77) but from central to eastern Pacific in the other decades (e.g., after 1976/77).\r\n\r\nThis view is used to explain the excessive biennial tendency in the NCAR CCSM3\\\'s ENSO simulations. We argue that because the CCSM can not produce the annual cycle of the eastern Pacific cold tongue, this model can not produce the eastern Pacific oscillator. In stead, the ENSO cycle produce by the CCSM is dominated by the western Pacific oscillator. In the CCSM, this oscillator is over sensitive to the forcing from Indian monsoon and becomes too strong in the biennial timescale. Based on our view, the excessive biennial ENSO tendency in the CCSM is a separate issue from the lack of a low-frequency (~4 years) component of ENSO in the model. Reducing the biennial ENSO does not necessary lead to the production of a stronger 4 year ENSO. The lack of the 4-year ENSO component is tied to the model performance of cold tongue simulation. The excessive 2-year ENSO component is tied to the model performance of monsoon simulation.\r\n\r\nEvidences from observational analyses and CCSM experiments will be presented to support our view.\r\n','2007-02-08 09:42:14'),(119,'Zhang','Chidong','Min Dong, Silvio Gualdi, Harry H.

Slow eastward propagation of the MJO, especially in low-level zonal wind, is realistic in all these simulations. However, the simulated MJO suffers from several common problems. The MJO signal in precipitation is generally too weak and often eroded by an unrealistic split of an equatorial maximum of precipitation into a double ITCZ structure over the western Pacific. The MJO signal in low-level zonal wind, on the other hand, is sometimes too strong over the eastern Pacific but too weak over the Indian Ocean. The observed phase relationship between precipitation and low level zonal wind associated with the MJO in the western Pacific and their coherence in general are not reproduced by the models. The seasonal migration in latitude of MJO activity is missing in most simulations. Air-sea coupling generally strengthens the simulated eastward propagating signal, but its effects on the phase relationship and coherence between precipitation and low-level zonal wind, and on their geographic distributions, seasonal cycles, and interannual variability are inconsistent among the simulations. Such inconsistency cautions generalization of results from MJO simulations using a single model. In comparison to observations, biases in the simulated MJO appear to be related to biases in the background state of mean precipitation, low-level zonal wind, and boundary-layer moisture convergence. This study concludes that, while the realistic simulations of the eastward propagation of the MJO are encouraging, reproducing other fundamental features of the MJO by current global models remains an unmet challenge.\r\n','2007-02-08 09:44:00'),(120,'Zhang','Xiangdong','','Arctic Sea Ice Simulations and Projections by the IPCC AR4 Climate Models: Credibility and Systematic Bias','Zhang_X_1','L','','Arctic Sea Ice Simulations and Projections by the IPCC AR4\r\nClimate Models: Credibility and Systematic Bias\r\n\r\nXiangdong Zhang\r\n\r\nInternational Arctic Research Center\r\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775\r\n\r\nArctic sea ice is a contributing and responding component to global climate change, which impact global energy balance and may amplify global warming signal.

While the interannual variations of the monsoon are well documented, the East Asian monsoon also  shows large interdecadal variations during the last 50 years or so, and this longer-term variability is poorly understood. Here we analyze the outputs of the 20th century climate simulations (20C3M) by 23 coupled climate models involved in IPCC AR4 to evaluate the performance of the latest generation of climate models in simulating the present climate over East Asia, and to address the question of whether the prescribed external forcing agents have played key roles in producing the interdecadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The results show that only models employing a high resolution AGCM component have reasonable performances in producing the main monsoon circulations such as the East Asian westerly jet, the western Pacific subtropical high and the low level monsoon circulations. The decadal variations of the EASM in ten models have significant correlations with observations during 1880-1999. For the recent half century (1950-1999), the EASM indices of nine models are significantly correlated with the observations at time scales longer than 10 years. These nine models include the CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, GISS-AOM,  GISS-ER, INM-CM3.0, IPSL-CM4, UKMO-HadGEM1. Starting from late 1970s, the EASM has experienced a strong weakening trend in observations, which resulted in less rainfall along the mid-lower Yellow River valley and excessive rainfall along the Yangtze River valley. This anomalous rainfall pattern is usually referred to as the Southern  Flooding and Northern Drought (SFND). Our analyses show that only a small number of models, namely the GFDL-CM2.1, IPSL-CM4, and HadCM3, have successfully produced this  weakening trend of the EASM. Furthermore, the weakening trend of the EASM in GFDL-CM2.1 is shown to be a forced-signal rather than model internal variability.

The weaker convection also keeps the marine boundary layer more moist, decreasing the excessively large latent heat flux, which has been shown to be responsible for too cold SSTs in the AOGCM.

In climate simulations, it is difficult to identify the primary model deficiencies responsible for such shortcomings, since their effects tend to be masked by nonlinear interactions of multiple processes and the resulting compensation of errors.\r\n \r\nTo address this issue, the USDOE-sponsored project known as CAPT (Climate Change Prediction Program-Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Parameterization Testbed) has developed a protocol for running a climate model in weather-forecast mode.

Analyzing these forecast errors may permit more direct identification of model deficiencies.

This paper examines dynamics of diurnal variations of rainfall and its systematic errors in models during the summer rainy season.\r\n\r\nDiurnal patterns of rainfall over the Indochina Peninsula were investigated, using in situ and satellite observations. A strong afternoon/evening maximum of rainfall prevails along the mountain ranges. Over the offshore of the Indochina Peninsula, mid-night/early-morning maximum of rainfall is observed.

When there is no large-scale disturbance, the some known aspects of diurnal patterns of rainfall can be simulated. Simulated mid-night maximum of rainfall over the Khorat Highland is consistent with the climatological diurnal patterns of rainfall.

The dependence of surface albedo on SZA is related to diurnal cycle and, therefore, is important for accurate simulation of surface energy and hydrological cycles. Most models account for the SZA dependence of ocean surface albedo (e.g., the two GFDL models, the three GISS models, INM CM3.0, IPSL-CM4, the two MIROC3.2 models, MRI-CGCM2.3.2, UKMO-HadCM3), but only a few models explicitly include the effect of SZA on land surface albedo (e.g., the two MIRCOC3.2 models, MRI-CGCM2.3.2). The NARR reanalysis and ECMWF schemes also does not include the dependence of land albedo on SZA.

But like all current CGCMs run without flux adjustments, the GFDL models retain substantial biases in their simulated tropical climate and variability. GFDL has taken three new avenues to meet these challenges. First, intercomparisons with our peer models in the IPCC AR4 archive, which are clarifying key sensitivities -- such as ENSO\\\'s sensitivity to the spatial structure of the wind stress response to SST anomalies.  The second avenue is a suite of automated diagnostics -- including climatological comparisons with multiple observational products, ENSO regressions to measure air-sea coupling and heat flux damping, correlations with local SSTs to gauge local feedbacks, and wavelet diagnostics to evaluate model spectra -- that provide helpful summary metrics for rapid assessment of coupled and uncoupled simulations.\r\n\r\nThe third approach is a hybrid coupled model framework -- consisting of the CGCM ocean component coupled to a statistical atmosphere that has been fit to a long run of the CGCM -- which provides an efficient and controllable testbed for isolating coupled sensitivities, intercomparing CGCMs, evaluating new oceanic and atmospheric components, and exploring how climatological biases affect model variability.  Together, these three avenues are establishing clear links among CGCMs, intermediate models, and ENSO theory, advancing our understanding of tropical climate and variability and ultimately helping to improve the models used to simulate and predict them.\r\n','2007-02-07 11:39:06'),(139,'Scinocca','John','','Resolved and Parameterized Waves in Climate Models','','L','','The impact of waves, both resolved and parameterized, on the general circulation of the atmosphere is essential to credibly model the climate system.  The importance of parameterized orographic gravity-wave drag (GWD) to the tropospheric winds, temperatures, and mass distribution is now well appreciated.  The upward extension of atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) into the stratosphere and mesosphere requires the additional parameterization of non-ororgraphic GWD.  Even so, orographic GWD appears to play a pivotal role in modelling stratospheric wind and temperature distributions that support chemical climate modelling.\r\n\r\nResolved tropical waves in GCMs are essential to the intraseasonal oscillation of the troposphere and the quasi biennial and semi-annual oscillations of the stratosphere and mesosphere.  Observations suggest that these waves are primarily forced by deep latent heating associated with tropical deep convection.  In GCMs, however, recent analysis has revealed that tropical deep latent heating arises from a competition between parameterized deep convection and spurious behaviour of the resolved stratiform precipitation.  Depending on the parameters employed for the deep convection, this artificial behaviour of the stratiform precipitation can dominate the mean and variance of tropical deep latent heating and so provide the primary source of resolved waves.\r\n\r\nThis spurious behaviour of the stratiform precipitation was first identified in the mesoscale modelling community where it was found to be associated with the phenomenon of grid-point storms.  In similar fashion such grid-point vortices of intense precipitation are found in GCM simulations when the stratiform precipitation dominates the tropical deep latent heating.  In addition to wave phenomena, it is demonstrated that modelled ENSO and analyses of extreme precipitation events are highly sensitive to this problem.','2007-02-07 11:41:38'),(141,'Tebaldi','Claudia','','Combining Multimodel Ensembles -- Coupling Statistics and Expert Judgment','','L','','With the increasingly easier access to increasingly larger experimental datasets from multi-model and single-model ensembles, a compelling need arises to develop statistical models in order to rigorously tease out the information these ensembles contain, both in terms of signals and uncertainty bounds.

Cronin\r\nNOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory\r\n\r\n\r\nData from the Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Studies (EPIC) mooring array are used to evaluate the annual cycle of surface cloud forcing and surface air-sea heat fluxes in the far eastern Pacific stratus cloud deck/cold tongue/intertropical convergence zone complex. Surface cloud forcing is defined as the observed downwelling radiation at the surface minus the clear-sky value. The relative amount of solar radiation reduction and longwave increase depends upon cloud type and varies with latitude. A statistical relationship between solar and longwave surface cloud forcing is developed for rainy and dry periods and for the mean annual cycle in six latitudinal regions: northeast tropical warm pool, ITCZ, frontal zone, cold tongue, southern, and stratus deck regions. While International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) radiative flux data (FD) compares well with the buoy cloud forcing observations and empirical relations, the NCEP Reanalysis 2 (NCEP2) and 40-year ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) show large discrepancies. In particular, NCEP cloud forcing at the equator was nearly identical to the ITCZ region and thus had significantly larger solar cloud forcing and smaller longwave cloud forcing than observed.  The net result of the solar and longwave cloud forcing deviations is that there is too little radiative warming in the ITCZ and southward to 8ï‚°S during the warm season and too much radiative warming under the stratus deck at 20ï‚°S and northward to the equator during the cold season. All reanalyses (including to a certain extent NCEP Reanalysis 1) appear to have a latent heat loss that is too large in the convective regions. NCEP1 has too weak latent heat loss throughout the stratocumulus region at and south of the equator during the cool season. The net effect is that NCEP2 and to a lesser extent ERA40, has large negative net surface heat flux (that is surface heat loss) biases relative to the buoy values. NCEP1 net surface heat flux errors are dominated by the radiative biases and result in anomalous net surface heat loss in the ITCZ and during the warm season at and south of the equator, and anomalous net surface heat gain at and south of the equator during the cold season when the stratus deck tends to form.\r\n\r\nThe ten EPIC TAO moorings along 95ï‚°W and the IMET mooring at 20ï‚°S 85ï‚°W are part of the network of global time series reference sites.

The 20th century from a subset of the IPCC AR4 simulations is analysed, by considering both atmospheric and oceanic fields. The purpose of this multi-model inter-comparison is to highlight the main biases affecting the mean seasonal variability in last generation climate models which are currently used to simulate climate scenarios and predict tropical variability and global teleconnections. In addition to a more traditional approach, we define several error indices, quantifying model biases (e.g., the double ITCZ), and try to relate them to the model ability in reproducing specific processes, such as, among the others, the monsoon and tropical/extra-tropical teleconnections. The role played by different parameterizations and horizontal/ vertical resolution on the mean seasonal cycle, is also analysed within the selected multi-model framework.\r\n\r\nResults indicate that a proper simulation of tropical seasonal cycle is still far from being reached due to the presence of spurious double-ITCZ, anomalously westward extended cold tongue and missing upwelling in the eastern tropical Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-01-26 16:05:07'),(149,'Sperber','Ken','H.

Here we analyze the BSISV in the CMIP3 and select CMIP2+ coupled ocean-atmosphere models. Difficulty remains in simulating the life-cycle of the BSISV, including the tilted rainband that is associated with the Rossby wave response to the eastward propagating equatorial convective anomalies (Annamalai and Sperber 2005). The ECHAM4/OPYC climate model, which is known to realistically represent the boreal winter MJO (Sperber et al. 2005), gives the most realistic simulation of the BSISV tilted rainband that is predicated on capturing the eastward equatorial propagation. This model also captures the initiation of the BSISV convection over the tropical western Indian Ocean that occurs in the presence of low-level easterly anomalies that are associated with the suppressed phase of the BSISV to the east, and the transition to low-level moisture convergence during the mature phase. The eastward propagation of convection and its relationship to sea-surface temperature, surface fluxes, and low-level moisture convergence is nearly identical to that of the boreal winter MJO. Northward propagation of convective anomalies are also preceded by low-level moisture convergence, though only in the vicinity of India. The extent of the northward propagation is related to the easterly wind shear (Lau and Peng 1990, Wang and Xie 1997, Annamalai and Sperber 2005). In the ECHAM4/OPYC model the simulated easterly shear does not extend as far north as observed, consistent with a dry bias in the monsoon rainfall climatology. The model also captures the interactive nature of the monsoon system including the link between the enhanced west Pacific rainfall and the onset of monsoon break over India.\r\n\r\nExtreme caution is needed when using metrics, such as the pattern correlation, for assessing the fidelity of model performance, as models with the most physically realistic BSISV do not exhibit the highest pattern correlations with observations.','2007-01-11 16:43:15'),(150,'AchutaRao','Krishna','','Ocean Heat Content Variability in the Second Half of the 20th Century: Results from the IPCC AR4 Simulations','','L','','Ocean Heat Content Variability in the Second Half of the 20th Century: Results from the IPCC AR4 Simulations\r\n\r\nAUTHORS: Krishna AchutaRao, Benjamin Santer, Peter Gleckler, Karl Taylor, Masayoshi Ishii, Tim Barnett, Jonathan M.

Using control integrations, we compare the simulation of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and its extratropical impact, in models developed for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report with models developed in the late 1990s [the so-called Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-2 (CMIP2) models]. The IPCC models tend to be more realistic in representing the frequency with which ENSO occurs, and they are better at locating enhanced temperature variability over the eastern Pacific Ocean. When compared with reanalyses, the IPCC models have larger pattern correlations of tropical surface air temperature than do the CMIP2 models during the boreal winter peak phase of El NinËœ o. However, for sea-level pressure and precipitation rate anomalies, a clear separation in performance between the two vintages of models is not as apparent. The strongest improvement occurs for the modeling groups whose CMIP2 model tended to have the lowest pattern correlations with observations. This has been checked by subsampling the multi-century IPCC simulations in a manner to be consistent with the single 80-year time segment available from CMIP2. Our results suggest that multi-century integrations may be required to statistically assess model improvement of ENSO. The quality of the El Nino precipitation composite is directly related to the fidelity of the boreal winter precipitation climatology, highlighting the importance of reducing systematic model error. Over North America distinct improvement of El Nino forced boreal winter surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and precipitation rate anomalies to occur in the IPCC models. This improvement is directly proportional to the skill of the tropical El Nino forced precipitation anomalies.\r\n\r\n','2007-02-07 11:50:42'),(152,'Smith','Leonard','','Relating the Diversity in Our Models to the Uncertainty in Our Future','','I','','Relating the Diversity in Our Models to the Uncertainty in Our Future\r\n\r\nLeonard A Smith\r\n\r\nToday\\\'s state-of-the-art climate models consist of complicated computer simulation models of the Earth\\\'s climate system.

The importance of simulating the ocean as accurately as possible in climate studies results from its role in storing and transporting heat, energy, freshwater, nutrients, and dissolved gases such as CO2.The ocean acts as a heat capacitor in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system and hence acts as an integrator of climate variability, introducing long time scales and slowing the rate of response to climate change forcing.

Furthermore, there is, at present, little practical justification for reducing our evaluation of model performance to a single number.  As an alternative, we urge the diagnostic community to join PCMDI in developing a wide variety of metrics useful in evaluating different aspects of model performance.   As our understanding of the relationship between skill in simulating present climate and predictive skill improves, the metrics arising from this process might serve as the ingredients for a number of different \\\"performance indices,\\\"  each one suitable for a specific application.\r\n','2007-02-07 11:58:06'),(162,'Horton','Radley','Cynthia Rosenzweig, and David C.

Major\r\n\r\nWe are using output from five AR4 CGCMs run with three SRES emissions scenarios to generate probabilistic climate change scenarios for the New York City watershed region.  As a first step, results from the climate of the 20th Century, as well as downscaled results with the NCAR MM5 RCM, are compared to observed gridded precipitation and temperature data (New et al. 1999) from 1970 to 1999.  At the annual scale, the multi-model ensemble results are within 1 C of observed temperature and 5 percent of observed precipitation, although individual model results are mixed.  At finer temporal scales, additional model biases are evident, including: 1) insufficient temporal variability at daily timescales, and 2) a cold bias during winter.  The monthly RMSE results over the region indicate that among the models selected, NCAR CCSM 3.0 and GFDL 2.1 show the most skill.  Our results suggest that hindcast runs with these CGCMs are of sufficient accuracy to justify their inclusion as key components in regional climate change scenarios.

To be used extensively by the research community, we  believe that this infrastructure will expedite science and provide a  collaborative environment to advance research in a way that can only  be done by this proposed framework. This framework is based on some  components used in the current SciDAC 1 ESG-II (which delivered data  that were the basis for some 200 journal articles in the past two  years); but it will be redesigned to fit a grander and more  distributed up-scaled vision that will encompass much more of the  user community. To aid in fulfilling our analysis requirements, we  have established collaborations with several SciDAC or other outside  projects. Many of these collaborations will rely solely on us to  deliver their diverse tools and products (e.g., analysis,  visualization, knowledge discovery tools, etc.) to the research  community. By enhancing our connections with these proposed SciDAC  efforts and by continuing to align ourselves with the climate  research community, we will address specific scientific needs  relating to data management and analysis over the next five years. As  a representative sample of these scientific needs, we will focus on  requirements generated by the next IPCC assessment, the CCSM and its  related SciDAC activities, and the Climate Science Computational End  Station. These three projects are well aligned with the rest of the  climate community and will provide a focus for ESG-CET efforts and  future development. More precisely, our projectâ€™s objectives are to: Connect a large number of outside researchers with geographically  distributed large climate model archives through client-server  infrastructure using middleware components, Provide scientists with easy-to-use advance data analysis tools for  their science and research, and Encourage and promote ESG-CET by enabling the community to contribute  to objectives 1 and 2, as well as their integration.
