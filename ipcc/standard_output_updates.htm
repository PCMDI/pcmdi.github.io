<p align="center"><b><font size="4">History of Changes Made to IPCC Standard 
Output</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>16 October 2007:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Corrected notes for entry 44 in table A1a (clivi) to indicate that
 only the solid-phase water (not the liquid or vapor)should be considered in 
calculating the atmosphere cloud ice content. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>15 September 2005:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added accommodation for the hybrid height coordinate, which 
appears in the Hadley Centre models.&nbsp; Also included depth coordinate for 
ocean fields, which had been previously inadvertently omitted.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>7 December 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added the following clarification for the 
global_average_thermosteric_sea_level_change: &quot;<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In 
a rigid-lid model this quantity can be calculated by using a reference 3D 
salinity field to compute density as the 3D temperature field evolves.&quot;</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Added a 
recommendation that daily mean data be computed for intervals beginning at 
midnight, i.e., 0 Z (UTC), and ending the following midnight at 0 Z.</span></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>22 November 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Replace occurrences of zostogm with zostoga and zosgm with zosga.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>17 November 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Clarified how zos should be computed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added zostoga and zosga to list of high priority output 
variables (Table 
O1c).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added to Table O1d the &quot;qflux&quot; as a high priority 
field for slab ocean experiments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added monthly-mean tasmin and tasmax to Table A1f.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">For mrfso, indicated explicitly in the comment column that it 
was frozen water only that should be considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Expanded descriptions of clwvi and clivi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Indicated that ISSCP simulator output should be generated from 
data sampled no less frequently than every 15 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Noted that htovgyre and htovovrt should exlcude 'bolus velocity' 
contributions from the Gent-McWilliams parameterization; further noted that 
htovdiff and
hfogo should include any 'bolus velocity' contribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Specified that in calculating wfo, zos, and zobt, only the ocean portion of 
each grid cell should be considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Changed 'atmospheric_boundary_layer_thickness' to 'atmosphere_boundary_layer_thickness'.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">We now request that in identifying forcing agents (table A5) the 
term that is &quot;most specific&quot;, not &quot;most general&quot; should be used (e.g., if the only anthropogenic effect included in the 
model simulation is an increase in carbon dioxide, use &quot;co2&quot;, not &quot;a&quot; or &quot;g&quot;).&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Corrected the cell_methods attribute associated with the 
time-dimension for daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>30 September 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Corrected length of first ensemble member requested for the 550 
ppm stabilization experiment (SRES B1): changed last year from 2200 to 2300.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added 20 year interval to the daily data requested for each of 
the 1%/yr CO2 experiments: 20 years centered on time of doubling for doubling 
experiment. and 20 years centered on time of quadrupling for the quadrupling 
experiment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Included a table of contents with links to sections of the 
document.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>15 September 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Noted that 3-hourly precipitation data should be averaged over 
the intervals 0-3Z, 3-6Z, ... 21-24Z, whereas the &quot;snapshots&quot; should be sampled 
at 0, 3, 6, ... 21Z.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Noted that stfmmc should exclude 'bolus velocity' contribution 
from the Gent-McWilliams parameterization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Clarified that all time intervals in the last table of experiments should 
  be interpreted as extending from the beginning of the first year indicated 
  through the end of the last year indicated.&nbsp; For example, years 1961-2000 
  means 0Z 1-1-2000 through 0Z 1-1-2001.</li>
  <li>Added a row to the coordinate dimension table for 'time1' which is needed 
  in the 3-hourly table (A3) to define the time axis for &quot;snapshot&quot; (rather than 
  time-mean) data (i.e., all but the precipitation field in this table).</li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>3 September 2004:</b></p>
<p align="left">Revised web links to be consistent with new PCMDI web site.</p>
<p align="left"><b>25 August 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Clarified in the last table that yearly data (i.e., extreme 
indices) should be submitted for the same years as the monthly data.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>2 August 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Changed period for which 3-hourly data should be reported in the 
&quot;pre-industrial control experiment&quot; from &quot;last year&quot; to &quot;last year of reported 
daily data (i.e., corresponding to year 2000 of the 20C3M expt.)&quot;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Modified description of a few fields to make them clearer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>20 July 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Changed years requested for the committed climate change 
experiment from tables A2a,b to be consistent with other experiments (i.e., 
2046-2065, not 2031-2050).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>19 July 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Changed one of the experiment names in the last table of the 
document: 'climate of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (20C3M)' was changed to 
'climate of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century experiment (20C3M)'.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>14 July 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p align="left">Added table of experiments and years of requested data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Moved dimension table to near the end of the document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Noted that &quot;flux-correction&quot; fields need to be reported only for 
a single year, assuming it applies to all experiments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Noted that disk space constraints will likely limit quick access 
to monthly-mean 3-d ocean output to a single member of each ensemble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Noted that daily data should only be reported for a single 
member of each ensemble, except for the surface air temperature (mean, max. and 
min.) and precipitation, which should be reported for all members.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><b>5 July 2004:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>The requested fields listed under&nbsp; 
  &quot;Highest priority output fields&quot; were not changed, but some of the 
  information given there was modified.</li>
  <li>The &quot;PCMDI names&quot; are now identified as &quot;output variable names&quot;, because 
  these are the variable names that should appear in the netCDF files.&nbsp; 
  These also serve as unique reference names for CMOR.&nbsp; Several names were 
  changed in this version to make them consistent with the existing CMIP data 
  base: ssh ==&gt; zos, sst ==&gt; tos, siu==&gt;usi, siv==&gt;vsi, prme==&gt;wfo, sftbaro==&gt;stfbarot, 
  topot==&gt;thetao, and rhopot==&gt;rhopoto</li>
  <li>The following units were changed:&nbsp; for ocean meridional overturning 
  stream function, kg<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp; ==&gt; m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; s<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; 
  for ocean barotropic stream function, kg<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp; ==&gt; m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; s<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; For several variables, percent ==&gt; % (nb. CMOR will accept &quot;percent&quot; as an 
  alias for &quot;%&quot;, but the netCDF file will show &quot;%&quot;).</li>
  <li>A few corrections were made to the &quot;standard_names&quot;</li>
  <li>The &quot;source&quot; column in the tables was replaced by a &quot;notes&quot; column 
  providing explanatory information.&nbsp; These notes should be studied 
  carefully to ensure conformance with IPCC requirements.</li>
  <li>Dimensionless units are now expressed simply as a numeric factor (e.g.,&nbsp; 
  '1' or '1e-3') or as '%', but not as a dimensionless ratio (e.g.,&nbsp; 
  'kg/kg').</li>
  <li>Tables were constructed and detailed information was provided (for the 
  first time) for the &quot;Lower priority fields&quot; (previously identified as 
  &quot;optional&quot;)..</li>
  <li>The following lower priority fields were eliminated: sea surface salinity 
  (already collected as part of the 3-d salinity field), the vertical and 
  horizontal components of temperature and salinity fluxes as a function of 
  longitude, latitude, model layer, and month (this was the only field requested 
  on model levels and is difficult to treat uniformly; interpolating to depth 
  levels would make it impossible to treat precisely and might not be any better 
  an approximation than multiplying velocity times salinity or temperature, 
  which is possible from fields collected as high priority), temperature on all sea 
  ice model levels (too difficult to uniformly treat sea ice models with 
  different vertical coordinates, and although this field would be useful for 
  energy budget studies, other terms in the budget are not being collected), 
  surface snow thickness (already collected as high priority field),&nbsp; &quot;tendency of sea ice thickness due to thermodynamics&quot; 
  (of little value without all the other terms needed to balance the sea ice 
  equation), and certain land surface fields, including total 
  heat storage, albedo, soil types, vegetation fraction etc (difficult to 
  define uniformly across models).</li>
  <li>A table with dimension information was added.</li>
