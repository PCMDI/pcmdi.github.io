The simulation of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation has been the subject of numerous
intercomparison studies over the last decade. Given that it is the dominant mode of
variability on time scales of 2-7 years, this is a mode of ocean/atmosphere
variability that is important to represent in coupled models. The study of
AchutaRao and Sperber (2002, Climate Dynamics, 19, 191-209) provided a standard
methodology for analyzing the space-time variability of ENSO in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project 2 (CMIP 2) models. While difficulties remain in the
simulation of ENSO (e.g., amplitude, seasonality, and periodicity), our subsequent
analysis of revised models from CMIP 2+ indicates that improvement in the
simulation of ENSO has been realized through model development (AchutaRao et al.
2004, An Appraisal of Coupled Climate Models, PCMDI Technical Report,
UCRL-TR-202550). These studies will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the
performance of the IPCC simulations.

In the control simulations the variance of sea surface temperature (SST) in the key
"NINO" regions will be analyzed, and spectral analysis will be used to determine
how well the models represent the broadband timescale observed. The relationship
between the NINO SST indices and the Southern Oscillation Index will be explored,
and used for compositing EL Nino/La Nina events to determine how well the models
represent the space-time structure of ENSO. The climate change simulations will be
analyzed to ascertain if anthropogenically forced changes to ENSO occur. Time
permitting, extratropical teleconnections of ENSO in the control and perturbed runs
will investigated, with emphasis on the response over North America. The ensembles
will used to assess the robustness of the response, though with 4 members it may be
necessary to use a multi-model approach.
