The UN (1992) projects that world population will under the most
likely scenario have increased from the 5.3 billion of 1990 to 6.3
billion by 2000, growing thereafter to 8.5 billion in 2025, 10.0
billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100. The World Bank's projection
is very similar. Nearly all of this growth is anticipated to occur in
today's developing countries. Increased world population would mean
increased global demand for energy, which with current energy
technologies would result in increased greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.

Nigeria is by far the largest country in Africa and ranks among the
fifteen largest nations in the world in terms of human population.
Among the major oil exporting countries, only Indonesia exceeds it in
size. Here in Nigeria, oil refineries are still being associated with
gas flaring, especially in the Niger Delta regions. This has been known
to create a favourable condition for the development of urban heat
islands. The United Nations estimates that the population of Nigeria
was about 106 million in 1998 and will reach approximately 244 million
in 2050. Such a growth in population, including that of the whole
country, will call for an increase in the supply of basic needs such
as food, energy, shelter, and clean air and water. With the growing
population of the inner cities in Nigeria, and the inability to
control rural-urban migration, there is a great strain on the
infrastructures of these cities.

Trend analysis and sectional emissions from our findings
show that fossils fuels contribute more than 90 percent to the
emission of SO2, CO2, Nox and Pb, about 70 percent for N2O and below
20 percent for NMVOC. CH4, CO and P.M. Other important sources for
emissions include biomass fuels, industries, biogenic process,
agriculture and municipal wastes (Obioh, 1995). In Nigeria, a national
inventory of CFC sources and CO2 gas from energy use as well as
methane from gas flares has been made. It is now estimated that 2,200
million cubic feet per
day of associated gas is flared in Nigeria, making the country the
largest gas flaring nation in the world. Gas flared in Nigeria also
contributes as much as 0.2 percent of global carbon dioxide production and
0.1 percent of global greenhouse forcing. Remedial action has
commenced by the initiation of a gas utilization project in Escravos
which will reduce gas flaring initially by 150 cubic million feet per
day equivalent to 1.5 BCM per year and later encourage additional gas
flaring utilization projects. We have shown that
contrary to widely held notions, air pollution in Nigerian cities have
reached significant levels and therefore there is a need to start
taking the necessary measures for its control and management,
especially through controls in population growth, consumption pattern
and reduced emissions of GHG.
