<p>
We are interested in analyzing regional aspects of climate change over the 
US as part of the AR4 GCM analysis project.
I'm especially interested in evaluating 
changes to the North American monsoon as a followup to our work analyzing 
the monsoon in HadCM2.  In order to do this we will need data at daily or 
sub-daily intervals.   
<p>
Is there a listing of which models expect to have data archived at daily or 
finer time resolution?  The "IPCC standard output" web page at 
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip/standard_output.html specifies daily-average 
output for some surface and radiation variables, but we would like to know 
if some of the models expect to have 3D state variables available at high 
time resolution.
