Cloud radiative feedbacks are likely to explain part of the climate
sensitivity spread among climate models. This project aims at evaluating
and better understanding the behaviour of clouds simulated by the
different coupled models participating to the IPCC AR4. The focus will be
put on tropical regions. This project has two main objectives:
<ol>
<li>To analyze and to evaluate against observations the behaviour of
tropical clouds simulated by the models on interannual to decadal
timescales during the 20th century.
Emphasis will be put on:
<ul>
<li>the presence of trends
<li>the sensitivity of clouds and cloud radiative forcing to changes in sea 
surface temperature.
</ul>

<li>To analyze the changes in cloudiness and in cloud radiative forcing
simulated by the models in climate change scenarios.
Emphasis will be put on:
<ul>
<li>the relationship, for each individual model, between the behaviour of 
  clouds simulated in the current climate and in a global climate change.
<li>the influence of large-scale circulation changes.
<li>the relationship between cloud changes and climate sensitivity.
</ul>
</ol>

<i>Methodology</i>:
composites of cloud properties within large-scale circulation regimes of
the Tropics (Bony S, J-L Dufresne, H Le Treut, J-J Morcrette and C Senior,
2004: "On dynamic and thermodynamic components of cloud changes", Climate
Dynamics, 22, 71-86).
<p>
<i>Time series of monthly-means needed (those with * are necessary for that 
subproject)</i>:
<ul>
<li> *sea surface temperature
<li> *500hPa large-scale vertical velocity
<li> *LW and SW radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (clear-sky and 
   total conditions) or LW and SW cloud radiative forcing
<li> *total cloud amount
<li> low, middle and high-level cloud amount
<li> precipitation
<li> cloud optical thickness or cloud water path
</ul>

<i>Coupled models simulations analyzed in priority</i>:
<ul>
<li> 20th century simulation to year 2000.
<li> 1% CO2 run to doubling or quadrupling of CO2.
</ul>
