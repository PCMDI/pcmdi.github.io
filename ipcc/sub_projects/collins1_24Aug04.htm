The radiative effect of well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) is probably the 
most significant anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. The most 
comprehensive tools for simulating past and future climates influenced by 
WMGHGs are fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs). 
Because of the importance of WMGHGs as forcing agents, it is essential that 
GCMs compute the radiative forcing by these gases as accurately as possible. 
We present the results of an intercomparison between the forcings computed by 
GCMs and by benchmark line-by-line (LBL) radiative transfer codes. The 
comparison is focused on forcing by CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, and the 
increased H2O expected in warmer climates. The models participating in the 
intercomparison include representatives from many of the modeling groups 
participating in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4) and from a number of 
the principal groups developing LBL codes.  The results indicate that there 
are still substantial discrepancies between GCMs and LBL models for forcings 
by CH4, N2O, and CO2. We quantify these differences and discuss the 
implications for interpreting variations in forcing and response across the 
multi-model ensemble of GCM simulations assembled for the IPCC AR4.
