<p>
A long standing problem with coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs is that
when the ocean and atmosphere are linked together, the simulated climate
can drift away from observations unless constrained by ad hoc adjustments
to air-sea fluxes ("flux adjustments").
In 2001
the 3rd Assessment Report of the IPCC noted that some modern coupled GCMs are
able to maintain stable runs without flux adjustments.
In the PCMDI's first appraisal of the state of the art of coupled GCMs, we
confirmed and elaborated this finding by examining output from the most
recent phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project.
We found that surface temperature trends are small compared with
observed trends, as expected for control run simulations in which
external climate forcing factors are held constant.
Deep ocean temperature and salinity trends are small enough
for model control runs to extend over 1000 years or more, but trends
in some regions, most notably the Arctic, are inconsistent among the
models and may be problematic. 
<p>
We plan to repeat this study using control run output from models
contributing to the 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC.
We require monthly means of surface temperature, 
3D ocean temperature and 3D ocean salinity.
We may also examine related fields such as ocean currents and air-sea fluxes
of water, energy and momentum.
Results for the IPCC 4AR models, when compared with the earlier
generation of models in the CMIP database, will allow assessment of
model improvements.
