Our recent work
has revealed stunning discrepancies among three global
reanalysis products (ERA40, NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE)
in their representations of the Hadley cell and the meridional
shallow circulation in the tropics. We think they are due to differences
in cloud parameterizations. It won't surprise us if similar
discrepancies also exist among the IPCC 4AR models. But it would be
also interesting to see how the deep and shallow meridional
circulations vary in different global warming
scenarios. This is what we plan to do:
<ol>
<li>Document global and regional zonal mean meridional
circulations (v and w) on y-z cross-sections (30N-30S).
<li>Document zonal and vertical (x-z) distribution of the
meridional wind along the equator to describe
the zonal variability of the meridional circulation.
<li>Document the associated distributions in temperature
and humidity, and vertical / meridional  transport of heat and
moisture by the deep and shallow circulations. (Are the
transports part of the standard model output?)
<li>Use indices measuring the strength of the deep and
shallow circulations and their heat / moisture transport
to monitor their time variability and to compare among
different models.
</ol>

Christos Mitas, a postdoc, will join us in this analysis.
