<p>
I have
just begun a DOE-funded project to look at the dynamics of Arctic
climate and circulation, and I would be grateful for the chance to 
expand the project to include the latest IPCC integrations.
<p>
The first priority of the proposed intercomparison is to look at the
annual cycle of the sea level pressure pattern over the Arctic and
sub-Arctic.  Motivation for the SLP comparison comes from Bitz et
al. (2002), who found that model biases in geostrophic surface
circulation have a profound effect on the distribution of Arctic sea
ice.  Holland and Bitz (in press at Climate Dynamics) further showed 
that sea ice biases in present-day climate simulations are linked to 
the extent of polar amplification in global warming simulations.
<p>
In addition to the SLP and surface circulation intercomparison, I plan
to use eddy temperature, geopotential height, potential vorticity, and
streamfunction to examine the three-dimensional structure of the flow
associated with the SLP centers, particularly the Beaufort High.  In
reanalysis, the Beaufort High is the surface expression of a deep
barotropic high rather than a surface-trapped feature associated with
cold lower-tropospheric temperatures.  Simulations of the high will be
more credible -- and less sensitive to local surface temperature
change -- if they can reproduce this deep vertical structure.
<p>
I also plan to look at the dynamical processes which maintain the
high-latitude circulation.  In particular, I would like to compare the
strength of the synoptic and submonthly fluxes of heat and momentum
among the models, and the strength of the diabatic heating.  In CCSM3
I have found that synoptic momentum flux is overestimated by a factor
of two or more, and I'm interested in the possibility that this is a
common AGCM bias.
<p>
Model data required: 
<ul>
<li>monthly-mean surface and 3-d circulation fields -- SLP, winds,
  temperature, geopotential height.

<li>sub-monthly eddy flux statistics (uu, uv, vv, vt, wt).

<li>total diabatic heating.

<li>6-hourly or once-daily horizontal winds and temperature at an upper
  level, winds and temperature at a lower level, and SLP.
</ul>
