<i>Seasonality and variability of large-scale forcing of eastern boundary
current regions in the 20th, 21st, and 22nd centuries</i>:
<p> 
Dr. Noah Diffenbaugh (Assistant Professor, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences)
will conduct the analyses at Purdue University. The subject of the analyses
will be the seasonality and annual- to decadal-scale variability of
large-scale forcing of eastern boundary current (EBC) regions. EBCs support
highly productive marine ecosystems, as well as large agricultural areas.
They are forced by both regional- and large-scale processes, including
annual to decadal modes such as ENSO and PDO. The objectives of the analysis
will be (1) to test the ability of the participating coupled GCMs to
reproduce observed records of 20th century seasonality and variability of
large-scale EBC forcing and (2) to evaluate those large-scale processes in
the SRES A1B and B2 scenarios. The analyses will use output from the 20th
century simulation (from either run 1 or run 6 on the WGCM run list) and the
SRES A1B and B1 simulations (from run 2 and run 3 on the WGCM run list).
Model data will come from the time-independent 2-d land surface and ocean
data, monthly-mean 1-d ocean data, monthly-mean 2-d atmosphere, land
surface, ocean and sea ice data, and monthly-mean 3-d atmosphere and ocean
data (Tables A1a, A1b, A1c, O1a, O1b, O1c, O1d, O1e). While it is of course
impossible to know all of the variables of potential interest prior to
conducting the analyses, variables of known interest include: psl, pr, tas,
mrso, uas, vas, clt (Table A1a), orog, sftlf (Table A1b), cl, ta, ua, va,
hus, wap, zg, hur (Table A1c), tos (Table O1c), zobt (Table O1d), so, uo,
vo, and wo (Table O1e). The minimum required variables are pr, ts, ta, ua,
va, zg, and wo.
