The proposed analysis addresses possible trends and variability that can be
detected in future climate simulations of tropical and intense extra-tropical
cyclone-like events over the east and south Indian Ocean, and also the Southern
Ocean in Australian/New Zealand longitudes.  These systems play a major role in
defining the regional climate of the area and also contribute significantly to the
larger-scale general circulation of the atmosphere, through their interaction with
the oceans.  They are highly destructive systems both over the ocean or when
approaching or making landfall. Changes in their frequency, intensity, duration and
tracks therefore are of great importance. So far, there have been few studies of
these systems.  However, as a reference for determining trends, the PI recently has
completed an extensive study, resulting in a co-authored article describing the
climatology developed from past and present climate data, up to 2003 (Buckley, BW
and LM Leslie, International J. of Climatology, 2004). The systems are identified
in climate simulations using signature parameters such as the magnitudes of 850 hPa
winds and vorticity fields, and SLP values of the surface centers relative to
specified thresholds.  The data required therefore is daily (or higher frequency if
available) mean values of surface and upper level winds and geopotential heights
(if available). Weekly SST fields are also desirable.
