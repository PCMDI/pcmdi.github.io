"Blocking" of the usual westerly flow in the mid-latitudes is a recurring
characteristic of the Australian/New Zealand region. Such blocking patterns often
bring drought and fire weather to some parts of the region and flood rains to other
parts, depending upon the type of blocking pattern.  The socio-economic impact of
extended blocking episodes is very great.  Therefore it is of vital importance to
assess future trends in the frequency, strength, location and duration of these
blocking events, particularly the more intense, longer-duration episodes.  The
authors have just completed an article on blocking over this region for the
fifty-year period 1955-2004, using the NCEP reanalysis data and it is in the review
process.  As part of the study we have developed a large and comprehensive
reference data set of blocking indices, related parameters, and impacts.  This data
set is an ideal reference from which to calculate trends present in the future
climate simulations.  The data required for the analysis is the daily means of the
SLP fields, the 500 hPa winds and geopotential heights, which form the ingredients
for computing the blocking indices favored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
