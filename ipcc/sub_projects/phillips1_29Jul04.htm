<p>
The goals of the subproject will be to
<ol>
<li>validate selected components of the global atmospheric and land-surface
hydrological cycles in the IPCC control runs, and 
<li>analyze perturbed-minus-control climate changes in these components and in
related hydrological diagnostics.  
</ol>
<p>
Because of the dearth of global observations of most hydrological components, we
will limit quantitative validation of the control climates mainly to precipitation
and precipitable water.  (For these components it is feasible to choose different
global reference data sets in order to bracket current observational
uncertainties.)  However, we also will qualitatively validate model climatologies
of runoff and land-surface evaporation using estimates derived from land models
that are driven off-line with observed forcings (e.g. as provided by the GLDAS
and/or GSWP projects).  To supplement this limited observational validation, we
will verify model conformance with relevant atmospheric and land moisture
conservation laws, and the absence of spurious trends in soil moisture and snow
mass.  In addition, we will analyze perturbed-minus-control climate changes in
diagnostics which are indicators of hydrological processes having important
societal ramifications (e.g. changes in atmospheric moisture residence time and
convergence-divergence patterns, in the timing of Spring snow melt and associated
runoff, in fractional soil wetness, in the partitioning of precipitation between
runoff and evapotranspiration, etc.) 
<p>
Other scientists conversant with any of these topics are welcome to participate.

Model data requirements: Monthly fields of global precipitation, precipitable
water, runoff, soil water and soil ice (if predicted) with associated field
capacities, snow mass/cover/melt, soil ice (if predicted), and land-surface
evapotranspiration or latent heat flux.
