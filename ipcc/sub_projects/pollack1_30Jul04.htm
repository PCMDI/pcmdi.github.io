My interest is in the computational quantities sometimes referred to as the
"ground surface temperature", "shallow soil temperature", and "deep soil
temperature". These are computed only for continental regions, and perhaps not
by all models. My interest stems from my extensive experience in analyzing
subsurface temperature records in terms of reconstructing past climate change.
Questions arise as to how strongly and faithfully subsurface temperatures and
air temperatures are coupled at decadal and centennial time scales. We have
substantial empirical data comprising both air and ground temperatures, and the
energy fluxes across the air-ground interface, to compare with climate model
output of these quantities. The relevance to the climate modeling community is
an assessment of how well various air-ground coupling schemes perform.
