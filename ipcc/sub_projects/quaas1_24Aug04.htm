<p>
During my PhD thesis at Laboratoire 
de Meterorologie Dynamique (LMD/IPSL) in Paris and afterwards as a 
post-doc at Max-Planck-Insitute for Meteorology in Hamburg, I've been 
interested in the analysis of aerosol indirect effects in GCMs.
I have been working with Olivier Boucher, Herve Le Treut, Jean-Louis 
Dufresne and others in France and with Johann Feichter and others in 
Germany, and will continue the collaborations for possible questions in 
the IPCC analyses.
<p>
My interest would be on the analysis of those of the models and 
simulations which include the aerosol indirect forcings.

<h3>Subject of the analysis</h3>
<p>
I would like to contribute to the analysis of the IPCC scenarios by
<ol>
<li>analysing statistically the strength of the aerosol indirect effects 
in the models.
<li>analysing the evolution of the aerosol impacts on different 
quantities by comparing simulations including and excluding 
anthropogenic aerosols.
</ol>

<h3>Objective of the analysis</h3>
<p>
For (1), the modelled aerosol indirect effects could be compared to 
similar relationships based on satellite data. This would give a 
qualitative estimate about how well the particular models simulate the 
aerosol indirect effects, and could help to distinguish models which 
perhaps over- or underestimate this forcing.
<p>
For (2), the modelled climate trends in surface temperature, diurnal 
temperature range, shortwave radiation, and cloud cover at the different 
altitudes could be intercompared, and for the 20th century also compared 
to observed tendencies. A qualitative assessment could be possible about 
how well the different trends are represented in the particular models.

<h3>Data required</h3>
<p>
I would need for (1), if available, a measure of the aerosol load in the 
models (e.g., aerosol optical depth), and a measure of the cloud 
particle size (e.g., cloud droplet effective radius). In addition, cloud 
optical thickness and/or cloud liquid water path would be helpful for 
further analysis. For (2), I would ask for measures of the surface 
temperature, diurnal temperature range (or equivalently daily maximum- 
and minimum temperatures), low level, mid level and high level 
cloudiness in the ISCCP definitions, total cloudiness, and radiative 
fluxes in the shortwave band at the top of the atmosphere and the surface.
