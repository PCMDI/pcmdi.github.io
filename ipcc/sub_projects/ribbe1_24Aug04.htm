<i>Subject and Objective of Analysis</i>: We would like to perform an analysis of the
warming that is anticipated to occur in the subsurface ocean of the southern
hemisphere. In particular, we will concentrate on the changes that may occur
in the intermediate and mode water range. These water bodies link the Southern
Ocean with the equatorial ocean and carry much of the anticipated global
warming signal into the interior of the ocean. Aim is to assess the future
impact of future global warming on subsurface ocean dynamics.
 
<p>
<i>Required ocean data</i>: u, v, w, T, S, rho, and surface fluxes.
