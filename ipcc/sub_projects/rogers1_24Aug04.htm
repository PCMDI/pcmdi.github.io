<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) on the variability and receipt of precipitation over
Europe.  We propose to investigate the 20th Century representation of
the NAO in the control run relative to observations, and during the
21st Century where model output for several scenarios will be
contrasted with the control run. From the 1970s until recently the
NAO trend has been upward and this has been accompanied by an
intensified mean Icelandic Low that is displaced unusually farther
northeast during the cold season in years with strong Atlantic
westerlies.  Little evidence of change appears to occur in negative
phase years.  The resulting NAO 20th century modes might be
characterized by normal positive and negative phases and a more recent
hyper-positive phase with centers displaced closer to Europe and
possibly forced by the Indian Ocean.  Evaluations of these
characteristics in the control run will be made and the potential role
of NAO phase and intensity changes in the future will be evaluated in
light of the hydroclimate of Europe.  Precipitation receipt and
associated data (e.g. cloudiness, precipitable water, u- and v-wind
components, runoff, and soil moisture) will be evaluated in similar
manner. The changing frequency of extreme precipitation events will
also be investigated on monthly and seasonal-mean timescales,
including evaluation of changes in intensity and frequency of drought.
The role of potential precipitation changes in the 21st century on
stream flow in alpine regions, especially southern Europe which is
particularly affected by wet negative-phase conditions, will be
evaluated.
