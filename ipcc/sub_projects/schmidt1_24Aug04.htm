I'm loosely involved with a number
of recently funded CMEP projects that are very specific (annular
modes, surface radiation budget, water mass formation rates, storm track
analysis etc.).
It is in the nature of
climate modelling to need to look at a wide selection of fields to pick
out things / processes of interest, and I feel that some amount of 'what
are the models trying to tell us'-type research is a useful adjunct to
the more specific 'how does the NAO vary in each model' kind of project.
People at the modelling centers are well-placed to do that since they
both have more experience with the models, and also access to more
specific diagnostics, not being archived at PCMDI, that may prove
enlightening.
<p>
Thus, I do not want to either commit myself to providing a specific
product by March, or restrict the scope of the analyses that we are
doing anyway.
<p>
As a group we want to be able to contribute to the discussion at the
workshop, and if interesting, have our analyses incorporated into the
assessment report. That means that we need to be able to access the
other model groups' output. I feel that allowing more access to this
data is more 'open' than the converse!
