<p>
We would like to continue  work on comparing the rates of oceanic heat uptake in
different AOGCMs, which started as CMIP Subproject #20. The objective of this study
is to estimate uncertainty in the heat uptake by the deep ocean among existing
coupled AOGCMs.
<p>
As shown in Sokolov et al. (2003), the MIT 2D climate model of intermediate
complexity can match the behaviors of different AOGCMs in transient climate change
simulation with the appropriate choice of two parameters, the model's climate
sensitivity and the effective diffusivity for ocean heat anomalies. Then values of
the effective diffusion coefficient provide quantitative estimates for ocean heat
uptake for different models. A detailed description of this approach is given in
Sokolov et al. (2003) together with the results based on the CMIP2 simulations.
Availability of the results of the transient simulations with different forcings
for each model will allow evaluation of the robustness of the estimates obtained.
<p>
Data required for this study are surface air temperature, heat fluxes at the
tropopause and at the surface and sea level change due to thermal expansion of the
ocean (or data from which it can be calculated).
<p> 
Analysis will be done by Andrei Sokolov, MIT Joint Program on Science and Policy of
Global Change.
