The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) dominates the convective signal over the
tropical Eastern Hemisphere, with teleconnections extending into the extratropics
due to the large-scale convective extent and duration of the MJO convective
anomalies. A methodology is utilized to analyze in a standardized fashion the MJO
in general circulation models. This is attained by projecting 20-100 day bandpass
filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the models onto the two leading
empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of observed OLR that characterize the
propagation of MJO convection from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific Ocean.
The resulting principal component time series are then screened to isolate boreal
winters during which they exhibit a lead-lag relationship consistent with
observations. This PC subset is used for linear regression to determine the ability
of the models to simulate the observed space-time variability of the MJO. Analysis
of control integrations of the CMIP2+ models indicates that the vast majority of
models underestimate the amplitude of the MJO convective anomalies by a factor of
two or more, and the eastward propagation of convection is less coherent than
observed, typically. For a given family of models, coupling to an ocean leads to
better organization of the large-scale convection. The low-level moisture
convergence mechanism for eastward propagation of the MJO is represented in limited
cases, as is the vertical structure of moisture and divergence. The analysis of the
CMIP2+ models provides a frame of reference for evaluating improvement in the
simulation of the MJO in the IPCC control simulations.

It is envisioned that the IPCC control runs will first be analyzed to determine the
models that give the most realistic representation of the MJO based on the
afore-mentioned diagnostics. With this subset of models the climate change
integrations will be analyzed to ascertain anthropogenically forced perturbations
to this important mode of variability. Previous work by Slingo et al. (1999, QJRMS,
125, 583-609) has demonstrated an increased amplitude of observed MJO variability
as the tropics warmed in the post-1976 regime transition compared to earlier
decades. This suggests that additional warming due to anthropogenic climate change
may strongly influence the MJO. During years when the MJO is active, the tendency
is for below-normal rainfall over Austral-Asia, mainly due to reduced convection
during the suppressed phase of the MJO. If the MJO becomes stronger in the future,
this may have dire consequences for the agricultural based economies of the
tropics.

<h3>Data Requirements</h3>
<p>
Daily mean 2-d atmosphere data (Table A2a):
psl, pr, tas, hfls, hfss, rsus, uas, vas, rlut.
<i>Note</i>:
In an apparent oversight, daily sea-surface temperature (SST) was not included in
the requested standard output. I feel strongly that SST should be added to the list
of daily output. This is a variable of great interest for MJO, being related to
surface wind and latent heat flux anomalies. The strength of the SST anomalies may
be important for modulating the eastward propagation of the MJO.

Daily mean 3-d atmosphere data (Table A2b):
ua, va, hu.
