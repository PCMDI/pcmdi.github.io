The simulation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) will be evaluated in control
and climate change simulations in anticipation of the IPCC Fourth Assessment
Report. The observed NAO is defined using monthly sea-level pressure anomalies over
the Atlantic sector from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis. Sea-level pressure from the
models is projected onto the observed modes to ensure that a standardized analysis
is performed by comparing to a common metric. The principal components obtained
from each of the models will be regressed against other variables, including but
not limited to sea-level pressure, surface air temperature, sea-surface
temperature, and precipitation to evaluate the space-time variability of the NAO in
the models. Additionally, the NAO influence on the extratropical storm tracks will
be investigated. The available climate change scenario runs will be analyzed to
assess anthropogenically forced perturbations to the NAO in space and time.
<p>
From a previous analysis of CMIP2+ control integrations we found that the North
Atlantic Oscillation was well represented (AchutaRao et al. 2004, An Appraisal of
Coupled Climate Models, PCMDI Technical Report, UCRL-TR-202550). The spatial
pattern of the large-scale surface air temperature response to the sea-level
pressure perturbation over the Atlantic is akin to that observed, with the spatial
error indicating the model response is not as strong as observed. This shortcoming
was systematic across the models analyzed, and it was suggested that improvement in
the extratropical flow will improve this aspect of the NAO response. Our previous
analysis of the CMIP2+ models provides a benchmark against which the new IPCC runs
can be compared to determine whether the simulation of the NAO has improved during
the course of model development.
