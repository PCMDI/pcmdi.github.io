Climate models are generally consistent in showing greater surface
warming over land than over the sea in response to greenhouse gas
forcing.  However, the ratio of land to sea warming varies by up to a
factor of 2 between different models.  The aim of this project is to
understand the factors that determine the ratio of warming over land
to warming over sea, and the dependence of this ratio on latitude,
in CMIP integrations.  The analysis will be conducted by Jonathan
Gregory and Rowan Sutton at the Centre for Global Atmospheric
Modelling at the University of Reading, UK.  The initial focus will be
on the 1% CO2 integrations and the equilibrium slab experiments. Data
required will include gridpoint values of a wide range of (primarily)
surface fields: surface temperatures and surface fluxes especially
and, where available, surface specific humidity, soil moisture, snow
depth etc.  Plus the land/sea mask!
