I would like to sign up to analyze some of the 20th century or future climate
simulations performed for the IPCC AR4. I am currently an assistant professor at
the University of Connecticut with expertise in biosphere-atmosphere interactions.
My research focuses on the role of dynamic vegetation in climate variability and
changes at the decadal to centennial time scales. I have used various models to
address this topic, and focused geographically in West Africa in the past. For the
IPCC AR4, I would like to carry out some analysis on the impact of vegetation
dynamics on decadal rainfall variability in the 20th century and on the projected
future rainfall changes. The analysis will be for the whole globe, but with
emphasis on several showcase regions. My objective is to improve our understanding
on the role of vegetation dynamics in regional and/or global hydrological cycles. I
will need at least two types of simulations of the past and/or the future climates:
one with vegetation specified, and one with vegetation simulated by the model. In
case a dynamic carbon cycle is included, additional model simulations will be
needed to separate the impact of the carbon cycle feedback and the dynamic
vegetation feedback. For the proposed analysis, I would like to look at all the
surface fluxes (e.g., latent heat, sensible heat, transpiration), surface albedo,
plant biomass, LAI, NPP, precipitation, surface skin and air temperatures, among
others.
