<p>
I am interested in analyzing the model outputs for
IPCC runs and would like to make a registration.
My analysis topics are:

<ol>
<li>trends and variability of cyclone activity in
   the North Hemisphere mid- and high-latitutes.
<li>trends and variability of Arctic sea ice and
   ocean properties.
</ol>

<p>
I welcome any suggestions and comments.
