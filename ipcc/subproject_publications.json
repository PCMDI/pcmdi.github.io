            "abstract": "A long standing problem with coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs is that when the ocean and atmosphere are linked together, the simulated climate can drift away from observations unless constrained by ad hoc adjustments to air-sea fluxes (\"flux adjustments\"). In 2001 the 3rd Assessment Report of the IPCC noted that some modern coupled GCMs are able to maintain stable runs without flux adjustments. In the PCMDI's first appraisal of the state of the art of coupled GCMs, we confirmed and elaborated this finding by examining output from the most recent phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We found that surface temperature trends are small compared with observed trends, as expected for control run simulations in which external climate forcing factors are held constant. Deep ocean temperature and salinity trends are small enough for model control runs to extend over 1000 years or more, but trends in some regions, most notably the Arctic, are inconsistent among the models and may be problematic.\n\nWe plan to repeat this study using control run output from models contributing to the 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC. We require monthly means of surface temperature, 3D ocean temperature and 3D ocean salinity. We may also examine related fields such as ocean currents and air-sea fluxes of water, energy and momentum. Results for the IPCC 4AR models, when compared with the earlier generation of models in the CMIP database, will allow assessment of\nmodel improvements.",

            "abstract": "We propose an investigation of a range of aspects of Australian climate, as projected by the models for the SRES A1B, B1 and A2 scenarios.\n\nInitially, we will compare the annual and monthly climate of a suite of models participating in the AR4 CMIP with those of observations and reanalyses. Emphasis will be the seasonal (monthly) variation across Australia of temperature, precipitation and surface pressure, to determine how well the observed climatologies, as well as their seasonal variations are captured by the models. \n\nA second component of the study will address the impact of climate change on temperature and precipitation in the Australian region as projected by the models. In particular, we are interested in evaluating the evolution of the Australian component of the Asian-Australian monsoon under climate change conditions. Depending upon time, other variables (e.g. cloud cover, soil moisture, winds) may also be considered, as available, in both current climate and under climate change.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Australian continent extends from the tropics to mid latitudes, and poses a particular challenge for climate models. The Australian tropics are strongly influenced by the surrounding oceans, and are subject to a strongly varying seasonal cycle of precipitation and surface pressure, dominated by the Australian component of the Asian-Australian monsoon (e.g. McBride, 1998). Total precipitation in northern Australia is strongly influenced by ENSO, showing marked interannual variability. Winter conditions in tropical Australia, on the other hand are subject to mild, and relatively dry, southeast trades.\n\nSouthern Australian regions are subject to eastward moving mid latitudes cyclones. The mean location of the cyclone belt varies seasonally from south of the continent in summer, to the southern portion of the continent in winter, with consequent seasonality of temperature and precipitation. Central parts of the continent are predominantly dry, with occasional precipitation episodes penetrating from the north and south. Other distinctive features contribute to mid continental precipitation, such as north-west cloud bands. Topography across the continent is generally low, although the eastern ranges have a significant impact on regional temperatures and precipitation.\n\nThese patterns of precipitation: monsoonal in the north, Mediterranean in the southwest, 'mid latitude' in the southeast, and dry in the centre are important features to capture in climate models. As part of the CMIP2 subproject 54, Moise et al. (manuscript in preparation) have reported a preliminary analysis of 18 CMIP2 models in their simulations of key surface climate and surface fluxes in the Australian region. Significant model deficiencies in their simulations of rainfall and surface temperature climatologies were identified.\n\nThe AR4 model comparison offers a unique opportunity to (a) examine how the latest versions of coupled models represent basic features such as pressure, temperature and precipitation in the current Australian region climate, including their seasonal and geographical variations, and (b) investigate projected climate change under standard scenarios. Time permitting, a further study of basic features of the Australian monsoon will also be considered. This is a necessary component in the ongoing efforts of projecting future climate changes in Australia using coupled climate models. The IPCC assessment of vulnerability report (Watson et al., 1998) noted particular concern for Australia for changes to the timing, intensity and location of tropical monsoon systems, and location and intensities of mid latitude weather systems and the subtropical anti cyclone belt. \n\nMethodology\n\nThe first stage of the study will involve a comparison of annual and monthly AR4/CMIP control simulations (20th century simulation or other \u2018control\u2019 simulations) with \u2018observed\u2019 values. \u2018Observational\u2019 data sets here include the Australian Bureau of Meteorology rainfall and temperature data sets, as well as ERA-40 and NCEP reanalyses. Comparisons will be of mean fields, as well as geographical patterns and seasonal changes of surface temperature, precipitation (including monsoon precipitation) and MSLP. \n\nThe second stage involves a comparison of patterns of future climate change projected by the AR4/CMIP models for the Australian region. This will consist of comparisons of the last 20 years of the control versus the SRES experiments, as well as comparisons of the full experiment time series.\n\nA later part of the project will consider interannual variability, in addition to the calculation of standard deviation from multi-year model integrations in measuring the interannual climate variations simulated by the models.\n\nTo further understand the role of ENSO in affecting Australian climate interannual variations, some simple statistics, such as the correlations of surface climate variables with Nino3.4 index, will be calculated from the AR4/CMIP runs.\n\nReferences\n\nMcBride, J., 1998: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and tropical Australia: the Southern Hemisphere monsoon.

(For these components it is feasible to choose different global reference data sets in order to bracket current observational uncertainties.)  However, we also will qualitatively validate model climatologies of runoff and land-surface evaporation using estimates derived from land models that are driven off-line with observed forcings (e.g. as provided by the GLDAS and/or GSWP projects).  To supplement this limited observational validation, we will verify model conformance with relevant atmospheric and land moisture conservation laws, and the absence of spurious trends in soil moisture and snow mass.  In addition, we will analyze perturbed-minus-control climate changes in diagnostics which are indicators of hydrological processes having important societal ramifications (e.g. changes in atmospheric moisture residence time and convergence-divergence patterns, in the timing of Spring snow melt and associated runoff, in fractional soil wetness, in the partitioning of precipitation between runoff and evapotranspiration, etc.) \n\nOther scientists conversant with any of these topics are welcome to participate.\n\nModel data requirements: \nMonthly fields of global precipitation, precipitable water, runoff, soil water and soil ice (if predicted) with associated field capacities, snow mass/cover/melt, soil ice (if predicted), and land-surface evapotranspiration or latent heat flux.",

            "abstract": "We expect that simulations of future climate change performed in preparation for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report will, as in the past, yield a range of predictions, with global mean equilibrium climate responses differing by perhaps a factor of two. Although the model predictions of climate change for a few decades from now will likely vary by a substantially smaller amount (because in transient climate change, ocean heat uptake tends to moderate differences in climate sensitivity), the reasons for differences in global climate sensitivity can shed light both on why models differ, and also on which feedbacks are largest and most important to get right. Thus, the uncertainty in future predictions of climate change can be better gauged if the feedbacks are better understood. We propose to analyze feedbacks in the climate models by focusing primarily on the idealized coupled model experiments involving 1% per year increases in CO2 and the slab ocean equilibrium experiment in which CO2 is doubled. These idealized experiments are the easiest to analyze because the CO2 radiative forcing scales logarithmically with concentration. If the modeling groups calculate clear-sky and all sky CO2 radiative forcing for a doubled concentration of CO2, we will be able to use methods for estimating feedbacks by monitoring the fluxes of radiation at the top of the atmosphere. We should be able to gauge the relative importance of shortwave and longwave cloud feedbacks (due to overall cloud fraction changes as well as changes in the combined effects of distribution and optical propoerties), surface albedo feedbacks (e.g., due to snow, sea ice, vegetation changes) and also the combined effects of water vapor and lapse rate. We expect to consider not only the global differences in feedbacks among the IPCC models, but also their spatial and perhaps seasonal differences. If modeling groups calculate the radiative forcing in the other scenario simulations, we will also analyze these using the same methods.",

            "abstract": "The simulation of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation has been the subject of numerous intercomparison studies over the last decade. Given that it is the dominant mode of variability on time scales of 2-7 years, this is a mode of ocean/atmosphere variability that is important to represent in coupled models. The study of AchutaRao and Sperber (2002, Climate Dynamics, 19, 191-209) provided a standard methodology for analyzing the space-time variability of ENSO in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 2 (CMIP 2) models. While difficulties remain in the simulation of ENSO (e.g., amplitude, seasonality, and periodicity), our subsequent analysis of revised models from CMIP 2+ indicates that improvement in the simulation of ENSO has been realized through model development (AchutaRao et al. 2004, An Appraisal of Coupled Climate Models, PCMDI Technical Report, UCRL-TR-202550). These studies will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the IPCC simulations.\n\nIn the control simulations the variance of sea surface temperature (SST) in the key \"NINO\" regions will be analyzed, and spectral analysis will be used to determine how well the models represent the broadband timescale observed. The relationship between the NINO SST indices and the Southern Oscillation Index will be explored, and used for compositing EL Nino/La Nina events to determine how well the model represent the space-time structure of ENSO. The climate change simulations will be analyzed to ascertain if anthropogenically forced changes to ENSO occur. Time permitting, extratropical teleconnections of ENSO in the control and perturbed runs will investigated, with emphasis on the response over North America. The ensembles will used to assess the robustness of the response, though with 4 members it may be necessary to use a multi-model approach.\n\nData Requirements:\n\nTable A1a: Monthly mean 2-d atmosphere or land surface data\npsl, pr, tas, tauu, tauv, hfls, hfss, ts, uas, vas, rlut\n\nTable A1c: Monthly mean 3d atmosphere data\nta, ua, va, zg\n\nTable O1c: Monthly mean 2-d ocean or sea-ice data\ntos\n\nTable O1d: Monthly mean 3-d ocean or sea-ice data\nthetao, uo, vo, wo",

            "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) dominates the convective signal over the tropical Eastern Hemisphere, with teleconnections extending into the extratropics due to the large-scale convective extent and duration of the MJO convective anomalies. A methodology is utilized to analyze in a standardized fashion the MJO in general circulation models. This is attained by projecting 20-100 day bandpass filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the models onto the two leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOF\u00d5s) of observed OLR that characterize the propagation of MJO convection from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific Ocean. The resulting principal component time series are then screened to isolate boreal winters during which they exhibit a lead-lag relationship consistent with observations. This PC subset is used for linear regression to determine the ability of the models to simulate the observed space-time variability of the MJO. Analysis of control integrations of the CMIP2+ models indicates that the vast majority of models underestimate the amplitude of the MJO convective anomalies by a factor of two or more, and the eastward propagation of convection is less coherent than observed, typically. For a given family of models, coupling to an ocean leads to better organization of the large-scale convection. The low-level moisture convergence mechanism for eastward propagation of the MJO is represented in limited cases, as is the vertical structure of moisture and divergence. The analysis of the CMIP2+ models provides a frame of reference for evaluating improvement in the simulation of the MJO in the IPCC control simulations.\n\nIt is envisioned that the IPCC control runs will first be analyzed to determine the models that give the most realistic representation of the MJO based on the afore-mentioned diagnostics. With this subset of models the climate change integrations will be analyzed to ascertain anthropogenically forced perturbations to this important mode of variability. Previous work by Slingo et al. (1999, QJRMS, 125, 583-609) has demonstrated an increased amplitude of observed MJO variability as the tropics warmed in the post-1976 regime transition compared to earlier decades. This suggests that additional warming due to anthropogenic climate change may strongly influence the MJO. During years when the MJO is active, the tendency is for below-normal rainfall over Austral-Asia, mainly due to reduced convection during the suppressed phase of the MJO. If the MJO becomes stronger in the future, this may have dire consequences for the agricultural based economies of the tropics.",

We have conducted a similar analysis of changes in \nsynoptic patterns near the North Slope of Alaska for the latter part \nof the 20th century, and feel that this analysis technique would \nprove useful in assessing future climate change scenarios and \nthe impacts of possible changes in the climate. The results of this \nanalysis will be the identification of the primary synoptic weather \npatterns (we will identify up to 30 synoptic weather patterns \nbased on sea-level pressure fields over pan-Arctic and a \npan-Antarctic analysis domains) for three time periods (1991-2000, \n2046-2055, and 2091-2100), and to determine changes in the \nfrequency of occurrence of the different synoptic weather patterns \nbased on the future climate predictions. A key result from the \nanalysis will be the identification and characterization of extreme \ncyclones as they are represented in the models and in contemporary \nanalyses. This work will be completed by the Polar Climate and \nMeteorology Group at the University of Colorado, led by John \nCassano, and by Amanda Lynch\u2019s research group at Monash \nUniversity, Melbourne, Australia. The primary data required for this \nanalysis will be daily mean sea-level pressure data for the decades \n1991-2000, 2046-2055, and 2091-2100.

A change of only 1 % unit in global albedo corresponds to a change in surface temperature of as much as 1 K. In view of the relatively small year-to-year variations of the global mean temperature - not only during the contemporary record but during most of the Holocene - , the albedo has to remain remarkably stable. Which processes contribute to this stability and how might that have changed over the industrial period?The extent and type of clouds play a crucial role in determining the albedo. The global ensemble of clouds, most especially marine low clouds, therefore also has to be \"well behaved\" and could be part of a negative feedback (stabilizing) feedback loop. \nIn order to address this issue we would like to analyze the GCM albedo output and specifically study: \n\n- how the albedo varies over the year, from hemisphere to hemisphere, year to year and during the longer simulated periods \n\n- how the different models differ in these respects \n\n- the spatial scales of albedo variations \n\n- if there are systematic differences between the models that can be related e.g. to their cloud parameterization schemes. \n\n- how well or extensively the various models have been compared to the extant data on cloud type, cover and albedo. \n\n- the degree to which the models explicitly or implicitly have cloud albedo imbedded in a feedback loop.",

One such phenomenon, the Arctic Oscillation (AO), is the subject of the intended IPCC AR4 climate model analysis.  The objective will be to assess the relative ability of the participating models to capture the direction and magnitude of the observed upward trend in the winter AO index over the past 25 years, and by doing so identify key processes that modulate this fundamental mode of extratropical Northern Hemisphere climate.  This analysis will be conducted by Dr. Gavin Gong, Assistant Professor with the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University, and Dr. Dara Entekhabi, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Their recent work has focused on land surface feedbacks on climate change and the AO signal, specifically involving continental-scale snow anomalies. A preliminary hypothesis to be investigated is that negative surface snow anomalies result from anthropogenic warming, and also serve as a physically-based precursor for positive AO anomalies.  Thus land surface snow conditions may represent an important positive feedback in anthropogenically-forced AO trends, but one that is currently modeled with varying degrees of sophistication and accuracy in climate models.  Current generation models generally underestimate the magnitude of the recent upward AO trend; models with stronger snow representations may better simulate this observed trend.  Investigation of this hypothesis will require a number of standard data fields from each participating model, e.g., surface snow depth, surface temperatures, and geopotential heights and zonal wind throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere.",

To date, we have relied on only a few models for such estimates owing to availability. This multi-model project will enable us to estimate the unforced variability from a significantly larger number of models. We would like to participate in the \u201cmulti-model analysis activity\u201d by estimating the noise covariance that is required for the climate change detection problem for surface, upper-air and deep-ocean temperatures. One key issue is the short length of unforced control runs for estimating the noise covariance matrix.  Typically, a climate model control run is a few hundred years long and only yields a small number of independent 50 or 100 year segments that can be used as noise realizations.   We would create a multi-model ensemble from the available control simulations. A primary question is whether the estimates of C_N from the individual models are distinguishable from each other. If not, the multi-model ensemble should provide a significantly larger number of degrees of freedom to improve the estimated C_N. If they do differ, this would be an equally interesting result, and their differences would be one source of uncertainty in the detection analyses.\n\nThis would require the longest available time-series from the control run data as available for each coupled model. We would need the monthly mean (or seasonal or annual) of surface 2m air, upper-air (on standard pressure levels), and deep-ocean temperatures. ",

In particular, we intend to repeat the analysis shown in Figure 12.12 of the TAR using more recent model output and observational measurements.  This involves examining how well 20th Century simulations of the models reproduce observed long term and large scale surface air temperature changes through the use of the optimal detection method.  These results can then be translated into estimated contributions of various forcings to the observed 20th Century warming.  An update of this analysis would serve as a useful comparison of the state of our knowledge between the assessment reports.  We also intend to undertake an extension of the analysis by applying the most recent developments in the optimal detection methodology which allow for the inclusion of multiple models in a single analysis and which account for systematic errors in the model representations.  This extension will involve surface air temperature as well as precipitation and sea level pressure.  The data required will be annual means from transient simulations up to present including both anthropogenic and natural forcing and identical simulations but excluding either the anthropogenic or natural component.  Data from long control \nsimulations will also be required.",

Hence, aerosol and cloud variations have a strong  direct  signal on the downwelling shortwave surface irradiance which can be easily interpreted. At the same time, surface solar irradiance and its link to clouds and aerosols represents one crucial part of the cloud feedback loop. Furthermore, there has been increased interest in the scientific community regarding the long-term variability of the surface incoming solar irradiance. Observations show that solar irradiance has recently been decreasing in stations worldwide by about 4% from 1961-1990, possibly due to changed aerosol concentrations and cloud variations. This has been described as a global  dimming  effect. Current research (from satellite observations) shows a reversal of this effect from the late 1980s and during the 1990s. We will use two data sets, which represent two different classes of data retrieval methods, from satellites and in situ measurements: ISCCP-FD surface radiation fluxes (2.50  2.50, 3 hourly, 1984-2000) and broadband surface solar irradiance records from pyranometer measurements at sites worldwide from 1950s onwards (GEBA, USNSRDB, BSRN). We will compare the observed climatology and variability of the surface downwelling shortwave flux to four coupled climate models, the GISS model with two ocean submodels, the GFDL and NCAR models, on all resolved temporal and spatial scales. At the same time, and since the models use different aerosol datasets and cloud parameterizations, some use indirect cloud-aerosol effects, the inter-model comparisons of the solar irradiance at the surface will be instructive of the quality of each models  representation of cloud and aerosol impacts. In the proposed study we will a) assess the long-term variability and trend of the model downwelling shortwave flux at the surface and compare it to observations b)assess the aerosol and cloud effects in the models and, c) examine the models  capability in simulating specific events (volcanic eruptions and El Nino conditions).",

            "abstract": "This project examines the impact of greenhouse gas warming on soil moisture based on predictions of fifteen global climate models by comparing the after-stabilization climate in the SRESA1b experiment with the pre-industrial control climate. Instead of using a simple all-model averaging, this project focuses on the behaviors of majority models and emphasizes the consistency among different models.\n\nPrevious studies suggested a summer dryness and winter wetness of soil in mid- and high-latitudes as CO2 increases. However, the 15 models analyzed in this project are consistent in predicting summer dryness and winter wetness in only part of the northern middle and high latitudes. Slightly over half of the models predict year-round wetness in central Eurasia and/or year-round dryness in Siberia and mid-latitude Northeast Asia. In the tropics and subtropics, decrease of soil moisture is the dominant response in all seasons. Models are especially consistent in predicting drier soil over the US Southwest, the Mediterranean, Australia, and the South Africa in all seasons, and over much of the Amazon and West Africa in the JJA season and the Asian monsoon region in the DJF season. Since the only major areas of future wetness predicted with a high level of model consistency are part of the northern middle and high latitudes during the non-growing season, it is suggested that greenhouse gas warming will cause a worldwide agricultural drought. Over regions where there are considerable consistency among the analyzed models in predicting the sign of soil moisture changes, there is a wide range of magnitudes of the soil moisture response, indicating a high degree of model dependency in terrestrial hydrological sensitivity. A major part of the inter-model differences in the sensitivity of soil moisture response are attributable to differences in land surface\nparameterization.",

            "abstract": "Some years ago, the idea had been proposed (Ramanathan and Collins 1993) that clouds play a very important role in establishing the delicate heat balance in the Pacific warm pool area by providing a negative feedback \u2013 the so-called cloud thermostat. Several authors (Sun and Liu 1996 and Li 2000) have tried to incorporate ocean dynamical heating into the heat budget analysis. However, their attempts to formulate a dynamical thermostat hypothesis failed due to the inadequate assumption of zonal heat recycling in the tropical Pacific. The issue of cloud- and dynamical thermostats has not been resolved yet from a theoretical perspective. \n\nMoreover, climate model simulations tend to show a large uncertainty in their greenhouse warming temperature projections in the warm pool area, partly due to differences in cloud-representation and partly due to ocean dynamics. In a 4xCO2 simulations performed recently with the HadCM3 model (T. Toniazzo, personal communication) , warm pool temperatures rose up to 36 degree Celsius. Positive feedbacks seem to accelerate this warming and overcome cloud and dynamical thermostat effects. Such a potential change may have severe consequences for the global atmospheric circulation (Hoerling et al. 2001), encompassing the extratropics and also on ENSO amplitude (Sun 2003). So far the detailed reasons for the simulated model discrepancies have not been analyzed thoroughly.\n\nUsing the GFDL and NCAR IPCC scenario runs of the 20th-22nd century, we will study the heat balance of the warm pool, in terms of radiative processes and ocean dynamical heating. A revised thermostat theory, capturing meridional heat advection will be formulated and applied to the CGCM data. The goal of our planned research is to investigate the sensitivity of thermostats or super-greenhouse effects under greenhouse warming conditions. Physical processes that lead to different model responses will be identified. The amplitude of strong El Ni\u00f1o events is tightly linked to mean warm pool temperature. Hence, understanding the physics of thermostats or super-greenhouse effects will help to assess also ENSO's response to greenhouse warming. We are planning to generate time-series for the individual simulations of each term in the western and eastern Pacific heat-budget equation. Their behavior will shed light onto which process is dominating the heat-budget and which positive or negative feedbacks will win in the long run. Furthermore, simplified ENSO models will be used in order to understand how the simulated background state changes influence ENSO variability.\n\nRequired model data from the GFDL and NCAR IPCC (AR4) scenario runs (1-6, 8-10):\n\nIndo-Pacific ocean temperature data (all z-levels)\nIndo-Pacific ocean current data (all z-levels)\nIndo-Pacific atmosphere-ocean heat flux \nIndo-Pacific cloud data (level-wise and height-integrated water-vapor)",

            "abstract": "Climate model global warming simulations predict large regional changes in tropical rainfall, including regions of drought.  Qualitatively similar changes occur during El Nino interannual variability.  Using an intermediate climate model, we have identified a mechanism that creates regional reductions in precipitation at the margins of convection zones during warming.  In this ``upped-ante mechanism'', a warm troposphere increases the value of surface boundary layer moisture required for convection to occur.  In regions of plentiful moisture supply, moisture simply rises to maintain precipitation, but this increases the moisture gradient relative to neighboring subsidence regions.  Reductions in rainfall then result for those margins of convection zones that have strong inflow of air from the subsidence regions and less frequently meet the increased ``ante'' for convection. In the intermediate climate model simulations analyzed, the upped-ante mechanism is the leading cause of tropical drought in the global warming case and is dominant in certain El Nino drought regions.  In the ``anomalous gross moist stability mechanism\", gross moist stability is reduced due to increased ABL moisture.  As a result, convection is enhanced and precipitation becomes heavier over convective regions. While the upped-ante mechanism induces negative precipitation anomalies over the margins of convective regions, the anomalous gross moist stability mechanism induces positive precipitation anomalies within convective regions.  The importance of variation in gross moist stability, which is likely to differ among climate models, is suggested as a potential factor causing discrepancies in the predicted tropical regional precipitation changes. \n\nWe propose to evaluate the GCM output for the following relationships:  tropical tropospheric temperature and moisture relations; moisture increase in convection zones relative to other regions; relationship of drought to convective margins with inflow and to moisture gradients; terms from the moist static energy (MSE) budget useful to pathway diagnostics; contribution of surface fluxes over ocean regions as a signature of ocean dynamical feedbacks compared to other MSE budget terms.  These relationships will be evaluated for consistency with hypothesized mechanisms and for indications of other mechanisms that might be at work. \n\nDetailed evaluation will center first on changes for 30 year averages in the late 21st century when the warming is well established and the signals are large. We will begin with the SRES A1B case (relative to control) and the 2xCO2 equilibrium simulations with mixed-layer oceans which  provide a slightly simpler comparison case. Once we believe we have established a reasonable set of mechanisms and that the evaluation procedures are working, we will then apply to the other available runs and time periods. We will conduct a survey of precipitation changes over the available runs and time periods early on, to guesstimate if there will be suprises relative to A1B and add periods/runs to the initial evaluation if needed. \n\nBased on preliminary assessment of data from the IPCC/DDC site and from ECHAM4, we anticipate that the mechanisms will differ more among models than among scenarios for a given model.  We also have indications that the multi-model ensemble approach seen in IPCC AR3 has severe limitations for tropical rainfall anomalies.  For instance, at least one model that predict rainfall increases in subsaharan Africa does so because in the model climatology the region is in the center, not the margin, of a strong convection zone.  We postulate that it may be possible to constrain the model subset used for each region based on criteria for climatology We also have seen indications from AMIP2 data that the models behave quite differently, some rather imperfectly, in ENSO teleconnection response. Unfortunately, the AMIP2 data are not coordinated with AR4, although some models overlap.  We will take a preliminary look at using ENSO response as a means of evaluating quality of model response for particular sensitive regions, such as eastern equatorial South America, although this part is less likely to be completed in the tight time frame for AR4 turnaround. \n\nFields to be used include all surface and top-of-atmosphere fluxes, surface precipitation, and atmospheric 3-D winds, moisture and temperature.  While the data specifications did not include divergence or the divergent wind component nor certain moisture flux terms useful in MSE budgets, we will use the available data.  We can then provide feedback to the WGCM on the errors introduced by post-calculation of such terms, and on additional fields that it would be desirable to have for future comparisons for diagnosing tropical moist processes.

            "abstract": "Clouds have been classified as the highest priority by the U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative (USCCRI, 2001) because they are one of the largest sources of uncertainty in predicting any potential future climate change (Wielicki et al. 1995; Houghton et al. 2001). Clouds are also the dominant modulators of radiation both at the surface and top of atmosphere (TOA), and their impact on the Earth\u2019s radiation budget mainly depends on the bulk properties of clouds such as cloud amount, height, and microphsycal/optical features (Wielicki et al. 1998; Curry et al. 2000; Houghton et al. 2001). Characterizing cloud radiative effects on the surface is a critical component for understanding the current climate and an important step towards simulating potential climate change. Cloud radiative forcing (CRF) is a simple but effective means of studying cloud-radiation interactions and diagnosing problems in general circulation models (GCM) because the CRF represents the bulk effects of clouds on the surface radiation budget.\n\nWe are developing a climatology of mid-latitude continental cloud properties and their impact on the surface radiation budget using data collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) central facility (SCF; 36.6oN, 97.5oW; see (Ackerman and Stokes 2003) from January 1997 to December 2002. We calculate the cloud fractions of total, and single-layer low, middle, and high clouds, and their corresponding CRFs.  We rely entirely on both radar and lidar/ceilometer measurements to identify clear sky, total cloud cover, and single-layer low, middle, and high clouds first, then we average clear-sky net (down-up) SW and LW fluxes during a certain time period (a month or season), finally we calculate the seasonal and monthly mean SW, LW, and net CRF for each category. \n\nNow, we propose to compare our surface observations with CMIP's up-to-date monthly average outputs. We want to test whether the shortwave and long wave fluxes at the surface under different conditions between the observational and model results will be consistent. If they are consistent to each other, we may use the model outputs at TOA to calculate the atmosphere absorption.  If  they are not consistent to each other, what is the reason to cause the discrepancy?  \n\nThe parameters will be:\n(1)Clear-sky downwelling shortwave flux at the earth\u2019s surface\nThe radiative transfer model can accurately calculate the atmospheric absorption of solar radiation, therefore, the difference between the observational downwelling shortwave flux with the calculated clear-sky downwelling flux is expected to be small;\n\n(2)All-sky shortwave downwelling flux at the earth\u2019s surface\nThe cloud absorption to solar radiation is one of the biggest uncertainties in the GCMs. We try to find a way to calculate the cloud absorption by using model's TOA downwelling flux and the observed downwelling flux at the surface. Therefore, the comparisons between the model fluxes and the observational ones may help us to understand the cloud absorption to the solar radiation;\n\n(3)Cloud fraction \nWe compare this parameter to see whether the model gives the right order of the magnitude with the observed cloud amount in the same time period. \n\n(4)Cloud radiative forcing\nFinally, we want to compare the overall energy budget on the earth surface, and to see whether observed could effect on the surface is consistent to that of model output.",

Given the broad perspectives associated with the atmospheric hydrological cycle, our work will focus on two aspects that build upon our prior researches. The first aspect of the proposed work is on the trends and variability of precipitation and atmospheric temperature over the tropical land and oceans.  We will analyze the trends and variability of tropical precipitation, surface-air temperature, sea-surface temperature, soil moisture, 200-hPa geopotential height and large-scale overturning circulation simulated by the GCMs for the entire 140-year simulations.  Observations in the past 50 years or so will be utilized to validate the GCM simulations.  Discrepancies between GCM simulations and observations will be identified and the causes will be explored. The second aspect is on the warm rain processes over the tropical ocean.  We will analyze cloudiness, precipitation, and water vapor residence time (ratio of water vapor to precipitation) to document the recycling of water vapor, warm and cold rainfall efficiency, and their dependence on SSTs simulated by the three coupled models.  Results from the 140-year simulations of the three models will be inter-compared to discern the commonality and discrepancy among the models.  Recent observations, especially those from the satellite era, e.g., TRMM, GPCP, TOVS and ISCCP, will be used to validate and comprehend the GCM results.",

Our preliminary analysis using reanalysis as well as radiosonde data indicates that the Hadley cell and thus the tropics have been gradually widening by about 4\u00ba latitude over the past 40 years. An expansion of the tropics represents an extremely important aspect of climate change, which implies major changes in the general circulation. Current theory is unable to explain the magnitude of the observed trend, but various tropical, extratropical, or stratospheric mechanisms are undoubtedly at play. The importance of the Hadley cell for climate raises the question how well this trend is captured by model simulations of perturbed climates.  \n\nBased on an analysis of tropopause heights, we propose to analyze the latitudinal position of the Hadley cell from the latest IPCC simulations. The various results will be compared with each other as well as with observational data. Furthermore, we will analyze how the results are related to the simulation of other important parameters like the annular modes, tropical SSTs, the temperature structure in the UT/LS region, and the strength and position of the extratropical jets.\n\nThe realization of this projects requires monthly-mean three-dimensional fields of temperature, geopotential, and zonal velocity on all available pressure levels, and monthly mean SSTs.

Our objectives are to assess:  1. Do GCMs forecast (or hindcast) the interannual variability of seasonal rainfall in monsoon regions that we have been examining using reanalysis, satellite and in-situ data?  2. Is the relationship of simulated interannual precipitation variability to GCM generated sea surface temperature fields the same as in reanalysis or real data?  3. Can this information be used to generate an improved multi-model ensemble forecast of monsoon precipitation under future climate change? We will derive a multi-model ensemble forecast of the probability of changes in the seasonal precipitation and interannual variability during the 21st century (and possibly the 22nd and 23rd) using a combination of subjective and objective skill tests of the GCMs. Objectively, simulations of the 20th century can be compared to seasonal precipitation data, generating a skill score for each model. Recognizing that these climate simulations cannot forecast individual years, we would test the skill of model simulations of the seasonal mean and interannual variability for periods on the order of decades, and we would focus on area average precipitation for each monsoon region. For a 10-year period for example, each model would generate 10 ensemble-member forecasts (each ensemble member from one year of seasonal precipitation), and for example a rank probability skill score or cross-probability density function for each model would be assembled from the complete 20th century. Further analysis will help determine why individual models produce good or poor monsoon precipitation simulations. Correlations of interannual precipitation variability to SST (and lagged SST) would be examined for each model and compared to the correlations using climate data. Models that do not produce a reasonable monsoon simulation could be objectively excluded from a multi-model ensemble forecast of future climate change. Probabilistic forecasts of future monsoon precipitation will be determined using the skill of each model to generate a weighting function. Our primary objective would be to determine if a useful seasonal rainfall hindcast for monsoon regions could be calculated from GCM simulations, and then to apply the same procedure to monsoon precipitation forecasts in future climate change simulations in a form of nearest-neighbor forecast. We would primarily need only model precipitation and sea surface temperature fields for each GCM to carry out this research; however surface temperature, pressure and wind fields would be of interest in assessing the simulation of monsoon dynamics.\n",

One area of particular interest is the Tasman Sea.  Output from the CSIRO Mk2 and Mk3 models shows a local maximum in warming between Australia and New Zealand.  A brief survey of  other simulations available to us as part of another  CMIP sub-project showed the feature is common to many models, although the location and magnitude of the warming differs between models.  Observations also show that temperature and salinity have increased in parts of the Tasman Sea during recent decades and there is anecdotal evidence that warm-water species have spread south along the southeast coast during the same period.   \n\nOther ocean regions surrounding Australia are also of interest.  We plan to use the AR4 projections to develop scenarios of future marine climate change in Australia\u2019s oceans, as input to marine climate impacts studies.  The study will focus on changes in stratification, circulation (including boundary currents and major fronts) and water mass properties, with an emphasis on fields relevant to marine impacts (eg fisheries, biodiversity, coral reefs).  Diagnostic studies will be carried out to identify the dynamical mechanisms driving the projected changes.   We anticipate that the study of theTasman Sea and perhaps one or two other regions will be completed in time for the IPCC 4AR; the impacts studies themselves will likely take more time.  We plan to use output from the control and 20th century runs, plus some key SRES scenarios (eg A1B, B1 and A2, if available).  Model data required will include 3-D fields of ocean temperature  salinity and  velocities in the Indian and Pacific basins, horizontal and overturning streamfunctions, and air-sea forcing fields (wind stress, heat flux components, freshwater flux, sea-level pressure).  \n",

Methods of analysis such as the Continous Wavelet Techniques in Space and Time (CWT-ST) and the Intrinsic Mode Function techniques (IMF) would be used in this study.

Even the timescale for such an anomaly to pass around the Nordic Seas and sub-polar gyre is reproduced. Analysis suggests that these events are not purely advective but involve ocean-atmosphere coupling. It is proposed to examine the ubiquity of these events in different coupled model runs, and to what extent their characteristics change with a changing climate, focusing on correlation with changes to Arctic sea-ice flux through Fram Strait and the North Atlantic Oscillation. This work is proposed to be carried out by Grant Bigg and Edward Hanna of the Department of Geography, University of Sheffield. It requires 3D monthly-mean fields of ocean salinity, temperature and velocity over the Arctic and northern Atlantic north of 40N (surface fields would be adequate but restrict study of vertical extent of anomalies), and monthly-mean fields of sea-ice concentration and sea level pressure over the same region.",

The transient waves interact with low-frequency climate variations, and the interacting processes have been recently highlighted in the scientific community. However, there are still uncertainties how the transient wave activity will response to the climate changes and feedback to climate system. Therefore, we will investigate changes of transient wave activity over extra-tropical region and analyze its impact on the Asian monsoon variation in the IPCC AR4 Coupled GCM simulations. \n\nIn addition, we will investigate the role of air-sea coupled processes on the Asian monsoon simulation. Recently, we found that the several atmospheric GCMs, prescribed observed SST, have a poor performance for the simulation of anomalous Asian summer rainfall patterns (Kang et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2004). The models\u2019 deficiency results from failing to simulate correctly the relationship between the local summer rainfall and SST anomalies over warm pool region. The observed rainfall anomalies are negatively correlated with SST anomalies, whereas in nearly all atmospheric models, the rainfall anomalies are positively correlated with SST anomalies. This contrast implies that air-sea coupled processes play a critical role for the simulation of the East Asia Monsoon. Therefore, we will diagnose the Asian Monsoon simulation of the coupled GCMs, which have air-sea coupled processes, and study the role of air-sea coupled processes on the monsoon simulation. ",

Most models have difficulty in representing the characteristics of the MJO such as eastward propagation, amplitude and phase speed. Our objectives would be: 1) examine the degree to which the coupled models participating in the AR4 represent the chracteristics of the MJO and its modulation on extreme precipitation events 2) determine if global climate changes will have signficant impacts on the characteristics of the MJO and occurrences of extreme precipitation. Data necessary to perform the analysis would be primarily daily averages of upper and lower level winds (e.g. zonal winds at 850hPa and 200hPa), precipitation. At least 20 years of daily data during current climate and future climate runs would be necessary.",

Hence, in this context we propose to perform an intercomparison analysis of the various models included in the IPCC AR4 project. \nFirst, we would focus our attention on the statistical analysis of the energetics of the baroclinic waves as well as of the planetary waves, and of their interaction. This could be accomplished by adopting classical techniques such as the computation of the Hayashi spectra, as well as with new more sophisticated tools, based e.g. on wavelets, able to capture more efficiently the inherently localized aspect of the atmospheric mid-latitudes perturbations. \nA second goal of our analysis would be the study of how the low-frequency variability of the mid-latitudes atmosphere is altered with a changing. This could be accomplished by analyzing what are the effects of induced radiative forcing on the wave activity index, as well as using other techniques, based on EOF analysis. Finally, we propose to analyze how the greenhouse gases forcings alter the leading atmospheric regimes by determining how their joint PDF change with time.\nWe emphasize that the analyses we propose aim at understanding how the models differ in the representation of the changes to fundamental bulk atmospheric quantities, which have a deep physical meaning and play a major role in describing the global properties of the atmospheric dynamics.",

This builds on ongoing work examining the uncertainty, due to intermodel variability of GCM projections of precipitation and temperature, of projected hydrologic changes through 2100. This study uses monthly values of average temperature and precipitation from 10 GCMs (all of the models that participated in the most recent phase of CMIP, and that provided atmospheric data). The monthly GCM data are bias corrected using a quantile mapping technique that forces the monthly statistics of the GCM output for a climatological period to match the monthly statistics of the overlapping observations, while allowing evolution of the mean and variability of the GCM into the future. Spatial downscaling is performed by interpolating to 1/8 degree the ratio of each month\u2019s precipitation (from the GCM) to the climatological observed value for each GCM-scale grid cell, and interpolating the shift in temperature between the GCM and observed values. Daily values of precipitation and temperature at 1/8 degree are generated using random resampling from the historical record, with rescaling of precipitation and shifting of temperature so the monthly average matches the bias-corrected and interpolated monthly GCM values. These daily sequences from each GCM are used to drive a hydrological model, which ultimately generates streamflow at strategic points throughout California. The differences in mean values of monthly streamflows under a control run and a perturbed (1%/year increasing CO2) run are compared to the inter-model variability to examine which changes are consistent across models, and which are less so. Since the California region is highly dependent on snow accumulation and melt, the changes in the timing of the annual hydrograph are also tested for robustness of timing shifts between different GCMs. A final experiment is performed where identical precipitation is used for all GCMs, to isolate the contribution of temperature and precipitation variability between models to the overall variability. The proposed analysis will duplicate this study using the results submitted by the participating modeling groups. This study will examine the inter-model variability of hydrological impacts projected through 2100 for the participating GCMs, and contrast the inter-model variability between the two scenarios A1fi and B1. In each case, the inter-model variability will be statistically compared to the projected hydrologic changes, to quantify the significance level of the change in monthly flows and the shift in annual hydrograph peak.",

Among the models whose results are to be submitted to IPCC this time, some have atmospheric horizontal resolution as high as near 1 degree (T106 CCSR/NIES/FRCGC, N96 Hadley Centre, and T85 NCAR). We will compare the daily precipitation characteristics in the control (or 20C3M) runs of these models with the GPCP 1 Degree Daily data set focusing on extreme precipitation in terms of, for example, 99th percentile. Also, daily precipitation of all the models will be evaluated similarly at lower resolution (after converting all the data to, for example, 3 degree grid). After this validation process, the change in extreme precipitation in future climate in all the models will be assessed. The relationship between the change in extreme precipitation in each model with the changes in precipitable water, vertical motion, stability or other related variables will be analyzed. We will try to see if all the models show similar enhancement of heavy precipitation for similar reasons. If this is not the case, we will try to find any relationship between the systematic error of daily precipitation in control climate in a model and the future projection of daily precipitation with the model. From this result, we will discuss underlying mechanisms of the uncertainty, such as resolution dependence or parameterization dependence. If many similar analyses are proposed, we may concentrate our analysis on certain regions, that is, East Asia and Europe.\n\nRequested experiments: \nControl run, 1%/year CO2 increase run\n20C3M run, SRES A1B, B1 runs\nAMIP run\n\nRequested data: \nDaily 2-d: precipitation, sea level pressure, surface latent heat flux\nDaily 3-d: eastward and northward wind, and specific humidity (We actually wish to see daily 500hPa omega and vertically integrated water vapor flux convergence.

Global spectral energetics analysis introduced by Saltzman can resolve the complicated scale interactions in the wavenumber domain from meso to planetary scales. We have conducted comparative spectral energetics analyses for NCEP/NCAR, ERA-40, and JRA-25 reanalyses (Tanaka et al. 2004).  In the proposed study, we plan to conduct the comparative spectral energetics analysis for various climate model predictions under the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, using four times daily upper air data before and after the global warming. The analysis would show how the intensity of the general circulation would change by the global warming in the 21st century.",

According to our previous study for the MRI CGCM with a gradual increase in CO2 at a compound rate of 1 %/yr for 150 years, it is found that the Hadley circulation intensifies by 40 %, and the monsoon circulation decays by 20% in boreal summer when the global warming takes places in the 21st century.

GCM results, however, must exhibit a global energy balance between the net radiation flux at TOA and the net energy flux at ocean surface. AGCMs represented by AMIP GCMs often fail to establish this balance. However, most AMIP GCMs are robust in showing up certain relations between the net radiation flux at TOA and the net energy flux at the ocean surface in spite of the fact that SST had been prescribed. In principle, CGCM simulation results are a better framework since SST is not prescribed but calculated with other state variables. \n\nObjective:\nThe present study will examine how the state-of-the-art CGCMs exhibit the global balance between the net energy fluxes at TOA and ocean surface. The simulated energy budgets with CGCMs will be verified against the late 20th century observed climate (from 1971 to 2000). However, the main objective of the study is to understand how the ocean heat flux dictates the net radiation flux at TOA.\n\nData Required:\nVariables: \nEnergy fluxes: upward and downward, long wave and short wave radiation at both TOA and SFC; sensible heat flux, latent heat flux\nSurface hydrological variables: precipitation, evaporation, total runoff, snow amount, snow melt\n3-D variables: air temperature, specific humidity, and cloud water\nConcentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases \nLand surface type (or vegetation cover) or land/sea mask, and sea ice concentration or distribution.\nFrequency and period: monthly mean fields from January 1971 to December 2000\nModels: Atmosphere-Ocean Coupled GCMs",

            "abstract": "The participants have done considerable work on the summer monsoon rainfall variability over South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Extensive data sets have been used for periods varying from 1870 to 2000. The variability has been examined in relation to the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon (Weather 1997: 39-46 ; Int J Climatol 1997: 1155-1168 ; Theo Appl Climatol 1998:1-11 ; Int J Climatol 2001:603-616), Eurasian snow cover (Clim Dyn 1999: 475-489 ; Int J Climatol 2002: 1313-1325; Theo Appl Climatol 2003: 1-18), Global Warming (Natural Hazards 2003: 189-206) and the recently identified Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (Int J Climatol 2004: 1267-1282). All these studies have shown that with the analysis of available instrumental historical and other data sets, some valuable scientific insight can be gained on the Asian monsoons on inter-annual and decadal time scales. A few of the important results of these studies are as follows:\n\n* The short-term climate variability over these regions depicts decadal variability with certain epochs of above and below normal rainfall. While the epochs tend to last for three decades over South and East Asia, they last for about a decade over the equatorial regions of Southeast Asia. Further the turning points over East Asia follow those of South Asia about a decade later.\n\n* Impact of ENSO events on summer monsoon rainfall is modulated by the decadal behavior of rainfall ie impact of El Nino (La Nina) is more severe during the below (above) normal epochs. Thus impact depends on the prevailing epoch.\n             \n* The inter-connections between the monsoon-related events (rainfall over South Asia, rainfall over East Asia, northern hemisphere circulation, tropical Pacific circulation) appear to strengthen (or weaken) around the same time, for example the relationship among these events during 1890-1930 was weak while during 1930-1970 it was strong. Thus monsoon related events over geographically separated regions seem to get linked (or de-linked) around the same time periods.\n\nObjectives of the analysis:  \n\n    (i) To prepare regional summer monsoon rainfall time series over South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia from 20th through 22nd century\n    (ii) To examine inter-annual and decadal variability, long-term trends, short-term climate variability and other statistical properties of these three regional rainfall series \n    (iii) To prepare indices of the northern hemisphere mid-latitude (in particular over Eurasia) circulation and the Pacific circulation\n     (iv) To examine the relationship of these circulation indices with the regional rainfall series vis-\u00e0-vis the above results and to determine whether anthropogenic climate change has any role to play in these changing relationships.\n     (v) Compare the model-simulated results with the observed variability during the 20th century.\n\nThis group has been extensively using the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data sets, GrADS Graphics software and advanced statistical/mathematical techniques, hence expertise to analyze, interpret the multi-model data sets and computer facilities are available with this group at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.",

An assessment of the impact of SAM related variability over the regional response pre-impose a deep knowledge of this mode of circulation and its variability, particularly on the time-scale of decades to centuries.  Recent results suggest that the response of the SAM to increasing CO2 displays a robust upward trend in transient greenhouse warming integrations.  However, even though this basic agreement, questions remain about the timing and magnitude of the trends, and the spread among models and integrations.  The relationship of southern South America and neighboring oceans climate with SAM wind forcing is potentially strong. \n\nObjective: We propose to investigate the regional changes in the surface climatology that occur when the SAM index exceeds determined thresholds (corresponding to extreme cases of both negative and positive phases).

In this study, the NEA region includes (1) catchments of the russian rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean, (3) the terrestrial watershed of the Baltic sea including scandinavian rivers, and (3) the terrestrail watersheds of the Black, Caspian and Azov seas. Routinely, the analysis will start with evaluation of the model simulations of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, snow cover, etc. for the baseline climate. It will include both monthly and daily outputs. The next step will be an evaluation of the model performance in simulating the hidrological cycle components through the 20th century. Projections of the hydrological cycle component changes in NEA for the 21st century and the associated uncertainties will receive the central attention in this study. In addition to estimation of reproduced and projected changes in the multiyear means of the above variables, a particular attention will be given to changes in variability at different time scales, including changes of seasonality, as well as changes in extreme events and their frequency of occurrence (e.g. heavy precipitation, floods, droughts, etc.).",

The causes for this remain the subject of active research; one recent paper hypothesized that the temporal pattern of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific observed in the latter half of the 20th Century can induce an atmospheric response leading to decreased temperature, increased cloud cover, and increased precipitation in this region.  We propose to undertake an analysis of the AR4 GCM simulations, focusing on this observed regional feature of little or no warming.  The overarching question is this:  To what extent can GCMs reproduce this feature of the 20th Century climate and what are the implications of the answer for confidence in their 21st Century projections?  \n\nOur specific objectives are: \n(1) to determine whether any 20th Century CGCM simulation can reproduce the observed central and southeast U.S variations of temperature and precipitation; \n(2) to determine through process-oriented studies why models produce certain variations in the central U.S. with a particular, though non-exclusive, focus on processes related to SSTs; and \n(3) to determine to what extent the models project changes in these forcing processes in the 21st Century.  This analysis will complement ongoing work at our institution in which we are performing 21st Century regional climate model simulations using PCM and HadAM3 data as the lateral boundary conditions.  \n\nThe AR4 data sets needed are: \n(1) time series of 20th Century simulations, including the following specific variables: surface climate (temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloud cover, sea level pressure, wind speed and direction) for the U.S., upper air data (height, wind, temperature, specific humidity) at standard levels for North America and adjacent ocean areas, and global SSTs; and \n(2) time series of the same data for 21st Century simulations for the A1B, A2, and B1 emissions scenarios.",

The primary objective of this work is to evaluate how changes in wave variability associated with various CO2 forcing scenarios affect the stratospheric polar vortex in today's coupled climate models.   The questions to be addressed include how the polar vortex will change in the next century and if there a consensus among models as to the structure of these changes.  This work will also investigate how changes in the vortex will affect the troposphere through changes the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Recent studies suggest that the stratosphere may directly and/or indirectly influence tropospheric climate through the AO, and thus changes to the tropospheric wave spectrum may influence stratospheric circulation and indirectly tropospheric climate. The relationships between meridional temperature gradients and large scale wave amplitudes will also be characterized in the model simulations to evaluate connections between surface warming and stratospheric circulation  The analysis will use a variety of diagnostics including EOFs and Fourier decomposition. These investigations will be completed by Dr. Cordero and his graduate students at San Jose State University.  The model data required to complete this study include the following atmospheric variables.  Monthly averaged, east wind, north wind, omega (vertical wind), temperature and geopotential height at standard pressure levels up to 10hPa.  Simulations with higher altitude data will compared as a subgroup to compare with simulations that have a lower altitude (~10hPa) top boundary.",

The variability of the ITF, therefore, affects not only the heat and freshwater budgets of the Indo-Pacific basin, but also the global climate. Thus, it is critical for global climate models to simulate the ITF transport and water mass properties correctly to address climate change issues. However, the extremely complex topography of the Indonesian Seas imposes substantial challenge to numerical modelers, and the skills of those global climate models in reproducing the ITF characteristics are largely unknown. In addition, because of the sparseness of observations on the ITF, there is need to study the ITF variabilities in numerical models, which has been done mostly in ocean-only models. \n\nThis proposed study has two objectives: \n(1) assess the coupled model simulations of the transport and water mass properties of the ITF by comparing the model simulations with observations (which include mooring measurements, XBT, CTD measurements from ARLINDO project) and intercomparing among models; and \n(2) investigate the variabilities, both natural variabilities and those forced by greenhouse gases, of the ITF transport in the coupled models on various time scales and their relationship with large scale wind fields and phenomena such as ENSO. \n\nThe model outputs we need are: \n(1) temperature, salinity, horizontal velocities in eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean; \n(2) sea surface temperature of the Pacific and Indian Oceans; \n(3) near surface wind fields. This study will not only provide scientific results for the IPCC report, but also serve the general interest of the scientific community in the ITF variabilities in coupled climate models.",

Dr. Lobato is currently a PI of the NAME science working group. The main goal here is to determine what possible changes in the interannual and interdecadal variations of the North American Monsoon would occur in the 21st century under various climatic scenarios. \n \nRecently, Higgins et al. (1998) demonstrated that interannual variability of the continental-scale precipitation pattern closely imitates the seasonal changes associated with the development of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). It is important to determine to what extent this pattern is captured in coupled GCMs. On the other hand, recent coupled GCM and observational studies (e.g. Latif and Barnett 1994; 1996) have implicated Namias\u2019s hypothesis in the decadal variability of the North Pacific-North American sector.  Namias argued that SSTA in the North Pacific influence the atmospheric transients, hence the mean westerly flow in such a way as to reinforce the original SSTA.  \n \nModel Data Required: Precipitation, surface temperature, pressure, wind, geopotential height, radiation fields, and cloudiness monthly data of the following products:\n \n1.  20th century simulation to year 2000, then fix all concentrations at year 2000 values and run to 2100 (CO2 ~ 360ppm).\n \n2.  21st century simulation with SRES A1B to 2100, then fix all concentrations at year 2100 values to 2200 (CO2 ~ 720ppm) &#61664; we require just up to 2100.\n \n3.  21st century simulation with SRES B1 to 2100, then fix all concentrations at year 2100 values to 2200 (CO2 ~ 550ppm) &#61664; we require just up to 2100.\n \n4. 21st century simulation with SRES A2 to 2100.\n \n6.      100 year (minimum) control run including same time period as in 1 above.",

How is the statistical precision of these estimated indicator distributions related to model run length?  How do models differ with respect to specific distributional characteristics such as the inter-annual median and upper/lower quartiles? Toward this end I will explore model run estimates of the inter-annual variation of global mean surface temperature, zonal mean surface temperatures, zonal and seasonal 24-hour extreme temperature frequencies, and possibly precipitation indicators.   For purposes of statistical inference I will use modern statistical tools based on data resampling.  I will use equilibrium model outputs that are beyond the period of transient response to CO2 forcing.  Monthly output values are sufficient for mean value indicators, but for 24-hour extremes it will be necessary to use the more limited daily model output values.  It appears that relevant data should be available from experiments numbered 6,7,8,9 as described in the IPCC Standard Output document.",

The results have offered evidence that the CO2-induced response pattern is closely related to the model natural variability, though the selection of mode and polarity referring to the natural variability is not deterministic among the models. Several models indicate a response pattern projected on the spatial structure of the ENSO (El Nino-like or La Nina-like) that is the leading mode of natural variability, while others indicate a response pattern projected on those of higher modes. A similar analysis of wintertime field variables in the Northern Hemisphere has confirmed the relationship (Noda & Yamaguchi 2001). Several models indicate a response pattern projected on the spatial structure of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) that is the leading mode of natural variability, while other models indicate a response pattern projected on those of higher modes. Moreover, the analysis relating both regions has suggested that the effects of ENSO and AO upon the response pattern overlap over the North Pacific; the balance of domination between ENSO and AO in this region plays a key role for the entire response pattern in determining the selection of mode and polarity referring to the natural variabilities. In this early study, we had to use the limited types of surface atmospheric data available. Therefore, it is highly desirable that we be allowed to use the newer and more extensive collection of PCMDI data to confirm and extend our previous study.",

Thus it is possible that mineral aerosols will change in the future due to climate change impacts on vegetation, precipitation and wind speeds.  Two studies have looked at the impact of future climate change on desert dust [Mahowald and Luo, 2003; Tegen et al., 2004] and came up with different sensitivities (20-60% decrease, or +/-20%, respectively).  Part of these differences are likely to be due to differences in coupled models, and part due to differences in the methodologies used.  In this CMIP study, we propose to use the methodology of Mahowald and Luo, 2003 with the different models to look at changes in desert dust source regions due to climate change and carbon dioxide.  Although we may not be able to include accurately the impact of wind speed changes (because of the non-linearity of the dust source relationship to wind speed), we should be able to predict from monthly mean surface temperature, precipitation and cloudiness changes in desert areas, and their impact on desert dust source areas using the BIOME3 (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996) equilibrium vegetation model.  We propose to do this for all available models for future climate, and submit the resulting paper before May, 2005.  This will allow us to assess the uncertainty in future desert dust source areas due to model uncertainties in precipitation, temperature and cloudiness changes, and possibly also due to wind speed changes in the source regions.",

This\ninvolved tuning the main parameters of MAGICC (climate sensitivity, effective oceanic diffusivity, etc.) against AOGCM results for different variables such as global-mean temperature, land-ocean temperature differentials, etc. So-tuned, MAGICC was able to emulate the global-mean temperature and oceanic thermal expansion results from individual AOGCMs with high accuracy, justifying its use to expand these results to cover emissions scenarios not considered directly by the AOGCMs.\n\nThe first part of this project will use the new AR4 AOGCM results in the same way so that these new models may also be emulated with MAGICC. This is directed towards the possible use of MAGICC to produce a wider spectrum of global-mean temperature (and sea level) projections for AR4 than would otherwise be available. This work will be carried out by Wigley and Raper. Santer is involved to assist in accessing appropriate data from the AR4 data files. Nychka is involved to assist in applying more rigorous statistical tools than previously to the AOGCM/MAGICC comparisons that underlie the calibration exercise. All investigators will be involved in analysis and interpretation of the results. The plan is to perform the calibrations using 1% CO2 experiment results (accounting for control-run drift if necessary) and to test these calibrations with data from other forcing experiments. \n\nFor this work to be carried out effectively we require, ideally, annual-mean, gridpoint data from (at least) 1% CO2 runs and the parallel control runs for: reference height temperature, sea surface temperatures, and ocean temperatures through the full ocean column. The latter are used to determine net changes in ocean heat content, which is the most accurate way to quantify heat flux into the ocean. We also require oceanic thermal expansion data, some indicator of changes in the thermohaline circulation, and the top of the troposphere radiative forcing for 2xCO2 (after stratospheric equilibration). For testing against other forcing experiments we require estimates of the total forcing time series for these experiments and the breakdown of this forcing between land and ocean in each hemisphere.\n\nThe second part of this project involves the use of a new GSIC model developed by Sarah Raper to quantify future changes in this component of the ice-melt contribution to sea level rise. The use of this model will be a major conceptual advance on the way GSICs were modeled in the TAR \u2013 where an ad hoc correction factor produced an unrealistic upper bound to GSIC melt. These calculations will be carried out on a gridpoint basis over the globe (for regions where GSICs exist) and will use the temperature data requested for the MAGICC calibration exercise. Santer will assist in data extraction, and Nychka will assist in the application of rigorous statistical methods.    ",

Until now, there are many studies on the heating processes related to the seasonal evolution of the Asian summer monsoon. Ueda et al. (2003, J. Climate) has revealed that pre-monsoon heating in the western part of the Tibetan Plateau exhibits hybrid nature of &#65308;wet&#65347; and &#65308;dry&#65347; processes. Ishizaki and Ueda (2004) analyzed the heat and moisture budget over the Indochina Peninsula and obtained presence of condensation heating as well as the sensible heat supply from the land surface. Recently, Ueda and Kawamura (2004, Int. J. Climatol.) has indicated that the springtime anomalous tropical heat source over the Indian Ocean, relevant to a cold episode of the El Nino, can affect midlatitude atmosphere through direct heat-induced response to the atmosphere and cause to change ensuing Asian summer monsoon. However, few studies are available on longer time-scale. Thus, the purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the change of heat and moisture budget, especially over the Asiatic landmass in boreal summer. The main data to be used is monthly mean 3-D atmosphere data (air temperature, horizontal wind, specific humidity, omega, geopotential height). Additional data required for the heat and moisture budget analysis are monthly net down/up-ward short/long- wave radiation flux and precipitation.\n",

Sea ice retreat implies increased evaporation and thus can lead to increased cloud formation, though it is unclear how the clouds will actually respond as their formation depends not only on the local moisture budget but on synoptic patterns and the advection of heat and moisture. The simulation of these processes vary significantly among the models which is in part responsible for the contribution of clouds to the uncertainty in the ice-albedo feedback magnitude. The difficulty in estimating the effects of sea ice and clouds on radiation has been aggravated by lack of long and accurate data sets of the TOA radiative fluxes and clouds in the polar regions. Availability of the new satellite data from the NASA EOS program provides an opportunity to investigate the strength of the sea ice and cloud cover influence on the TOA albedo.\n\nProject description:\tWe intend to analyze the outputs of coupled GCMs in order to evaluate model simulations of sea ice and cloud effects on the reflected solar radiation. The model results will then be compared to the observations which will include monthly TOA radiative fluxes (CERES/ERBE); sea ice concentrations  (HadISST1 and MODIS); and cloud properties (MODIS, TOVS Polar Pathfinder, and available ground-based observations). The main objectives of the project are: 1) to compare seasonal variability of sea ice concentrations and polar cloud properties simulated by the models and in observations; 2) Estimate how much changes in sea ice concentration affect the TOA albedo during various cloud conditions; 2) Study the relationship between the fraction and optical depth of low-, mid-, and upper-level clouds and the TOA albedo; 3) Study the covariability of sea ice cover and cloud properties and assess how much clouds are affected by sea ice changes; 4) compare the sea ice, cloud, and TOA albedo changes in the future climate runs from different models.\n\nModel data required: 1) TOA radiative fluxes; 2) Surface heat fluxes: latent and sensible heat fluxes; shortwave, and longwave radiative fluxes; 3) Low-, mid-, and high-level cloud properties; 4) sea ice concentration; 5) surface ice and ocean temperature; 6) winds at all levels; 7) divergence of heat and humidity at all levels.",

A main focus is the quantification of the model uncertainty, i.e. the uncertainty arising from the large range of projections given by different climate models. Data from the Working Group on Coupled Models will be needed in order to test and compare different methods of quantification of the model uncertainty. These methods include a method originally designed using information theoretic entropy. All the runs that allow us to compare the outcomes of different coupled models with common assumptions can be useful (e.g. the control run, the transient run for the 20th century).",

For each model and time of year, precip and temperature anomalies corresponding to specified expected return periods will be estimated. Hence, for example, the precip associated with a 50-year flood will be estimated for each model. Similar studies of drought, heat and cold wave frequency will be made.

The partitioning between atmospheric and oceanic heat transport is not trivial. Recent studies show that in the tropics atmospheric and oceanic heat transport changes may act in concert while others argue that they compensate in the midlatitudes. Changes in heat transport relate to changes in stability and circulation of both the atmosphere and ocean. It is unclear how the climate reorganizes under greenhouse forcing to accommodate these changes. Projections will differ as the mean circulation (e.g. atmospheric cells, storm tracks, MOC, gyres) and major modes of variability such ENSO and the NAO respond different in different numerical models, which calls for the need of multi-model ensembles. We intend to analyze the response of the heat transport to changes in radiative forcing and relate it to circulation changes in atmosphere and ocean.  This analysis will give a succinct description of global change simulated by the IPCC models and put it into a dynamic perspective. \n\nObjectives:\n-Determine the decadal ensemble mean and spread of oceanic and atmospheric poleward heat transport and its different components in the 20th and 21st century from the multi-model IPCC model output (gyre, overturning, transient eddy, standing eddy)\n-Relate the changes of poleward heat transport to changes in circulation and to changes in stability \n-Relate the changes of poleward heat transport to changes in major modes of climate variability (in particular, ENSO, PDO, TAV, NAO, SAM)\n\nCoupled model data requirements (if possible monthly means, if datasets become too large annual means on many variables can be sufficient; data from 20th century control and a 21st century perturbed, either SRES A1B or B1):\n\nOceanic data:\nTotal, gyre, overturning, and eddy heat transport (total and per basin).\nmeridional velocity (gridpoint)\ntemperature (gridpoint)\nmeridional mass overturning circulation  (total and per basin)\n\nAtmospheric data:\nmeridional velocity (gridpoint)\ntemperature (gridpoint)\nhumidity (gridpoint)\neddy fluxes of heat and moisture transport (v\u2019T\u2019 and v\u2019q\u2019; gridpoint)\nsurface fluxes (latent, sensible, radiative; gridpoint)\ntop of the atmosphere fluxes (gridpoint)\nsea level pressure (gridpoint)",

Our interest relates to the ecological impacts of climate change:  analyses of fossil pollen records and GCM simulations suggest that late-glacial plant communities with no modern counterpart in North America grew in response to climates more seasonal than any experienced in NA today (Williams et al. 2001).  Similar patterns are observed in mammalian community structure.  If 'no-analog' climates occur in the future, one likely ecological consequence is the development of novel floral and faunal communities. Novel future climates also challenge our ability to forecast ecological (and social) responses to future climate change.  This project will seek to 1) identify whether 'no-analog' future climates are likely and 2) if so, identify areas and ecosystems that may be particularly vulnerable. Analyses would use dissimilarity metrics to 1) calculate local rates of climate change between 2000 and 2100AD and 2) calculate the distance between 2100AD climate gridpoints and their closest modern analogs in order to assess whether 2100AD climates are outside the modern climate space.",

            "abstract": "We propose to analyze the response of mean humidity in the tropical upper troposphere to changes in convective-mean tropical SST. Recent work based on analysis of satellite measurements has shown that interannual changes in both specific and relative upper tropospheric humidity (UTH, 10-14 km) are correlated with SST changes within regions of deep convection.  As the water vapor feedback  by tropical UTH is expected to play a crucial role in the radiative forcing of climate change, it is thus important to understand the characteristics of coupled climate model responses in this area. We would like to examine the mean and statistical distribution of UTH responses from the multi-model dataset.  Specifically, we wish to use output from run 6 (100 year control run) in order to compare interannual relationships with observations.  As time permits, we will examine how long-term trends in mean UTH and convective-mean SST are related in run 5 (1%/yr CO2 increase, doubling in 70 years). Model data required will be monthly mean SST(lat,lon,month), TOA outgoing longwave flux(lat,lon,month) to define area of active convection, specific humidity(lat,lon,month,pres=250,200,150 hPa), and air temperature(lat,lon,month,pres=250,200,150 hPa).",

The object would be to investigate the balance in models between the thermocline and local wind feedback loops of the ENSO cycle in the current and future climates (Fedorov and Philander 2001, Burgers and van Oldenborgh 2002).  This will be done by studying the properties of an ICM with parameters fitted to the GCM output: SST equation, statistical atmosphere and shallow water ocean model.  We have just submitted a paper with a similar anlaysis of the CCSM 1.4 model (available from http://www.knmi.nl/~oldenbor). \n\nThe project requires monthly fields of zonal wind stress, heat fluxes, SST and Z20.  If Z20 or another proxy for thermocline depth is not available the 3D ocean temperature fields of the upper 200m of the ocean (preferably on the original grid) are needed.  The spatial extent should be the equatorial Indo-Pacifc (30E-90W, 15S-15N).  We would analyse the coupled ocean-atmosphere models in the current climate, scenario runs and fixed doubled and quadrupled CO2.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.knmi.nl/publications/abstract.php?id=649\">http://www.knmi.nl/publications/abstract.php?id=649</a>",

            "abstract": "The radiative feedback from clouds remains one of the largest uncertainties in determining climate sensitivity. Traditional methods of evaluating clouds in general circulation models (GCMs) have focused on comparing multi-annual mean maps of cloud variables with satellite observations. However, the ability to simulate the time-mean geographical distribution of present-day cloud may not offer a stringent constraint on the cloud radiative feedback under climate change. A possible alternative approach is to identify key processes associated with the cloud response to climate change, which are demonstrated to be important in a range of GCMs, and attempt to find analogues in present day climate variability. Compositing techniques to define \u2018regimes\u2019 (dynamical regimes, cloud regimes, physico-dynamical regimes, etc.) have been shown to be especially useful in separating particular processes, however there are a number of different compositing methods in the literature, many of which have not, to date, been demonstrated to constrain the cloud response to climate change. \n\nThe Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) has two sub-projects (sub-projects 1 and 3) which aim to test a range of these compositng methods in \u00b12K atmosphere-only and 2xCO2 atmosphere-mixed layer ocean experiments. It would be extremely valuable to extend these techniques to coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations, in order to test the generality of the results in a full coupled system. The CFMIP diagnostic list was designed with the requirements for cloud compositing as a focus. In particular, the project requests high temporal resolution (daily) data from the ISCCP simulator. ISCCP simulator diagnostics are marked as \u2018lower priority output\u2019 in the CMIP lists and only requested as monthly means, hence not all of the analysis to be carried out on the CFMIP experiments can be repeated on the CMIP models. However, some of the simpler cloud compositing techniques being utilised in CFMIP either do not use ISCCP simulator output, or use monthly mean ISCCP data. We intend to apply these techniques to the 1%/year simulations in CMIP in order to test whether there are significant differences in cloud processes occurring as part of transient climate change in a full coupled system compared with the equilibrium climate in more idealised atmosphere-mixed layer and atmosphere-only experiments. It will also form a valuable test of the generality of the conclusions from the CFMIP compositing sub-projects for the IPCC AR4.       ",

            "abstract": "In the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC climate change scenarios with credible uncertainty estimates are available only globally or for large-scale patterns/footprints. Regional change scenarios exist, but they are based on multi-model agreement, at best, rather than some estimate of model skill. The current inability to provide a strong basis for evaluating scenario credibility at the regional level constitutes a fairly serious methodological gap, which this research purposes to fill. The probabilistic climate change scenarios will address several of the priorities of the IPCC research, including examination of changes in interannual variability as well as long-term trends and how those changes manifest themselves at the regional scale. The work builds on existing methodologies used at the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI) for verifying dynamical models and constructing probabilistic seasonal-to-interannual climate forecasts. The work consists of two main parts: \n\n* Verification of the performance of 20th Century temporal characteristics, such as the trends in multi-decadal means and the interannual variability about those means, from the AOGCMs used for 21st Century climate change predictions; and, \n\n* Construction of probabilistic multi-model scenarios for 21st Century climate and its variability, using the results from (1) as an objective basis for assigning weights to the model predictions. \n\nThe analyses will be performed spatially from the grid scale to the regional scale for near-surface air temperature and precipitation. The required data are monthly-mean precipitation and near-surface air temperature from the AOGCMs that are producing ensemble runs.\n\nThe methods employed in this research, applying techniques of multi-model ensembling that are based on model performance, have not yet been applied in the context of climate change predictions and can pilot further research for future IPCC reports. The findings of this research also can be used to set the longer-range context for seasonal-to-interannual climate variability and predictions. The suggestion here is that proper synthesis of seasonal forecasts, and longer-term assessments, taking into account the uncertainties of each, provides the best opportunity to minimize losses, take advantage of opportunity, and work toward sustainable practices.",

            "abstract": "Mode waters, as they ventilate in the thermocline, carry information about surface conditions at their formation regions into the ocean interior. Variabilities in their properties are thus potential indicators of changes in surface forcing. For example, Banks et al. (2000) found that Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) is a potentially sensitive indicator of anthropogenic climate change. This deduction was based on a comparison of the observed changes of the water mass between two snapshots (1962 and 1987) with that simulated by a climate model (HadCM3) driven by anthropogenic forcing. The simulated freshening and cooling were comparable with that observed in both magnitude and pattern. A recent survey along 32 deg-S in the Indian Ocean provided another snapshot (2002), showing that there has been a reversal of the SAMW freshening  trend with the water mass properties being almost identical to their 1962 values (Bryden et al. 2003). However, this reversal is not reproduced by any of the HadCM3 simulations. Instead, the freshening trend continues in model experiments that include anthropogenic forcing. A comprehensive analysis of the SAMW in HadCM3 recently conducted by Stark et al. (2004), making use of a large set of ensemble experiments with different atmospheric forcing scenarios, concludes that the observed decadal variability of the SAMW can only be explained by internal variability, and that the persistent freshening trend in simulations with anthropogenic forcing is due to a combination of shallow model mixed layers and elevated model wind stress, precipitation and Tasman inflow. \n\nThe modified conclusion described above emphasizes the dependence of our understanding of climate variability on direct ocean observations, as well as the benefits of extensive numerical experimentations. With the latter in mind, we propose to analyse the multi-model dataset to be collected for the IPCC AR4,  our objective being to quantify internal variability of SAMW and its response to anthropogenic forcing. We shall evaluate each of the climate models in terms of ocean heat transport and the large scale ocean circulation as in Jia (2003), as well as the SAMW properties. Based on this initial evaluation, we shall select a subset of the models for a detailed investigation of the nature of the SAMW variability using control experiments and experiments with different forcing scenarios.

            "abstract": "The largest warmings over the last several decades were observed in high latitudes. Cai (2004) proposed that part of the large amplitude climate warmings in high latitudes can be explained by the so-called \u201cdynamical amplifier\u201d mechanism. The dynamical amplifier mechanism requires a net increase of poleward heat transport due to an increase of greenhouse gases. Such an enhanced poleward heat transport must imply that an increase in net radiation energy surplus (deficit) in low- (high-) latitudes. Therefore, one can deduce the high-latitude surface warmings due to the dynamical amplifier feedback from the change of deficit (surplus) of the net radiation flux at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). It should be emphasized here that one would not be able to identify such a change in the net radiation flux at the TOA if the amplified warmings in high latitudes were caused by local thermodynamic feedbacks (e.g., ice-albedo feedback) only.\n\nThe radiation energy budget at the TOA can be used to directly address if the poleward heat transport has been intensified or not. We are planning to carry out the budget analysis using the ERA40 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, and climate simulations produced by various centers available at the PCMDI website. We wish to confirm if the climate simulations produced by these centers show an enhanced poleward heat transports when the models are forced with anthropogenic forcings. If so, what is the relation between the amount of high-latitude warmings and the change in the highlatitude radiation deficit at the TOA. We hope to quantify the uncertainties of the climate model simulations and separate those factors that are associated with circulation changes from those that are related local thermodynamics feedbacks.",

To reduce these uncertainties, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology established two comprehensive datasets of the worldwide measured surface radiative fluxes, the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA, Gilgen et al. 1998), and the database of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN, Ohmura et al. 1999). These datasets have been widely used in the past for the assessments of surface radiation fields in climate models. In this project we intend to use these observational datasets for the evaluation of the new coupled model simulations carried out for the IPC 4th assessment report.  Expertise for this work has inter alia been gained in the  AMIPII diagnostic project No, 32 surface and atmospheric radiation budgets in AMIP II GCMs. In addition to the assessment of the model performances under present day conditions, we intend to analyze the future evolution of the surface radiative fluxes. A particular focus will be on the longwave downward radiation, which we consider as a key quantity amongst the surface energy balance components under changing climates (Wild and Ohmura, GEWEX news, 14 (4), 2004). The longterm monitoring of the longwave downward radiation is also a major aim of the BSRN programme. Finally we are interested in the evolution of the downward solar radiation at the surface, since we have been heavily involved in the analysis of decadal changes of this quantitiy, related to the issue of solar dimming versus solar brightening.",

An important question is whether climate changes caused by anthropogenic activities will change the intensity and frequency of extreme events. It is therefore of great interest to document the projected changes in extremes as simulated by modern global climate models.\n\nObjective: Evaluate projected changes in simulated extremes of near surface temperature, precipitation and wind speed.\n\nMethodology: Extreme events and their changes will be evaluated in terms of return values of annual (and possibly seasonal) extremes at every grid point (Kharin and Zwiers 2000, 2004; Wehner 2004). The analysis of other extreme value statistics such as changes in threshold exceedance frequencies, changes in heating, cooling and growing degree days etc. is possible, provided daily data are available.\n\nData: gridded fields of monthly extremes of (2m) Tmax, (2m) Tmin, 24-h PCP, (10m) wind speed.

This in turn can act to reduce the upwelling across isopycnals, which can reduce the communication of tracers from the abyss to the surface.  In addition, it may also change the volume of water which outcrops at the surface in the polar latitudes, changing the pathways of water formation and tracer cycling.  As the surface warms and/or freshens and certain isopycnals cease to outcrop, tracers along these isopycnals will be isolated from the surface and sequestered in the ocean on time scales shorter than diffusive time scales, but this may also limit the future capacity of tracer uptake at the surface.  This will have particular relevance in the Southern Ocean, where tracers are brought to the surface and cycled back into the interior. \n\nNecessary Data:  Ocean potential temperature, salinity, potential density, vertical velocity, surface heat flux correction, and surface freshwater flux from several models and for the climate change scenarios extending for long periods in time (eg, #8: A1B and B1 going to year 2300).

A closed circulation connects the EM with the Asian Monsoon, AM, (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996), and a weaker one resembles a Hadley circulation across eastern North Africa (Ziv et al. 2004). \nAir back-trajectories demonstrate that the EM is connected at the lower-troposphere with Europe, at the mid-troposphere with eastern North Africa and at the higher-troposphere with the AM (Ziv et al. 2004), who also found that the two competing dynamic factors are correlated with each other, and attributed this to the linkage between them and the AM. Accordingly, an intensification of the AM enhances both the subsidence, via the circulation connecting them, and the Etesian winds, due to the enhanced pressure gradient between the two regions. The above implies that the AM prevent each of this factor to dominate, so that it has a moderating effect on the EM summer regime.\n\nSaaroni et al. (2003) found a significant warming, combined with intensification of extreme heat waves, over the EM along 1948-2003. This may indicate a possible disruption of the circulation connecting the AM with the EM, or change in the variability and intensity of the AM itself. This subject is being studied now for the past, i.e., 1948-2003 period.\n\nThe proposed research:\nWe would like to study the following subjects for the summer season (JJA), together with the adjacent months, i.e., April-October: \n1. The future evolution of the Asian Monsoon: seasonality, intensity, variability and structure \n2. The future relation between the AM and the subsidence over the Eastern Mediterranean \n3.

An improved understanding of the processes that set the frequency and amplitude of El Ni\u00f1o events is a key element underpinning the development of climate prediction on seasonal and longer timescales. Also imperative is a better understanding of how the processes critical to El Ni\u00f1o are represented in coupled climate models, and how systematic biases in  modelled climate may impact upon them. Errors in the simulation of El Ni\u00f1o have been cited in the IPCC AR3 as a major source of uncertainty in projections of future climate change. \n\nBy swaping ocean and atmosphere components in coupled GCMs, recent work has shown that the atmosphere component has a dominant role in defining El Ni\u00f1o frequency and base amplitude (Guilyardi et al. 2004). In particular, higher atmosphere resolution dramatically improves the low frequency spectra of El Ni\u00f1o. Even though this emphasis may be due to shortcomings in present-day atmosphere GCMs, more work is needed to elucidate the reasons behind this result.\n\nThe IPCC AR4 coupled simulations database provides a unique opportunity to further document this issue in the most recent coupled GCMs of the community. In addition, the analysis will focus on a number of key diagnostics (like the coupling strengh) likely to shed some light on the dominant role of the atmosphere component.\n\nModel data required:\n- all monthly means, over 100 years minimum (CF/netCDF preferably)\n\nAtmosphere: MSLP, zonal/meridional wind stress, downward heat fluxes \n(SW, LW, turbulent), downward mass fluxes (E, P, R), CRF (LW, SW), \ncloud cover(s)\n\nOcean: SST, SSS, T (3d down to 500 m), S (3d down to 500 m), U(3d), V(3d), \nW(3d), mixed-layer depth (density criterion), heat content of first 300m, \ndepth of 20C, sea-level, [and equation of state used]\n\n\nReference:\nGuilyardi  E., S.

The uncertainties in climate models' forecasting capability of which we speak derives from the empirical nature of their parameterization of sub-gridscale processes, especially those having to do with clouds, convection, and ocean-air interaction. In our research activity we will use the output of forced runs from several climate models contributing to the IPCC 4AR archive to quantify the range of uncertainties in climate model sensitivity. Our focus will be on global scale atmospheric responses in particular phenomena, such as changes in the Hadley circulation and resulting patterns of precipitation change, the strength and position of the mid-latitude storm track, and the stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation. We will simulate the differences in climate models' responses to a given forcing as they would appear in spectrally resolved infrared radiance and microwave refraction, the observables of two candidate climate benchmarking missions. The results for changes in infrared spectra will be compared to the difference between IRIS, an infrared interferometer flown in 1970-1971, and IMG, an infrared interferometer flown in 1997-1998.",

For example, Trenberth et al. (2003) argued that in a warmer climate, where the amount of atmospheric moisture is expected to rise faster than the total precipitation amount, increases in precipitation intensity must be offset by decreases in precipitation frequency.  However, these characteristics have been subject to limited analysis using observations and models.  Evaluating the global distribution of these parameters from observations and testing how well climate models deal with these characteristics of precipitation is the focus of this project.\n\nTechnical approach\n    Precipitation frequency, intensity and the index that reflects the major precipitation events will be investigated separately.  According to the available model outputs,  precipitation will be classified into a few categories to be studied.\n\nData requirement\n    Daily and monthly precipitation outputs for all the models are needed.\n\nReferences\nAdler, R.

Because the spatial structure of ENSO varies between models, ENSO variability would be quantified by EOF analyses based on low-latitude SST anomalies. Changes between the two intervals would be assessed for ENSO (i) amplitude; (ii) frequency content; (iii) spatial pattern, based on EOF of low-latitude SST and regressions of PCP and PMSL indexed against the principal component time series of this EOF; teleconnections would be quantified by global regression patterns of SST/GT, PCP and PMSL at various lags; (iv) changes in ENSO-related ocean dynamics such as subtropical cell transport of mass and heat towards the equator. Because there is intrinsic multidecadal variability in ENSO that may be difficult to separate from effects of warming, ensembles of warming runs should be considered where possible, and statistical measures of significance applied to the results.  As behavior is likely to differ between models, for IPCC purposes the main results will consist of \"consensus\" assessments of whether the severity and frequency of ENSO variations and the teleconnection patterns are likely to change, and in what manner. Possibly of interest also are differences in the severity of the \"worst\" El Ninos within the two 50-year intervals, including and not including ENSO-like changes in the mean climate.\n\nData: monthly timeseries of gridded fields of SST, PCP, PMSL, wind stress, 500mb height; monthly (or annual) 3-D fields of T, S, v for upper tropical Pacific Ocean.\n\nReference:\nMerryfield and Boer, 2004: Variability of Upper Pacific Ocean Overturning in a coupled climate model, submitted to Journal of Climate.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic aerosols cool the troposphere and the Earth\u2019s surface reflecting solar radiation and warms the lower stratosphere by absorption of thermal IR and solar near-IR radiation.  Together with the direct radiative effect, volcanic forcing affects circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere shifting the Arctic Oscillation (AO) toward a positive phase.  The duration of the forcing for each particular eruption is about 2 years.  We propose to evaluate how the IPCC models simulate global and regional volcanic impacts on climate during historic period since 1860 to 2000.\n\nThe global average cooling of the climate system caused by volcanic aerosol is statistically stable however both observed and simulated responses have to be cleaned from ENSO to make fair comparison.  The regional responses to individual (even strongest) eruptions , both caused by radiative cooling and change of circulation, are very difficult to evaluate because the observed signal is contaminated by climate variability.\n\nTherefore in this study we propose to conduct a composite analysis of 12 strongest volcanic eruptions since 1860 to 2000 discussed in [Robock and Mao, 1992].  We combine these eruption in the 3 groups because different type of eruptions caused different climate effects:\n1. Equatorial eruption that produced volcanic cloud in both hemispheres \u2013 6 eruptions\n2. SH eruptions that produced plume in the SH \u2013 3 eruptions\n3. High-latitude NH eruptions with plume in the NH \u2013 3 eruptions\n\nFor all models we will analyze summer and winter responses for 2 years following the volcanic eruptions and compare results with corresponding composites from observations.  The different ENSO phase in simulations and observations could negatively affect comparison but a composite averaging should diminish this effect.  The composite analysis will provide more reliable evaluation with observations than analysis of the individual cases.  We will analyze surface air temperature, sea level pressure, 50 hPa geopotential height, and temperature at 50 hPa.  Only surface air temperature could be evaluated with observations from the Climatic Research Unit for entire period since 1860 to 2000.  The other parameters will be evaluated using reanalysis data for 40 years that include strong eruptions of Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo.\n\nIn addition to the analysis of the seasonal fields we will calculate anomalies of global temperature and radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere.  We will remove ENSO signal from global means and compare simulated responses with observations.  Global surface air temperature will be evaluated for entire period of historic run, but radiative fluxes could be compared with observations for about 20 years when ERBE data are available.",

The robustness and uncertainty of the simulated changes will be evaluated by intercomparing results across the ensemble of different model simulations, possibly within the framework of ensemble analysis methods such as the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) method of Giorgi and Mearns (2002, 2003).",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclone (TC) activity is typically defined as the number of significant cyclones (wind speeds &#8805; 34 kt or15 m/s) that form over the tropical oceans on an annual basis. While TC activity has been well observed in the satellite era (1970s to present), counting and characterization of cyclones in climate model solutions is more difficult due mainly to coarse spatial resolution of the models. An alternative to direct measurements is to use an index based on atmospheric parameters that have strong observational and physical linkages to TC formation.\n\nOne such index is the \u201cseasonal genesis parameter\u201d proposed by Gray (1979) and refined by Royer et al. (1998). This index has two factors, one accounting for the dynamical controls of vertical wind shear and low-level vorticity, and the other the thermodynamic source of TC energy including upper-layer ocean heat content, mid-tropospheric moisture and low-level moist static energy. The innovation of Royer et al. was to use model convective precipitation for the thermodynamic factor and to scale the convective precipitation so as to produce current-climate (observed) TC activity. Thus, the Royer-style index can measure slow changes in TC activity if we assume that the physics of the relationship between the dynamical/thermodynamic controls\u2013TC activity varies at a much slower rate than the climate temporal scales of interest. For interannual, decadal variations and century-scale trends it seems unlikely that underlying physics would change so that if over-ocean tropical convection increased in a warmer climate, then TC activity would increase if the dynamical parameters remained constant.\n\nTC activity in the IPCC AR4 coupled model simulations will be analyzed using the Royer scheme for three scenarios: 1) present climate control (pdcntrl); 2) climate of the 20th century (20c3m); and 3) 1%/year CO2 increase to doubling (1pctto2x). TC activity will first be analyzed using the mean annual cycle of a 30-y period for the control and the current climate to determine the convective precipitation scale factor. We will also use total precipitation and the ratio of convective/total precipitation from reanalysis to determine sensitivity to the thermodynamic part of the index. The second phase will consider climate variations in the index, specifically interannual, decadal and century trends using filters.\n\nThe date requirements are relatively modest: 1) monthly means; 2) atmospheric variables of 850 and 200 hPa winds (ua,va; dynamics), convective and/or total precipitation (prc and pr; thermodynamics). The Royer scheme has been implemented and tested for the NCEP R1 & R2 and the ECMWF ERA-40 reanalyses.\n\nReferences:\nGray W.M., 1979: \u2018Hurricanes: their formation, structure and likely role in the tropical circulation\u2019 in Shaw.

            "abstract": "Some studies related with recent global warming issues pointed out a general drying of the mid-continental areas during summer. This is ascribed to a combination of increased temperature and potential evaporation that is not balanced by increases of precipitation. However, in most cases, precipitation over adjacent mountainous regions is more important for the hydrological condition of the arid/semi-arid regions than that falls to the arid/semi-arid regions. Therefore I am investigating the impact of global warming to the local hydrological condition of the northern part of China and Turkey, the two contrastive semi-arid regions in the mid-continental areas of the Eurasian continent. I have already collected more than 1000 stations of precipitation data over northern part of China and that of more than 300 stations for Turkey. Using these data with satellite information and ERA40 dataset, I am developing a statistical downscaling method in order to apply it to the GCM outputs of the SRES scenario runs. During the process, first we are making daily grid precipitation data with including orographic effect for China for 40 years (Xie, Ming and Yatagai, 2003,http://www.chikyu.ac.jp/yris/newsletters.html). Comparison of precipitation of GCM control runs with this kind of quantified gridded precipitation data should be important to assess the performance of GCMS for the semi-arid regions environment. Then apply statistical relationship between atmospheric circulation, especially for moisture transport, and precipitation over the mountains adjacent to the arid/semi-arid regions of Eurasia. Finally, I compare the hydrological budget (precipitation, evapotranspiration, etc) for the regions. Now I request to use GCM outputs of the scenario (100 years of A2 and B2 scenarios) with control runs, and apply the method to the outputs. It should be useful to compare the performance of the models to assess the impact of the global warming over arid/semi-arid regions. \n",

However, a key issue in quantifying the precipitation trends is a full characterization of empirical probability distribution of precipitation. Analysis of observations indicate that gross measures, such as linear trends, often mask the underlying nature of distributional changes. Consequently, similar and/or disparate trends in the upper and lower tails of the precipitation distribution, that may have origins in the natural and/or anthropogenic forcing of the climate are not well quantified and understood. In this project, the focus is on developing analysis methodologies that provide robust estimates of the distributional changes in the global precipitation, at the same time diagnosing the potential role of oceanic temperatures, secular trends, and regional precipitation trends stemming from coupled ocean-atmospheric processes on interannual and longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "A focus of my recent research activities is to integrate complementary information preserved in different data sources for a more complete picture of climate change over the past five centuries. The role I would like to play in the collaboration with climate modelers is to compare proxy climate reconstructions and climate models for the purpose of inter-validation and calibration. On one hand climate modeling can be used to evaluate a climate reconstruction. On the other hand, a reconstructed temperature history and the empirical estimates of the climate response to external forcing terms can be used to tune climate models. In my most recent paper (Huang, 2004, GRL, 31, doi:10.1029/2004GL019781) I merge the long-term information preserved in the global database of borehole temperatures (Huang et al., 2000, Nature, 403, 756-758), the 20th century meteorological record (Jones et al., 1999, Rev. Geophys. 37, 173-199), and an annually resolved multi proxy model (Mann et al., 1999, GRL, 26, 759-62) for an integrated reconstruction of the Northern Hemisphere temperature change over the past five centuries. The integrated reconstruction suggests that the 20th century warming is a continuation of a long-term warming started before industrialization. However, the warming has been substantially accelerated since the onset of industrialization. The integration of the three bodies of information greatly improves the relationship between the reconstructed temperatures and the radiative forcing history. The good agreement between the integrated reconstruction and the forcing model confirms that there are both natural and anthropogenic factors in the recent warming. It also allows for an independent estimate of the rate of climate-forcing response. Analysis of the reconstructed temperature and radiative forcing series offers an estimate of the transient climate-forcing response rate of 0.4 - 0.7 K per Wm-2.",

            "abstract": "I would like to compare the volcanic and solar signal in the IPCC experiments as they get available later this year. First, temporal structures of hemispheric/global response are a first order estimate of natural climate change, particularly if ensembles of 3 or more are available. Our wavelet extraction should be able to pick up the 11-, 22- and ~85-year signals resulting from most solar forcing series. The volcanic signatures will be much easier, but our automatic state-space model will quantify the climate response and deliver posterior probabilities. Second, spatio-temporal signal extraction and response of internal modes to the forcings will be another focus point. This will help to build a quantitative base for studies that 'recognize' a 'clear' solar signal in observed time series across the world, and thus contribute strongly towards a more solid reference for the role of natural forcing during the 20th century. I expect that we will recognize how this role changes over the course of the century. \n\nFundamentally, this work is crucial for the paleo chapter: as a calibration for the (few) transient simulations that have been run for pre-industrial conditions (NCAR, MPI, HadCenter, LMD,...). It will be a very strong message against the random criticism of massive underestimation of natural forcings if we can show that the identical approach as used in the 20th century of implementing natural forcings does actually result in acceptable climate under pre-industrial conditions. This way, as I often push for, the famous statement of \"last 50 years\" can be expanded to something more along the lines of \"natural forcings explain well climate prior to large anthropogenic changes of atmospheric composition, but the last (3?) decades of the 20th century can only be explained when anthropogenic forcing is included\".",

Land-atmosphere coupling strength in a range of climate models has been objectively diagnosed in a recent model intercomparison study, the Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE, Koster et al 2004).  The results of GLACE show that coupling strength varies considerably between climate models for a variety of reasons that are not yet fully understood.   The question we would like to address is the following: Does the inherent strength of a particular model's land-atmosphere coupling have a significant impact on it's simulation of climate and climate change?  The large differences in inherent coupling strength amongst current GCMs permits us to indirectly evaluate this by evaluating IPCC GCM climate change simulations in the context of each model's coupling strength.  Six modeling groups participated in both the GLACE and IPCC experiments are are thus available for comparison (CCCma, CSIRO-CC3, GFDL, UKMO, CCSR, NCAR).  These models span the range of coupling strengths determined in the GLACE study.",

The analysis will be conducted by Jonathan Gregory and Rowan Sutton at the Centre for Global Atmospheric Modelling at the University of Readihg, UK.  The initial focus will be on the 1% CO2 integrations and the equilibrium slab experiments.

            "abstract": "The first priority of the proposed intercomparison is to look at the annual cycle of the sea level pressure pattern over the Arctic and sub-Arctic.  Motivation for the SLP comparison comes from Bitz et al. (2002), who found that model biases in geostrophic surface circulation have a profound effect on the distribution of Arctic sea ice.  Holland and Bitz (in press at Climate Dynamics) further showed  that sea ice biases in present-day climate simulations are linked to the extent of polar amplification in global warming simulations.\n\nIn addition to the SLP and surface circulation intercomparison, I plan to use eddy temperature, geopotential height, potential vorticity, and streamfunction to examine the three-dimensional structure of the flow associated with the SLP centers, particularly the Beaufort High.  In reanalysis, the Beaufort High is the surface expression of a deep barotropic high rather than a surface-trapped feature associated with cold lower-tropospheric temperatures.  Simulations of the high will be more credible -- and less sensitive to local surface temperature change -- if they can reproduce this deep vertical structure.\n\nI also plan to look at the dynamical processes which maintain the high-latitude circulation.  In particular, I would like to compare the strength of the synoptic and submonthly fluxes of heat and momentum among the models, and the strength of the diabatic heating.  In CCSM3 I have found that synoptic momentum flux is overestimated by a factor of two or more, and I'm interested in the possibility that this is a common AGCM bias.\n\nModel data required: \n\n* monthly-mean surface and 3-d circulation fields -- SLP, winds, temperature, geopotential height.\n\n* sub-monthly eddy flux statistics (uu, uv, vv, vt, wt).\n\n* total diabatic heating.\n\n* 6-hourly or once-daily horizontal winds and temperature at an upper level, winds and temperature at a lower level, and SLP.",

The analysis I would like to carry out would investigate the extent to which these relationships are realised in coupled GCMs, and therefore the extent to which the probability distributions of sea-surface winds are accurately simulated. As sea-surface winds play a leading role in air/sea fluxes, it is crucial that we investigate and understand the accuracy of their simulation.  The data that would be required would be sea-surface vector winds at the highest possible temporal resolution.",

It is also predicted that the transport of water associated with the current will increase by an amount close to the present-day flow of North Atlantic deep water.  A simple theory, balancing surface Ekman drift and ocean eddy mixing, largely explains these changes as the oceanic response to changing wind stress. A large ensemble of other CGCMs show similar wind stress changes, from which it is inferred that their ACCs are similarly changed.\n\nIn this project we would aim to confirm the last statement by directly analyzing the simulated ACCs from as many models as possible. \n\nData: Three dimensional ocean T, S, U, V and wind stress fields (monthly or annual) are required.\n\nReference:\nFyfe and Saenko, 2004: Human-Induced Change in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Submitted to J.

            "abstract": "This on going study is a part of \"Regional Climate Change Impact Assessment for transportation infrastructure in Manitoba\". Global Circulation Models (GCM) have been used to assess the impacts of greenhouse gases on climate change study for the last three decades. While useful, many studies have highlighted considerable uncertainties due to its coarse spatial resolution over global grids. There are also large precipitation errors which lead to significant problems for local impact studies. A number of studies suggest that climate downscaling using a nested dynamic model will provide further refinement of coarse scale GCM output simulate these local impacts. Here we consider the dynamic downscaling of climate data using the Pennsylvania State University / National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR) mesoscale model, known as MM5. This model allows choices of cumulus parameterization, boundary layer schemes and convection schemes. The model domain consists of a mother domain centered at 54o N and 98o W which covers a large portion of the Canadian prairies with two inner domains at successive downscaled resolutions to 10 Km. To date, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data has been used for initial and boundary conditions to setup the model and run simulations. The model results are compared with ground observation station data and impacts on transportation infrastructure.\n\nNow, to develop climate change scenarios, GCM climate data is required to force the boundary conditions for the next run.",

The variables of primary interest are the surface moisture flux, near-surface air temperature, the katabatic wind regime, and surface pressure. The models to be investigated are the NCAR CCSM-3, the GFDL CM2.0, GFDL CM2.1, and the GISS ModelE. For the control simulations, model evaluation is complicated by the suspect quality of analyzed fields in high southern latitudes and by the profound changes in conditions including large temperature trends and alterations in the annual cycle of atmospheric pressure. Comparisons will be made with available in situ manned and automatic weather station observations and with climatologies derived from the glaciological record.\n\nThe main task will be to characterize the spatial and temporal differences with observations among the various models. In the second part, the main focus will be on quantifying the Antarctic polar amplification in climate models, and in assessing the potential Antarctic contribution to sea level change resulting from changes to the surface moisture flux.",

Models used will likely include HadCM3, PCM and CCSM, although initial analyses will examine output from a range of models to identify those most representative for projected change over the region. Projections of monthly temperature, precipitation and humidity will be statistically downscaled to 1/8o using a gridded climatological and hydrological database of observed climate over the region (Maurer et al., 2002). Projected daily upper-air and land surface conditions will also be used to drive the NCEP regional spectral model in order to produce dynamical simulations of climate change for selected seasons and years over the Northeast, which can then be merged with the statistically downscaled data to produce an integrated picture of high-resolution climate change across the region. The downscaled climate projections will be used to provide input to assessments of regional climate impacts on agriculture and forest ecosystems; marine fisheries and coastal areas; air quality, disease vectors and human health; and water supply and quality.",

The most comprehensive tools for simulating past and future climates influenced by WMGHGs are fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs). Because of the importance of WMGHGs as forcing agents, it is essential that GCMs compute the radiative forcing by these gases as accurately as possible. We present the results of an intercomparison between the forcings computed by GCMs and by benchmark line-by-line (LBL) radiative transfer codes. The comparison is focused on forcing by CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, and the increased H2O expected in warmer climates. The models participating in the intercomparison include representatives from many of the modeling groups participating in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4) and from a number of the principal groups developing LBL codes.  The results indicate that there are still substantial discrepancies between GCMs and LBL models for forcings by CH4, N2O, and CO2. We quantify these differences and discuss the implications for interpreting variations in forcing and response across the multi-model ensemble of GCM simulations assembled for the IPCC AR4.",

We specifically propose to extract from CMIP model runs a) individual high-magnitude wind events and b) indicators of background windfield strength and direction. These regions are sensitive to erosive activity in part due to wind-driven wave activity. Coastal erosion places infrastructure and habitat at risk. Recent trends suggest that increasing wind fetch due to sea-ice margin retreat, as well as lengthening ice-free seasons, act to increase the erosive power of wave activity and the length of time for wave attack to occur. High-magnitude wind events are the most effective agent of coastal change. It is important to determine if these occurrences are likely to change in frequency or intensity into the future. Atkinson, Solomon and Forbes propose to use daily u and v fields to identify trends in average windfield vectors. As well, high-magnitude wind events will be identified using a demonstrated algorithm from wind fields derived from high temporal resolution pressure grids (3-hourly data). \n\nThe objective of this work is to obtain information about future trends in wind forcing, background and extreme, and to then place these results into an erosion context using existing knowledge about coastal response to wind forcing. \n\nThis work will require the following data fields:  \n\n\tDaily-mean 3-d atmosphere data:\neastward_wind \t\t(ua) \nnorthward_wind \t\t(va)\n\n\t3-hourly 2-d atmosphere data:\n\t\tair_pressure_at_sea_level \t(psl)\n",

This results in an annual precipitation deficit over the western United States and a precipitation increase over western Canada and Alaska. While the initial simulations completed were fixed ice and ocean sensitivity experiments, analysis of the fully coupled CCSM3 indicates that the precipitation shift and a strong link to Arctic ice cover are both reproduced in the coupled system. As a final step in validating the robustness of this prediction, I intend to analyze all 1%/year CO2 increase runs that have been completed for the fourth IPCC assessment. I will be looking to see if precipitation patterns over western North America change as Arctic ice cover declines in response to warming climate. The model data I will require are: sea ice area, total precipitation, zonal and meridional wind, and geopotential height at 500mb.",

Some models (eg HADCM3) have shown that the Southern Ocean has a relatively high signal to noise ratio for the detection of decadal and multi-decadal variations of the climate system (Banks and Woods, 2001).  Observational results in the Southern Hemisphere water masses has also shown difference patterns in key water masses such as SAMW, AAIW and CDW (Aoki et al 2005, Bindoff and McDougall, 2000, Wong et al, 2001, Johnson and Orsi 1997) broadly consistent with climate change scenarios. These observed patterns compare well with HadCM3 simulations (Banks and Bindoff, 2003).\n\nSurface freshwater fluxes are expected to increase in future climates over the high latitude Southern Ocean and Antarctica.  These freshwater  fluxes changes will change the current rates of accumulation over Antarctic and also also likely to affect the meridional overturning circulation in Antarctica (Bi et al 2000, Bi et al 2002).  \n\nWe plan to undertake an analysis of the AR4 model runs with a focus on the Southern Hemisphere  oceans, sea-ice and Antarctic Ice Sheet.  We are interested in diagnosing the coherent changes between the control experiments future scenarios of this multi-model data set for:\n\n* variations and changes in water-mass production of key Southern Ocean water masses (SAMW, AAIW, AABW, CDW and NADW) \n\n* variations and changes in the over-turning circulation in the Southern Hemisphere\n\n* variations and changes in the distribution of the  Sea-Ice (its production, thickness variations and composition, eg amount of snow). \n\n* accumulation of ice over the Antarctic continent\n\n* validation and comparison with observed differences of water masses within the ocean for the twentieth century\n\n* and if possible, using offline methods estimates of future scenarios of alkalinity and impacts.",

Then quantify the changes in the variabilities under increased Green House Gas emssion run output dataset (GHG run of CCSR/NIES).  \n\nStudy (Analysis) Items\n\n1) Trends and interannual variabilities of tempeature and hydrometeorological parameters  over the various parts in Asian monsoon region will be studied using the 100 years model output dataset. \n\n2) Temperature changes over the Asian land Mass in the last century will be analysized using observational NCEP dataset and CCSR/NIES Model output dataset. This could elucidate the warming over Eurasian land mass pertaining to global warming and its impact on the Asian summer monsoon.\n\n3) The interannual variability of the Indian monsoon /Asian monsoon will be studied using the model output dataset from the Historical run of CCSR/NIES, particularly relevant to on land-atmosphere-ocean interactions..\n\n4) The changes in the monsoonal pattern in the model will be studies based on some green house gas warming scenario.The trends and the interannual variability of Indian monsoon/Asian monsoon Precipitation using 100 yrs for Green House Gas run (1901-2000) for different regions within Asian monsoon domain (Regional aspects) will be studied in detail. The seasonal mean and standard deviations of rainfall simulated by CCSR/NIES model for Indian region and other regions can be compared with the observational datasets.\n\n5) Some dynamical monsoon indices are useful as proxies of monsoon circulation and rainfall variabilities  in validating the performance of GCMs. Therefore, the model simulated zonal and meridional wind indices for the monsoon season can be compared with the observed wind indices for the same period.",

The melting degree-day metric is a recognized indicator of seasonal energy that has seen widespread use. Circum-polar gridded datasets lend an important perspective and can identify regional variations in hemispheric trends, which can aid studies of atmospheric dynamics.\n\nThe objective of this work is to use the parameters listed in a), b) and c) above to determine linear and spatial trends in melting degree-days and melt season timings and lengths. Results from this work will support broader atmospheric dynamical investigations, help provide insight into model discrepancies, and would provide an important component of research in other disciplines mentioned above.

The purpose of the proposed research is to estimate the impact of the climate change on the river flow for the major rivers (e.g., the Mekong, Ganges and Euphrates) in Asia-monsoon region. The amount of the future river flow is estimated by the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) that calculates the lateral water movement on the global scale in river channels over the continents. The TRIP model requires the daily runoff dataset by the multi-model results for the IPCC. The additional analysis for the mechanism study requires the monthly mean pressure level dataset (e.g., temperature, wind, geopotential height, humidity and surface pressure). To compare the future river runoff with present, the variability of the intensity and frequency of the floods and droughts are estimated.",

These systems play a major role in defining the regional climate of the area and also contribute significantly to the larger-scale general circulation of the atmosphere, through their interaction with the oceans.  They are highly destructive systems both over the ocean or when approaching or making landfall. Changes in their frequency, intensity, duration and tracks therefore are of great importance. So far, there have been few studies of these systems.  However, as a reference for determining trends, the PI recently has completed an extensive study, resulting in a co-authored article describing the climatology developed from past and present climate data, up to 2003 (Buckley, BW and LM Leslie, International J. of Climatology, 2004). The systems are identified in climate simulations using signature parameters such as the magnitudes of 850 hPa winds and vorticity fields, and SLP values of the surface centers relative to specified thresholds.  The data required therefore is daily (or higher frequency if available) mean values of surface and upper level winds and geopotential heights (if available). Weekly SST fields are also desirable.",

The observed NAO is defined using monthly sea-level pressure anomalies over the Atlantic sector from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis. Sea-level pressure from the models is projected onto the observed modes to ensure that a standardized analysis is performed by comparing to a common metric. The principal components obtained from each of the models will be regressed against other variables, including but not limited to, sea-level pressure, surface air temperature, sea-surface temperature, and precipitation to evaluate the space-time variability of the NAO in the models. Additionally, the NAO influence on the extratropical storm tracks will be investigated. The available climate change scenario runs will be analyzed to assess anthropogenically forced perturbations to the NAO in space and time.\n\nFrom a previous analysis of CMIP2+ control integrations we found that the North Atlantic Oscillation was well represented (AchutaRao et al. 2004, An Appraisal of Coupled Climate Models, PCMDI Technical Report, UCRL-TR-202550). The spatial pattern of the large-scale surface air temperature response to the sea-level pressure perturbation over the Atlantic is akin to that observed, with the spatial error indicating the model response is not as strong as observed. This shortcoming was systematic across the models analyzed, and it was suggested that improvement in the extratropical flow will improve this aspect of the NAO response. Our previous analysis of the CMIP2+ models provides a benchmark against which the new IPCC runs can be compared to determine whether the simulation of the NAO has improved during the course of model development.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the ability of six climate models to capture the observed coupling between SST and surface wind stress in the vicinity of strong midlatitude SST fronts. The analysis emphasizes air-sea interactions associated with ocean meanders in the eastward extensions of major western boundary current systems such as the Gulf Stream, Agulhas, and Kuroshio Currents.  Satellite observations of wind stress from the SeaWinds scatterometer on QuikSCAT and sea surface temperatures from AMSR clearly indicate the influence of SST on surface wind stress on scales smaller than about 30 of longitude by 10 of latitude. Spatially high pass filtered SST and wind stress variations are linearly related, with higher SST associated with higher wind stress.  The influence of SST on wind stress is also clearly identifiable in the ECMWF operational forecast model, \nhaving a grid resolution of 0.35 x 0.35 degrees (T511). The coupling coefficient between wind stress and SST, as indicated by the slope of the linear least squares fit, is only half as strong as for satellite observations, however.\n\nThe ability to simulate realistic air-sea interactions is present to varying degrees in the coupled climate models we examine. The MIROC 3-2-HIRES (1.1 x 1.1, T106) and the NCAR CCSM3.0 (1.4 x 1.4, T85) are the highest resolution models considered and produce the most realistic air-sea coupling associated with midlatitude current systems. Coupling coefficients between SST and wind stress in the MIROC3-2-HIRES and NCAR models are at least comparable to those in the ECMWF operational model. The spatial scales of midlatitude SST variations and SST-induced wind perturbations in the MIROC 3-2-HIRES model are comparable to those of satellite observations. The spatial scales of SST variability in the NCAR model are larger than those in the ECMWF model and satellite observations, and hence the spatial scales of SST-induced perturbations in the wind fields are larger.\n\nWe find that the ability of climate models to simulate air-sea interactions degrades with decreasing grid resolution.  SST anomalies in the GFDL CM2.0 (2.0 x 2.5), UKMO HadCM3 (2.5 x 3.8), and MIROC 3-2-MEDRES (2.8 x 2.8, T42) models have larger spatial scales and are more geographically confined than in the higher resolution models. The GISS Model E-R (4.0 x 5.0) is unable to resolve the midlatitude ocean eddies that produce prominent air-sea interaction.  Notably, the MIROC 3-2-MEDRES model exhibits much weaker coupling between wind stress and SST than the higher vertical and horizontal resolution version of the same model. The GFDL CM2.0 and UKMO HadCM3 models exhibit a linear relationship between SST and wind stress. However, coupling coefficients for the UKMO model are significantly weaker than in the GFDL and higher resolution models. In addition to model grid resolution (both vertical and horizontal), deficiencies in the parameterization of boundary layer processes may be responsible for some of these differences in air-sea coupling between models and observations.",

This time series provides narrower estimates of the rate of sea-level rise as well as the first observational estimate of its regional distribution.  We expect to complete an extension of this time series back to close to 1900 (and before if possible) and up to as close as possible to present day by the end of 2004.  We are also working on new estimates of ocean heat uptake for the period 1950 to 2000 using the same techniques in an attempt to overcome the deficiencies of the Levitus et al. (2000) estimate (Gregory et al., 2004).  The objective of this proposal is to compare these 20th century observed time series with the IPCC model results (sea-level rise and ocean heat uptake) to test their ability to reproduce the observations.  The model sea-level rise would be a combination of ocean thermal expansion and changes in glaciers calculated by standard procedures.  On the longer time scale (probably beyond March/May 2005) we would also compare the regional distributions of sea-level rise in the models with the observational estimates.  While the focus is on testing models of the 20th century, the results have implications for the projections and thus we would anticipate examining a subset of the projections, beyond the AR4 March/May 2005 timeline.  \n\nChurch, J.A.

The strong coupling of the atmosphere and the ocean, in concert with the interplay of a large number of physical processes associated with clouds, radiation and the hydrological cycle suggests that the region is tough test for models. The database of new and improved IPCC models presents and opportunity to progress in our understanding and prediction of tropical Pacific climate change.\n\nWe propose the steps below in analysing changes in mean climate and variability. Noting the severe limitations on time, we are intentionally modest in our aspirations and plans. We have assembled a focused group of researchers who are both experienced in their examination of the output of climate models and who are enthusiastic and are likely to be able to devote considerable effort to the analysis.\n\n* Analysis of changes in mean climate in the tropical Pacific: A simple examination of seasonal changes in SST, sub-surface ocean temperature change, SAT, precipitation, MSLP and surface winds will be performed. The study will use 20-30 year averages taken from the 1% and scenario experiments differenced with the control. Care will be taken to assess statistical significance based on inter-decadal variability estimated from the control runs. Should time allow, mechanisms for changes will be examined. [Jo]\n\n* Analysis of changes in the amplitude and frequency of ENSO variability: Simple indices of ENSO variability will be extracted (NINO3, NINO3.4, NINO4, SOI etc.). Changes will be assessed by examining time series and using simple measures such as standard deviations, standard deviations partitioned by season to look a phase locking to the annual cycle and power spectra. Extended stabilisation scenarios and long control experiments will be used to assess statistical significance. Composite analysis of individual events will be performed if time allows. [Mat]\n\n* Analysis of changes in the spatial structure of the seasonal cycle and ENSO variability: Changes in the spatial structure of the seasonal cycle of ENSO events will be examined using a combination of EOF and composite analysis.  In the first instance, those variables examined in item 1 will be used but further variables will be examined if time allows. A particular focus will be on changes in ENSO teleconnections which are related to impacts.

            "abstract": "Probabilistic methods have recently been proposed as a way of formally quantifying uncertainty in model predictions of climate change (e.g. Murphy et al., 2004; Tebaldi et al, 2004). Ensembles of model projections are gathered (the multi-model \u201censemble of opportunity\u201d) or designed (the \u201cperturbed physics ensemble\u201d) and individual ensemble members are given different weights according to some measure of their credibility or reliability. The ensemble members and their relative weights are then combined to produce a probability density function (PDF) of future climate change (here we use the term PDF as an umbrella term for quantities such as the frequency histogram, cumulative density function etc.). Results may be displayed graphically or, as is common, quoted in terms of an average measure together with a 5-95% uncertainty range.\n\nPDFs are thought to be useful to both policy makers and scientists but care must be taken in their production and interpretation. No method exists which can quantify all the uncertainties in climate change predictions (models, scenarios, unrepresented feedbacks etc.) hence it must be made clear what uncertainties are accounted for. Also a number of different methods exist for generating PDFs and results can be sensitive to those choices. The sensitivity to methods, in particular what the PDF is constrained by and what it is conditional upon should be investigated and clearly stated.\n\nSpace has already been set aside in the AR4 for the inclusion of probabilistic measures of global and large-scale regional variables (section 10.6 of chapter 10 and the corresponding section of chapter 11). It is the purpose of this proposal to produce these measures in the limited time available. The following steps will be performed.\n\n* Regions (e.g. those defined by Giorgi and Mearns, 2002), seasons, time periods and variables will be defined for analysis by all researchers via email exchange early in the project. The project will necessarily focus on a small subset of possible combinations. Data will be downloaded to the individual institutions as and when it becomes available.\n\n* Each group will produce their own weighted ensembles for the regions, seasons and time periods specified. The multi-model and perturbed physics ensembles will be (at first) kept separate to facilitate a comparison but may ultimately be combined. The Hadley group will also produce values for the un-weighted ensemble.\n\n* PDFs will be compared using the same measures and graphical representations. Similarities and differences will be discussed via email exchange and at the March workshop.\n\n* Draft figures and the critical commentary will be produced after the meeting with a view to the inclusion in the AR4 and for peer-reviewed publication.\n\nData Required\n\nSeasonal mean fields from control, 20th century forced and scenario integrations for model fields for which good observational datasets exists (see e.g. figure 4 of Murphy et al., 2004).\n\nReferences\n\nGiorgi, F. and L.O.

Comparisons of AR4 and AR3 pdfs show that scatter within the AR3 and AR4 temperature and precipitation ensembles do not noticeably differ by end of the 21st Century, despite the larger size of the AR4 ensemble; precipitation projections for northern California are even more stationary in AR4 than in AR3; and AR4 warmings are generally 0.85\u00baC less than AR3 because of the different models and emissions scenarios used.",

Hydromoteor.).  The specific focus will be comparative regional climate change in the U.S. and southern Africa.  Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) extract typical patterns in the evolution of weather and climate and depict the region of the pattern-space continuum through which they evolve.  They are especially well suited for extracting significant spatial patterns with strong, shifting gradients, as can occur with regional climate, that truncated series of orthogonal modes may distort or miss entirely.  Using long-term observed and simulated climate records for the United States and southern Africa, we will examine monthly climate evolution over the past several decades to discern changes in occurrence frequency, evolution and amplitude of temperature and precipitation patterns.  Quality of simulated climates will be assessed. Also of interest will be episodes or types of behavior emerging toward the end of twentieth century that are distinctly different from earlier in the century.   Climate simulation output will also be used to determine links, if any, between observed trends in temperature and precipitation patterns and future scenarios, as well as to assess contributions to observed change by different forcing factors.  We will use U.S. and southern African data to contrast two differing domains (different hemispheres, differing synoptic controls, and contrasting interannual variability responses to hemispheric scale processes and teleconnections).  The comparative assessments of climate change and attribution collectively will allow stronger statements about the validity of identified changes and trends. \n\nData required:  Time series of monthly average output, preferably precipitation and near-surface temperature.  Ideally, output from GCM simulations that withhold some of the 20th century forcing changes will also be available.  Corresponding observed data is already in-house.",

For temperature, a detection analysis for moderately extreme temperature (occurring once or several times a year) is presently underway, using fingerprints from CGCM2. Presently, we use an index based on percentile exceedances (based on revised observational indices, see Zhang et al., 2004), and additionally the index of the most extreme day of the year (see Hegerl et al., 2004).  We propose to extend  that analysis by using fingerprints of extreme temperature from the IPCC simulations. A multi-model ensemble of simulations of 20th century climate change will provide a  fingerprint of changes in temperature extremes from the late 20th century. Additionally, fingerprints from individual models can be compared. For precipitation extremes, a detection approach using observations is presently not feasible  due to differences in scale between station data observations and model data. Therefore we limit the analysis of precipitation extremes to comparing future changes in extreme rainfall between model simulations, to distinguish where models show consistent changes in mean and extreme rainfall, and where changes are inconsistent between models. This is to be done similar to the comparison in Hegerl et al., (2004). \n\nThis analyses uses similar data as the Kharin et al. project, but focus instead on intermediately extreme events (occurring once or several times per year) rather than on 20-year return values. However, both projects will closely collaborate.\n\nData requirements: Monthly average precipitation, Tmin and Tmax; daily data for these magnitudes from the second half of the 20th century, for rainfall also from 2040-2060.\n\nReferences \nHegerl, G.

The decline has been one of the most dramatic and sustained of anywhere in the world. A research programme examining the drivers of the decline found that the change is likely attributable in large part to greenhouse warming (IOCI 2002). This highlights that the precipitation in this small region might be highly sensitive to the climate changes resulting from increasing greenhouse gases. It would be of great interest to investigate how the drying trend in the southwest of Australia develops under different scenarios for the future.\n\nThe direct precipitation totals from GCMs and reanlyses have traditionally not captured the decline in the southwest of Australia well. Two down-scaling techniques have used larger scale features to more accurately capture the trend (Charles et al. 1999a, Timbal 2004). The rainfall decline is also shown by the decrease in synoptic types associated with wet conditions (Hope 2004). The three techniques will be applied to the daily CMIP output for the 20C3M simulation to determine how well the models simulate the rainfall changes in the recent past. \n\nEarlier studies have found that the present day analogues are adequate for representing the rainfall in a future climate (Charles et al. 1999b). Discovering the rainfall response in a range of future climates will be of advantage to the local water authorities and to the wider scientific community as an example of the local impact of global climate change on a highly sensitive region. \n \nReferences\nCharles, S.P., B.C.

            "abstract": "Karl et al. (1996) developed two indices to quantify observed changes in climate within the contiguous United States, a US Climate Extremes Index (CEI) and a US Greenhouse Climate Response Index (GCRI).  The CEI was based on a combination of climate extreme indicators, while the GCRI was a combination of indicators based on projected changes due to greenhouse climate change.  These indices integrate changes in climate over several different temperature and precipitation measures and are likely to provide early detection of important changes in climate in the United States.  Karl et al. (1996) noted an increasing trend in the CEI in recent decades and a significant positive trend in the GCRI during the 20th century.  However, attribution of these observed changes to specific causes was not possible as they were not directly compared with climate model simulations.  \n\nThis project has been funded by NOAA OGP CCDD to update the observed CEI and GCRI and to compare them with model simulations.  Daily and monthly climate model data for the US region from simulations with several different climate models, including those from NCAR, GFDL, the Hadley Centre and the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis, will be collected and analyzed.  The interannual and decadal variability of the components of the indices from the model data will be compared with those from observations to assess the quality of the model simulations.  Forced climate model simulations of 20th century climate variations will be analyzed.  These will include simulations with changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, and land use (anthropogenic forcing).  The observed changes in the indices will be compared with the forced model simulations to assess the likely causes of the observed changes.\n\nThe analysis will make use of both daily data and monthly mean data for the US region from both control model simulations and forced simulations for the 20th century.

These indices are based on the spatial fingerprint of greenhouse climate change and include the area-mean surface temperature, the land-ocean temperature contrast, the meridional temperature gradient in the Northern Hemisphere, the magnitude of the annual cycle in temperature over land, and the magnitude of the diurnal temperature range over land.  The indices contain information independent of variations in global-mean temperature for unforced climate variations and hence, they are more useful in the attribution of anthropogenic climate change than global mean temperature alone.  These indices have been used in recent studies of global climate variability and change simulated by some climate models used in the IPCC Third Assessment (Braganza et al., 2003, 2004a, b) and have also been used in a recent climate change detection and attribution study for the North American region (Karoly et al., 2003).\n\nThe indices will be calculated for the global domain and for the North American region from observational data for the period 1880-2003 and compared with data from model simulations for this period.  The models to be analysed include simulations from all three US models (NCAR , GFDL and GISS) being made available for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, together with several other international models (HadGEM, CGCM, ECHAM5).  The variability and correlation structure of the indices will be compared between the observations and the models on three different timescales; interannual variability, decadal variability and trends on 50 year and century timescales.

            "abstract": "Most of migration fishes such as Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) and tuna (Thunnus thynnus orientalis) spawn in the tropic and the sub-tropic region where is away from a habitat of adult. Therefore, transport of their larvae which swimming ability is weaker than the current velocities by the ocean circulation in a scale of the North Pacific plays a significant role in an entire life history. Thus the migration fish with the long passive larval stage such as Japanese eel is largely exerted on by the effect of physical dispersion bringing about large early decrease of their population.\n\nIn case of the Japanese eel which is a representative species whose spawning grounds is far away from the nursery grounds, it is thought that some of them having searched more efficient transport processes for survival generate a present migration system adapted to the current system from tens thousands or hundreds thousands years. Thus the roles of currents for the differentiation and the dispersion of species are very significant and the present migration path from the spawning ground to the nursery ground will not change if the currents are steady state. However, oceanic structures including the present currents system not only have fluctuated seasonally/inter-annually but also have been affected by ocean-climate changes such as the El Ni\u00f1o with some years scale and a decadal regime shift. Not only the larval transport paths but also the spawning behavior of the adults has been varied according to these fluctuations of the oceanic structures, which also have caused the fluctuation of fisheries resources. \n\nFisheries resources of Japanese eels, and Atlantic eels, which are a closely related species and habitats in the Atlantic, have decreased since around 1975 when showed a peak of catches. An ocean-climate change with the earth scale known as climate regime shift occurred in 1975. After that, El Ni\u00f1o have happened in the short run term, and on a long term basis the position of salinity front closely related to the spawning behavior of Japanese eel have gradually shifted to the north. Spawning area of Japanese eel is located in the North Equatorial Current west of Mariana Islands as shown in Fig. 1 (Tsukamoto, 1992). They are firstly transported from the North Equatorial Current (NEC) region and then to the coast of Japan by the Kuroshio from near the Luzon Strait (Fig. 1) (Kimura et al., 1994). The positions of salinity front, considered as an indicator of spawning behavior of Japanese eel, due to the NEC are affected by the occurrence of the El Nino events (Kimura et al., 2001), and the fluctuation of the NEC dominates the success and failure of larval transport.\n \nTherefore, Firstly, we have to understand the generation properties of Ocean-Climate changes in the Pacific and the Atlantic using several statistics data, and then getting hold of the changes of oceanic structures in the two oceans when these ocean-climate changes, particular El Ni\u00f1o and non- El Ni\u00f1o events. the output from the IPCC simulations is thought to provide us with many imformations of climate changes in the scale of the Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Climate varies on multi-decadal time scales, in many instances due solely to the strong nonlinear dynamics of coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions.  The suggestion for a climate trend can be easily rendered when examining only a portion of such low frequency swings, when in fact no drift is occurring. A new attribution challenge exists in today\u2019s climate system however, where atmospheric chemistry is known to be changing due to human activity, and true climate trends are anticipated.   On regional scales, differentiating the intrinsic low frequency variations from ones that are forced is a key to knowing whether climate is indeed veering toward a new direction.  Beyond the policy-relevance of such knowledge, and its societal value, there also exist immediate consequences for operational long-lead climate predictions. The practice of seasonal climate prediction at the Climate Prediction Center includes utilization of US trends (generally the past 30-years) in surface temperature and precipitation through a method referred to as Optimal Climate Normal. The skill of seasonal predictions of US surface temperature, based on trend information alone, have proven comparable to predictors that have characteristic interannual variability, such as ENSO.  Despite the success of observed climate trend information in seasonal predictions, understanding the causes for such variability from the observed data alone remains poor. Are such trends merely part of atmospheric internal variability, or can the trends be attributed to an external forcing?  To the extent that a forcing has been important, is it manifest as the direct and local response to increasing greenhouse gases, or are the non-local feedbacks associated with the ocean\u2019s response to increasing greenhouse gases also important?   A more complete understanding can be gained from the analysis of model simulations for the 20th century where the climate, including its low frequency statistical fluctuations is compared with similar runs where the observed evolution of external forcing is specified.  Analysis for simulations from more than one model is also essential to gain confidence in validity of conclusions.  The focus of this proposal, therefore, will be analysis of differences in atmospheric trends between control simulations and 20th century simulations to year 2000, and to analyze their relationships with the observed trends.\n\nData Sets Required:  Analysis will rely on monthly mean fields from three sets of simulations:  (1) 100 year (minimum) control run, and (2) 20th century AMIP simulations to year 2000 forced with observed SSTs and observed climate forcing, and (3) 20th century coupled simulations with observed climate forcing.  Our main focus will be on the analysis of monthly mean upper level heights, land surface temperature, and precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Project overview\nThe objectives of the project are (i) to better understand the dynamics of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region, (ii) to define the influence of the stratosphere on the structure of these variability modes, (iii) to analyse in detail the ability of coupled OAGCMs to reproduce these atmospheric variability modes and their sensitivity to external forcing, and (iv) to begin to investigate possible causes of multidecadal regime transitions of tropospheric teleconnectivity. \n\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant atmospheric variability mode in the North Atlantic Region. It has a large impact on the weather and climate of the North Atlantic ocean and the surrounding landmasses by influencing temperature, wind and precipitation patterns (e.g. Hurrell, 1995), and as such controls drought or flood conditions, the trajectory and strength of storms, and heat waves and cold spells, especially over Europe. It additionally interacts with the ocean and may influence the Thermohaline Circulation (THC) in the North Atlantic (Hurrel et al., 2003) as well as the position of the Gulf Stream. NAO has a life cycle of approximately two weeks and is driven by the interaction of baroclinic synoptic and planetary waves (Feldstein, 2003). Several studies (e. g. Baldwin and Dunkerton, 2001) show that the polarity of the NAO index in winter depends on the state of the stratospheric polar vortex. Wind anomalies associated with the strength of the polar vortex extend to the upper troposphere (Christiansen, 2003). Upper tropospheric wind shear influences the preferred area of growth of baroclinic eddies and, therefore, of storm tracks. Hence, changes in polar vortex regimes over time will lead to changes in the variability structure of the NAO (Perlwitz et al., 2000). Walter and Graf (2005) made clear that these structural changes are due to shifts in the weights of contributing dynamical processes in the atmosphere and that the changes involve storm tracks and precipitation and their correlation with the NAO index. Potentially this will also involve changes in the effectiveness and patterns of ocean-atmosphere interaction on a basin wide scale (Graf and Walter, 2005).\n\nIt is therefore of crucial importance for the scientific community to be able to predict the short- and long-term variability of the NAO. However, the Earth's atmosphere and oceans constitute a coupled system with a large number of interactions and feedbacks. The underlying processes are portrayed with different accuracy and weight in different atmospheric, oceanic and coupled circulation models that would allow for the prediction of future climate conditions. This leads to differences in the forecasts of ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (OAGCMs) for an increasing greenhouse gas burden. Many of these differences may be related to differences in the atmospheric part of the coupled models, others may be due to biases at the interface between atmosphere and ocean. Very recently, Osborn (2004) showed that the current coupled OAGCMs exhibit only weak similarity with observed NAO/AO patterns. Only if the mean of the models' first EOFs is computed, a structure similar to the observed NAO evolves. However, the amplitudes then are much smaller than observed. Reasons for this unsatisfying behaviour remain unknown.\n\nWith this project I propose to study in detail the ability of coupled OAGCMs to reproduce the dynamics of atmospheric internal variability structures and their sensitivities to external forcing (e.g. Increasing GHG burden or volcanic eruptions). By investigating the mechanisms behind the dominant atmospheric variability mode in the North Atlantic area (the NAO) both in observations (reanalysis data for the years 1958-2003) and in models (control runs and GHG forced runs from CMIP, see http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip) I want to uncover basic controlling processes for ocean-atmosphere coupling and their changing weight in the past and future. By comparison of these processes between the \"real world\" and the \"model world(s)\" I shall\nbe able to assess the level of trustworthiness of different OAGCMs and their potential to forecast future climates. At the same time I may be able to interpret the causes of failure of some of the models to reproduce the observed past. I finally will investigate processes that lead to transitions of regimes of the stratospheric polar vortex on a seasonal to (multi)decadal time scale, which might have contributed to (multi) decadal variability in the efficiency of ocean atmosphere coupling and teleconnectivity.\n\nMethodology/work plan\nThe project is broken into 3 work packages. Atmospheric data consisting of approximately four decades of daily 3-D grid values of geopotential heights, wind vectors, temperatures etc. will be obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Centre (ERA40) and from the NOAA web page (NCEP reanalysis). Analysis tools will be developed with these data and can then be applied to the model data. I will study in detail the ability of coupled OAGCMs from CMIP as well as the Hamburg ECHAM5 model to reproduce the dynamics of internal patterns of variability and their sensitivities to external forcing. Since differences in the probability density functions of the index time series of the fundamental atmospheric variability modes (between different models and between models and reanalysis data) can be expected, I will document these and derive respective wind stress fields, freshwater and heat fluxes. All investigations will be based on daily data, if necessary after application of numerical filters. I will start with reanalysis data and apply the developed methodology therein to model data as these are received. Finally I will investigate if I can detect regimes of variability of the polar vortex strength (Feser et al., 2000) in the control runs of the coupled models considered, and study the cause of transitions between different multi-decadal regimes and their impact on global teleconnections (Walter and Graf, 2002).\n\n1st year:\nAcquire reanalysis data, develop of dynamic analysis tools, analyse polar vortex regimes, define new NAOlike indices, analyse time series (reanalysis data)\n\n2nd year:\nDetermine mechanisms of build-up and decay of NAO-like variability in reanalysis data for different stratospheric regimes (reanalysis data)\nAnalyse polar vortex regimes, define new NAO-like indices, and produce associated patterns, time series analysis of model data, start to search for causes of stratospheric regime transitions (intra-seasonal) and forced by GHG in reanalysis and model data (model data)\n\n3rd year:\nDetermine mechanisms of build-up and decay of NAO-like variability in models, model-model and modelreanalysis intercomparison (model data) Study mechanisms of global/regional regime transitions (multi-decadal) in control and GHG forced model run (model data)\n\nLiterature\nBaldwin, M.P., and T.J.

With the aim of determining the implication of the tropospheric response to climate change for stratospheric dynamics, it is proposed to analyze selected IPCC simulations for selected time periods. At first, the characterization of the model response will be done by means of zonal means of basic fields as temperature and zonal wind, for appropriate time averages.

PV and PT of air particle are slowly transformed only due to the influence of irreversible factors  (diabatic influxes of heat and friction). Consequently,  some functionals based on adiabatic invariants may be considered as useful indices of climatic changes. The following two functionals are  proposed in investigation of the climate variability in Northern and Southern Hepisphere: .the  first functional is  the air mass distribution on PV and PT values which gives direct insight on the changes of vortex and thermal statement of atmosphere; the second functional  follows from  fundamental freedom existing in Ertel's general definition of PV. It gives the possibility to introduce a novel invariant measure q which is an \"optimal\" modified PV in definition of which enters a monotonic increasing function r of potential temperature. This measure is preserved in idealized climate processes, when external diabatic heating and frictional forcing, being applied to zonally-oriented infinitely thin (q,r)-tubes (formed at the expense of intersection between iso-scalar surfaces q=const and r=const), annihilate each other. A reference stationary air mass distribution on (q, r)-values, introduced for both hemispheres separately, does not depend on r.

Traditionally, observational confirmation of such dynamics has been somewhat elusive, mainly to the nonlinearity in the response functions and scaling and the narrower meridional extent, the more intense trades and the resulting shorter fundamental periods in the ENSO pattern reproduced by most customary CGCM.\n\nOur specific objectives will be: \n1) Check with local analysis tools how the different GCM reproduce ENSO in the Pacific, \n2) Track which are their local atmospheric field manifestations and how this can be traced to both atmospheric and oceanic signatures in distant basins (mainly for the NAE region and the Mediterranean area in particular, and for the Indian Ocean (IO) domain), and \n3) on the basis of the best models for 1) and 2), undergo the study of climate changes at the interannual timescale under 21st century conditions (2CO2 essentially).\n\nWe will mainly concentrate on the interannual response of coupled models in the 20th century and use innovative analysis and diagnostic tools recently developed to study the transitory response at these timescales. Of those models selected for their best response, we will study which teleconnection patterns they generate and how these change or not in the spatial extent and/or magnitude for the 21st century simulations.\n\nModels scrutinized that do not produce a reasonable ENSO simulation should be objectively excluded from a multi-model ensemble forecast of future climate change. We will then assess the skill of each model and use it to generate forecasts of future ENSO teleconnections. Our objective would be to determine if an improved hindcast for the Mediterranean region in S. Europe and over the Indian subcontinent could be generated from GCM simulations, and then to apply the same process to precipitation forecasts in future climate change simulations. Our interest in the Indian Ocean and continental India climate under 2CO2 conditions lies in the possibility of forecasting future cholera outbreaks in that region.\n\nData needed would essentially be precipitation, sea surface temperature and surface air temperature, sea level pressure and geopotential height anomalies at different levels, and if possible wind fields and soil moisture.\nThis research will be mainly conducted by Prof. Xavier Rod\u00f3, with the involvement of at least  Drs.

We propose to investigate the 20th Century representation of the NAO in the control run relative to observations, and during the 21st Century where model output for several scenarios will be contrasted with the control run.  From the 1970s until recently the NAO trend has been upward and this has been accompanied by an intensified mean Icelandic Low that is displaced unusually farther northeast during the cold season in years with strong Atlantic westerlies.  Little evidence of change appears to occur in negative phase years.  The resulting NAO 20th century modes might be characterized by normal positive and negative phases and a more recent hyper-positive phase with centers displaced closer to Europe and possibly forced by the Indian Ocean.  Evaluations of these characteristics in the control run will be made and the potential role of NAO phase and intensity changes in the future will be evaluated in light of the hydroclimate of Europe.  Precipitation receipt, and associated data (e.g. cloudiness, precipitable water, u- and v-wind components, runoff, and soil moisture) will be evaluated in similar manner.  The changing frequency of extreme precipitation events will also be investigated on monthly and seasonal-mean timescales, including evaluation of changes in intensity and frequency of drought.  The role of potential precipitation changes in the 21st century on stream flow in alpine regions, especially southern Europe which is particularly affected by wet negative-phase conditions, will be evaluated.\n\nREQUIRED DATA:\n1)  20th Century simulation to year 2000, then fix all concentrations at\nyear 2000 values and run to 2100.\n2)  21st Century simulation with SRES A1B to 2100, then fix all\nconcentrations at year 2100 values to 2200.\n3)  21st Century simulation with SRES B1 to 2100, then fix all\nconcentrations at year 2100 values to 2200.\n4)  21st Century simulation with SRES A2 to 2100.\n5).  1% CO2 run to quadrupling with an additional 150 years with CO2\nfixed at 4x.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant pattern of variability on timescales from days to decades in the Atlantic region of the Northern Hemisphere and climate change patterns project positively onto the NAO.  Despite this, estimates of the NAO response to anthropogenic forcing are poorly constrained.  Similarly, the magnitude and nature of internal variability in the NAO and the role of coupling with the ocean and the stratosphere are only just beginning to be understood.  We therefore propose the following analysis to reduce some of these uncertainties for the IPCC AR4 and to reach the latest consensus using current models.\n\na)  Climate change and climate variability in the NAO.  Timeseries of gridpoint and pattern based measures of the NAO will be used to determine a multi-model mean response of the NAO to anthropogenic climate forcing and its effect on surface temperature.  Uncertainty in the expected NAO changes due to model formulation and internal variability will be assessed, and any changes in NAO structure will be examined.  Comparison will also be made with recent observed NAO changes.\n\nb) The link between changes in the NAO and eddy statistics. The IPCC Beijing workshop concluded that intercomparison of mid-latitude cyclones in models was difficult because different tracking methods have been used.  Here we will apply a single mid-latitude storm tracking routine to data from each model to analyse changes in frequency, intensity and life-times of mid-latitude storms.  A model inter-comparison of changes in storms will also be carried out and the changes in storms will be linked to changes in the NAO.\n\nc) The role of boundary conditions. There is current debate about the role of lower and upper boundary conditions on the NAO from the sea-surface and the stratosphere.  We will carry out a preliminary search for links between these boundary conditions and changes in the modelled NAO.\n\nTo carry out this analysis we require monthly-mean sea level pressure fields, monthly mean land and sea-surface temperature fields, high frequency sea-level pressure fields (12 hour intervals or higher frequency), monthly mean lower stratospheric zonal winds.

We have verified the capabilities of the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model for simulating annual and interannual variability in stream flow in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) for the late 20th century and demonstrated that a future scenario climate gives stream flow significantly different from contemporary climates (Jha et al., 2004).  Stream flow is an integrator of many hydrological processes including precipitation, snowmelt, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture changes and as such presents a challenging variable for evaluating GCM performance over mid-continental areas.  SWAT requires input values of daily maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and precipitation.  SWAT will create daily values by use of its internal weather generator operating on GCM monthly values or it will take GCM daily values directly if such are available.  The domain will be the central US.  Personnel involved include Phil Gassman, Manoj Jha, and Eugene Takle of Iowa State University.",

A useful method to test this aspect of GCM performance is to estimate the models' long-range temporal correlation exponents (Govindan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 2002) of surface temperature and other fields, and to compare these to estimates for the observations. Recently we performed this kind of analysis on several NCAR PCM simulations that used various anthropogenic and natural forcings over the past century. We found that the long-range temporal correlations were sensitive to the types of forcings included, and in particular that it is necessary to include volcanic forcing to reproduce the observed correlations (Vyushin et al., Geophys. Res. Lett. 31, 2004). \n\nWe propose to use the opportunity of the release of the IPCC datasets to 1) apply robust methods of estimating long-range correlation exponents to several models and 2) apply these methods globally rather than at individual sites as has been done in the cited references. The objective of the analysis is to infer the influence of different forcings and of internal variability on long-range correlations, with reference to the observations.",

How the frequency and intensity of active (break) spells will change in the changing climate of 21st Century is of concern for a vast Indian population. We propose to use composite technique, after first identifying \"active\" and \"break\" periods in the monsoon, to study the possible changes in periodicity, strength and spatial structure of these phases under different climate change scenarios. How the changes in intra-seasonal oscillations (ISO) are contributing to the possible changes, if any, of active(break) epochs, will also be studied.

Then quantify the changes in the variabilities under increased Green House Gas emssion run output dataset (GHG run of CCSR/NIES).  \n\nStudy (Analysis) Items\n\n1) Trends and interannual variabilities of tempeature and hydrometeorological parameters  over the various parts in Asian monsoon region will be studied using the 100 years model output dataset. \n\n2) Temperature changes over the Asian land Mass in the last century will be analysized using observational NCEP dataset and CCSR/NIES Model output dataset. This could elucidate the warming over Eurasian land mass pertaining to global warming and its impact on the Asian summer monsoon.\n\n3) The interannual variability of the Indian monsoon /Asian monsoon will be studied using the model output dataset from the Historical run of CCSR/NIES, particularly relevant to on land-atmosphere-ocean interactions..\n\n4) The changes in the monsoonal pattern in the model will be studies based on some green house gas warming scenario.The trends and the interannual variability of Indian monsoon/Asian monsoon Precipitation using 100 yrs for Green House Gas run (1901-2000) for different regions within Asian monsoon domain (Regional aspects) will be studied in detail. The seasonal mean and standard deviations of rainfall simulated by CCSR/NIES model for Indian region and other regions can be compared with the observational datasets.\n\n5) Some dynamical monsoon indices are useful as proxies of monsoon circulation and rainfall variabilities  in validating the performance of GCMs. Therefore, the model simulated zonal and meridional wind indices for the monsoon season can be compared with the observed wind indices for the same period.\n",

Moreover, the detection of precipitation change over the 20th century is still a challenge for both statistical (weak signal to noise ratio) and physical (competing direct and indirect effects of increasing amounts of GHG) reasons. Given the obvious influence of the land surface hydrology on the surface energy budget, one might wonder if the multi-decadal precipitation variations simulated by the IPCC models is not a significant obstacle for the models to capture the land surface warming observed over the 20th century at the regional scale. Our proposal is aimed at exploring the link between precipitation and surface temperature at the seasonal timescale, and at using this relationship to produce new estimates of temperature trends, both in models and observations. The ultimate goal is to check if these \u201ccorrected\u201d trends are less model-dependent and more consistent with the observations.",

            "abstract": "Monthly and 3-hourly precipitation data from 20th century climate simulations by the newest generation of eighteen coupled climate system models are analyzed and compared with available observations. The characteristics examined include mean spatial patterns, seasonal, year-to-year and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and the diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially MRI-CGCM2.3.2a, produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. Most models do not simulate well the distribution of mean total cloud amount including marine stratus clouds, with the HadCM3 and HadGEM1 severely underestimating cloud cover over most of the globe. Most models, especially the GFDL and UKMO models, GISS-AOM and PCM, produce too much convective (over 95% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low-latitudes, in contrast to 45-65% in the TRMM satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to deficiencies in model-simulated ENSO amplitudes: the standard deviation of ENSO SST indices increases with tropical convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm/day), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (>20 mm/day) precipitation and overestimate them for light (<10 mm/day) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm/day category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America has intensity comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm/day) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in the new models, and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of world's coupled climate models.",

Yet little attention has been paid to the response of the eastern pacific and particularly south pacific to anthropogenic climate change. We wish in the following to complete this need by investigating the changes in the heat balance of the oceanic surface layer (air-sea processes and advective terms), at the seasonal time scales which may be influenced by the forcing of greenhouse gases at secular time scales in the eastern pacific with particular emphasis in two areas. The Panama bight and is associated regions which are located north of the equator (9N-1S, 100W-78W) and the Humboldt Current (2S-40S, 90W-east).\n\nObjectives:\nCompare the seasonal cycle for shortwave and longwave radiation, sensible, latent, and net heat fluxes available from four products in order to gain an improved understanding of the characteristic of the Humboldt Current and Panama Bight System spatial patterns, their seasonal structure, and how they evolve forced by greenhouse gases and other forcing under different scenarios.",

Detection and attribution of climate change has primarily been based on the statistical analysis of global scale quantities such as near surface temperatures, satellite based temperature measurements, height of the tropopause, ocean heat content, sea ice extent, length of the growing season, sea level pressure etc. Recently, some studies have investigated the detection and attribution problem over continental scales. Karoly et al. (2003) made a comparison of index trends in observations and model simulations over North America, and they showed that the temperature changes from 1950 to 1999 were unlikely to be due to natural climate variation alone. No previous study has investigated this problem over sub-continental scales, and our work will fill that void and specifically focus on the western US.\n\nOur project will use the data from the pre-industrial control and historical runs of NCAR CCSM3 and other climate models that are submitted to the IPCC data portal. The proposed detection variables are surface air temperature, precipitation, diurnal temperature range, mean magnitude of the annual cycle in surface air temperature, land sea temperature contrast, and snow depth. The pre-industrial control runs will be used to establish the \"natural variability\" of the climate system. We will compare the historical ensemble simulations with control simulations and observations of the climate detection variables. The goal is to determine if we can attribute the historical climate change over the western US to our \"best estimate\" of the historical forcing. It will also investigate if higher resolutions of the climate model, land use change and other local and regional scale forcings such as black carbon are important to detect regional climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Earth is a complex system, composed of a solid elastic inner-core, a liquid core, a solid mantle, and superficial fluid layers (atmosphere, ocean and continental water storage). The models show that the changes induced in the dynamics of the climate system by the anthropogenic increase of the CO2 affects the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the cryosphere (in particular the amount of mass in the polar ice sheet and the sub polar glaciers). Variations of the global circulation and the mass repartition at the Earth's surface induce significant changes to be observed with geodetic techniques. In particular, the gravity field, as measured for instance by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, is directly sensitive to the mass repartition at the Earth surface. The Earth rotation rate is rather sensitive to the global zonal circulation in the atmosphere and in the ocean. The shape of the Earth, as measured by the deformation of global scale network of GPS (and soon Galileo) stations, is also perturbed by the variable mass repartition at the Earth surface.  Those quantities are measured by geodesists with an incredible precision: the variation of the Earth orientation in space, and thus its rotation, are measured at the sub-centimeter level. The geoid, derived from gravity field, is measured at the millimetre level, and a millimetric position can be achieved for the station position. The geodesy can thus be a useful tool to study global scale changes in the climate system. It has several advantages with \"classical\" climatic observation: \n\n(1) it is global, and can thus test the results where only few observational data are available, \n(2) it is very precise, for instance GRACE is able to \"feel\" a 1mm of water anomaly over a few hundred kilometer scales, \n(3) it is independent, as it does not use any of the data that have been, so far, assimilated in atmospheric or climate models. \n\nThis project aims to test what would be the consequences on the geodetic observables of the expected changes in the climate system induced by the CO2 increase, as predicted by the different coupled models. This will allow us to know which observables are different from one model to another, and thus which can be used in order to test the models against the independent geodetic observations.",

The overall topics related to the issue were the climatic changes themselves of major climate variables, such as surface air temperature and precipitation, and their impacts in socio-economic aspect. Among the topics, we pay attention to vegetation distribution resulted from the changes of temperature and precipitation.\n\nObjectives:\nOne of the conclusive remarks obtained through model intercomparison projects such as AMIP and CMIP is that multi-model ensemble result is closer to observation and is more reliable than a single model simulation chosen as the best (WGNE AMIP Panel 2001). On the other hand, there is a meaningful evaluation acknowledged among especially CMIP participating groups. It is that projection of future climate change by climate models (e.g. difference between 1XCO2 and 2XCO2 climates) is more significant than prediction of future climate itself by the models (IPCC 2001). Based on these two points as well-known consensus, we pursue to find out how Koeppen climate classification based upon vegetation distribution is going to change in CO2 doubling period, and to have a profound discussion on the result and its implication. \n\nMethodology:\n1.Get the global map of Koeppen climatic types from CMIP I and II multi-model ensembles\n2.Embed the difference between CMIP I and II ensembles in the observed present climate, and thus obtain a new future Koeppen climatic type map in CO2 doubling period:\nFind the difference (DIFF) of temperature and precipitation between CMIP I and II ensembles\nUse CRU 2.0 dataset for the observed present climate (OBS) from 1971 to 2000\nAdd the DIFF to the OBS and get a future Koeppen climatic type map (OBS CO2) in CO2 doubling period (year 55 to 85 in model integration).\n\nReferences:\nIPCC, 2001: Climate change 2001: Scientific basis.

            "abstract": "Over the past year, we have developed a set of new techniques for assessing hurricane risk in general. The first part of this involved developing a new tropical cyclone genesis index, which predicts the space-time probability of storm formation given monthly mean environmental kinematic and thermodynamic conditions.  This index works very well in the present climate for predicting the spatial, seasonal and interannual variability of storm genesis. Once we calculate this index, we generate a very large number of synthetic storm tracks by first making random draws from the genesis PDFs and then marching the tracks forward assuming that the storms move with a weighted vertical average of the environmental flow plus a constant correction for beta drift. The environmental flow is also synthesized using Fourier time series with random phase, but which have the same monthly means, variances and covariances as the NCEP re-analysis data. Finally, a simple but accurate coupled deterministic hurricane intensity model is run along each track, and output from this is used to assess wind speed probabilities. The statistics of the tracks and the wind speeds compare extremely well with historical hurricane data. Details of this technique are described in an article accepted for publication in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\n\nI would like to extend this technique to predict hurricane activity in future climates by using GCM output to calculate the hurricane potential intensity (needed by the deterministic model), the genesis PDFs, and the monthly means, variances and covariances of global winds to synthesize hurricane tracks. Doing this for a reasonably large set of models will help assess uncertainty. I believe this will produce the first quantitative analysis of hurricane risk in global warming scenarios.",

We are motivated by a relatively new instrument, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), aboard the Aura platform.  Apart from measuring a number of chemical constituents, it also has the ability to estimate profiles of cloud ice.  Satellite-based information, and thus global information, on this quantity have been challenging to obtain. Nadir viewing (IR/visible) instruments have to make a number of assumptions in order to obtain cloud ice retrievals, and over the cold, bright polar surface the problem becomes terribly difficult.  The MLS on the other hand is a limb sounder that can probe deep into the polar atmosphere, and provide contemporaneous profiles of temperature and water vapor as well.  This provides an altogether new resource to examine cloud variability in the polar regions - regions that of course are particularly sensitive to the prospect of global warming. Thus our intent is to utilize this resource to examine how well a sample of GCMs represent polar cloud variability.  Our initial focus will be on the control experiments using monthly data on the total ice amount, as well as related quantities such as precipitation, cloud fraction, temperature and relative humidity.",

We have been working on analyzing the atmospheric data of the CCSM3 model (IPCC 1870-2000 historical run) and have found some biases between the model and the observational data. One example is the strong warm bias in the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern basin, which is, based on our analysis, related to the anomalous equatorial westerly occurring during the spring season, and the anomalous abundant rainfall over the North Africa in spring and summer. These phenomena occurring in the atmospheric model will suppress the coastal upwelling, which can be confirmed by analyzing the oceanic data. In some other study, it is also suggested that the ocean physics is also playing a role in this warm bias in the eastern basin. We would like to find out what mechanism in the ocean physics is wrong. Therefore we need to extend our analysis to the oceanic model data.",

Second, we are interested in assessing predicted changes in snowpack in California. Our research has recently improved the prediction of snowpack by accounting for improved snow aging and aerosols. The IPCC forecasts of mountain snowpack provide a valuable probability envelope of projected snowpack changes with which we can extrapolate our improved forecasts to the future without the expense of re-running multiple climate change simulations.",

            "abstract": "1) Introduction\nThe possibility of future climate change has enormous significance for western water management, particularly for planning and designing infrastructure for future water requirements. Most models suggest substantial warming over much of North America, including the West. Models indicate a likely acceleration of continental warming over the 21st century and an intensification of the hydrological cycle (IPCC 2001). Even without changes in precipitation, such warming would have major implications for western water management. Improved climate-change projections on regional scales are urgently needed for the benefit of those who deal with water resources (Lewis et al. 2003). Predictions of potential climate change are developed through analyses of observed relationships compared with projections by physically based climate models.\n\nProblem: Examine model scenarios of precipitation for the southwest U.S. for late 21st century compared with observational data for the late 20th century.\n\n2) Proposed Data\nStudy area is the southwest U.S. region of Arizona and New Mexico located between 32 N - 37 N, 104.5 W - 114.5 W\na) Observed precipitation data from the Cooperative Station Network of the National Weather Service for the years 1981-2001\nb) Output from 2 IPCC GCMs (e.g. Hadley and Canadian)scenarios for 2061-2081. (check resolution, reasons for selecting)\n\n3)Analysis of observations\nAnalysis of anomalous wet/dry years; seasonal, monthly, and interannual composites of Arizona and New Mexico (AZNM) precipitation for the years 1948 - 2005. The figures are derived by the use of Fortran programs written to produce maps of daily, monthly, annual, climatology, and monsoon season (July-August) precipitation and circulation plots. Anomalous years are sorted into 10 wettest and 10 driest years according to precipitation values. Maps are produced of composite precipitation and wind vectors of 10 wettest/driest Julys, 10 wettest/driest Augusts, 10 wettest/driest months (July or August), and 10 wettest/driest monsoon seasons (July + August) of the data. This has been repeated for the three and five wettest/driest years for comparison to examine the stability of the composites. Individual anomalous years are also plotted and mapped for precipitation and wind vectors. Case study months and years are selected for further analysis. This work is currently in progress.\n\n4) Analysis of GCM control cases and comparison with observations\nControl experiments vs. observational data for precipitation and temperature for selected models\n\n5) Analytic comparison for the periods 1981 - 2001 vs 2061 - 2081\n- Differences in precipitation fields between two GCMs for two scenarios (possibly SRES A1 and SRES B1). \n- Interpretation of projected changes - means, variability.\n- Examine some of IPCC extreme indices\n\n6) Discussion and Regional implications\n\n7) Conclusions/future directions",

A second part of the study aims to investigate the hydrologic impact of climate change in selected watersheds across Canada and the United States. GCM daily simulations will be downscaled and used for hydrologic modeling. The ultimate objective is to assess the frequency and variability of hydrologic extremes (floods and droughts) in the future. Both daily and monthly GCM datasets are needed for this project.  We will likely choose 5 or 6 representative GCMs and use the 20C3M and 21st Century scenario simulations.",

Any systematic change in the frequency of such extreme events could have significant social and economic impacts. Observational studies have suggested that such trends are indeed seen in the occurrence of droughts in certain regions. However, it is difficult to assess the statistical significance of these trends, because nature provides just one realization of the stochastic variability associated with precipitation. In our study, we focus on statistical issues dealing with trends in precipitation.  We pursue a two-pronged approach, using two different definitions of extreme events, one based on extreme value statistical theory, and other based on conventional indices such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index.  We analyze precipitation variability at nine stations spread across the continental United States. To assess statisical significance, we use a Monte Carlo approach using both observational data and simulated data obtained from coupled and uncoupled GCMs. Thus far we have obtained data from the NCAR CCSM3 and PCM integrations. We would like to extend our analysis to include other models from the IPCC suite of integrations.",

Our results show that mean annual temperature in the last two decades of the 20th century has been increasing at a rate of 0.6 deg C/10 yr. This rate of warming is nearly twice the mean rate of warming (0.3 deg.C/10 yr) that calculated for China.  Analysis of seasonal trends also indicate that since the early 1970s summer and winter mean temperatures have increased as well as a general decreasing trend in summer precipitation.  The banning of fire in the alpine, instituted to prevent the accidental burning subalpine forests, and changes in grazing patterns have contributed to the advance of sapling trees and shrubs into alpine meadows.  Clearly, two spatially and temporally distant anthropogenic disturbances, a rapidly warming climate and changes in land use, appear to be affecting alpine glaciers and upper treeline vegetation dynamics, thus threatening both biodiversity and Tibetan livelihoods in the Hengduan Mountains of northwestern Yunnan China.  This work indicates the need for developing land management strategies that will address all critical scales.   \n\nBaker, B.B. and Moseley, R.K. 2005. Changes in the Hengduan Mountains: Advancing treeline and retreating glaciers. Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research (accepted).\n\n\n2)  Effects of climate change and land management practices in the Hengduan Mountains of northwestern Yunnan, PR China: options for alpine conservation.\n\nWe have documented that herbaceous alpine meadows are decreasing and being replaced by woody vegetation as forest treelines advance and alpine shrub biomass increases. Alteration of land management practices and shifts in climate are thought to be the primary drivers of these changes. Furthermore, the growth of woody vegetation may be enhanced by changes in climate. Analyses of historical climate station data show that mean annual temperature in the last two decades has increased. at a rate of 0.6 deg C/10 yr.  We are using simulation results from the MC1 dynamic vegetation model (2 km cell size) and output from various state-of-the-art climate models to show how future climate may further alter these alpine ecosystems. Results from these simulations will be used to identify fire and grazing strategies to offset these threats to biodiversity and livelihoods of local inhabitants. \n\n\n3) Influence of past climatic variability on upper treeline and alpine vegetation in northwestern Yunnan.\n\nA rapidly warming climate and changes in land use, appear to be affecting upper treeline and alpine vegetation dynamics, thus threatening both biodiversity and Tibetan livelihoods in the Hengduan Mountains of northwestern Yunnan China. Conservation strategies designed to maintain or increase the viability of a particular species or community may be perfectly formulated for a predicted range of climatic conditions. However, future climate regimes may be outside the range of the natural variability for the target thereby reducing the viability of the conservation target under consideration.  We maintain that in order to understand how future climate regimes may influence alpine ecosystems and what conservation strategies will be effective in conserving alpine biological diversity, we must first characterize the nature of past variability. However, climate stations in this region were not installed prior to 1950. In addition the closet station is approximately 1000 m below and 20 km distant from our research sites Therefore, we are establishing a climate history from high-resolution proxy data like tree rings in order to reconstruct historical long-term climate trends.",

Those analyses are not only intended to investigate the influence of Indo-Pacific climate modes but also those modes by themselves: We will investigate ENSO, IOD and other modes of variabilities on interannual to decadal time scales. For example, changes in the spatial structure and temporal evolution of those climate events will be examined using EOF and other statistical methods. Interaction between seasonal variability and longer-time-scale variability will also be investigated. Since there are large\nuncertainties among model simulations owing to inherent model biases, one aim of our study is to intercompare model results. Those model results will also be validated with available observations and compared with our own model results. This will help us to understand the model biases and the inter-model spreads of certain key parameters. Besides understanding present day responses, we will study how these responses alter in the 21st century simulations.",

This will be done using model-to-satellite comparisons against microwave satellite data. The specific satellite dataset we will use is AMSU-B. The advantage of using microwave data is that microwave emission is less affected by clouds than is infrared.\n\nThe second analysis addresses the issue of whether changes in statistics of trajectories in a simulation of a changing climate have a strong effect on the probability distribution of relative humidity. The calculation follows a diagnostic trajectory-based approach along the lines carried out for the FOAM model in Pierrehumbert, Brogniez and Roca (2005, see preprint at http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1). The analysis uses as input the time-dependant wind and temperature fields from a control GCM run and a warm (eg. 4XCO2) run. Ideally, the data used should have at least 4xdaily time resolution.",

Actual install generation capacity is about 15400 MW and mean annual energy is 70400 Gwh. This system generate over 75% of the national energy production.\n\nIn the First National Communication over Climate change, it was detected that the grills over the river basin could suffer a reduction of the rainfall between 15 and 25% for year 2100. It that were the case, it would be a national tragedy.\n\nElectricidad del Caroni (EDELCA) a national company owner and operator of the system, wants to know the extent of the potential changes in order to take the necessary measurements to reduce and mitigate the impacts detected.\n\nWe will analyze data from several model in order to obtain the temperature foreseen changes over the river basin and consequently the changes in precipitation taking care of the models control series and the perturbed series under different climate scenarios, especially those presented in the SRES.\n\nWith the precipitation series we will perform an interpolation process with the Kriging disjunctive method. It will result in a series of monthly precipitation series divided in two sets. First from year 1950 to 2000, second from 2001 to 2100.\n\nIn previous works we have detected that there is a subestimation of precipitation presented in GCM and the real actual observed precipitation over the watershed. In that case, it will have to be scaled to actual values.\n\nThere is not a good evaporation pan coverture over the river basin, so the evaporation will have to be estimate thru indirect methods, perhaps thru temperatures and solar radiation data.\n\nWe will develop a mathematical model type LDM (Bayesian Linear dynamic Model)in order to convert water balance into runoff. We will compare results from the model with actual observation 1950-2004 and obtain runoff series 2000-2100. Statistical analysis will let to obtain and detect any possible change in the perturbed runoff series.\n\nWith the models series statistical parameters we will generate synthetic 100\nyears runoff series and with them and the physical parameters and restriction imposed in the Guri hydroelectric dam will simulate the power plant operation. Finally, comparison with historic simulated power generation data allows obtain the possible changes in the generation capacity.",

The disaster in New Orleans was foreseeable because of the likelihood of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and the inability of the city\u2019s levees to handle such an event.  According to the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control (IPCC) report, as global warming continues we will likely see an increase in flood magnitudes and frequency in most regions (IPCC WG2).  The report also states that in many regions, low river flows are likely to decrease leading to an increase in droughts as well.  Although there is agreement in the scientific community that there will be an increase in flooding and droughts, there is very little consensus as to how much precipitation will increase or where floods and droughts will occur.  Floods due to hurricanes such as Katrina are expected in low lying coastal areas prone to hurricanes but the locations of floods due to extreme rainfall events are not as easy to predict.\n\nIn an attempt to model and predict such phenomena, scientists have employed a variety of Global Circulation Models (GCMs).  However, the models are often not in agreement on the places that will be affected most by an increase or decrease in precipitation.  The only global visualization of annual mean precipitation change put forth in the 2001 IPCC working group 1 report was a multi-model average, which could actually obscure the individual predictions rather than pointing out their differences.  To illustrate the disagreement between models, examine the figure above.  Four different models were used to assess how soil moisture would change according to IPCC Scenario A2.  Scenario A2 assumes global CO2 levels will approach 1000 ppm by the year 2100. The figure shows the change in summer soil moisture between the last half of the 21st century, compared to the last half of the 20th century.  In some places the results are similar; in others they differ among the models. The \"q-flux\" models have specified ocean heat transports whereas the \u201cdynamic\u201d model allows ocean dynamical transports to change.  Note that the scales change; the models on the left (ranges from -50 cm to +50 cm on left and -5 cm to +5 cm on right) include soil moisture below rooting depth.  Therefore they have greater absolute values of soil moisture. As we can't see down to those levels, we don't know how wrong or right they are. Understanding the reasons behind the similarities and differences among these models, as well as others else where, is essential for better prediction.\n\nI am interested in exploring how and why current GCMs differ in their precipitation predictions.  I will attempt to understand the differences between models by analyzing the hydrologic changes -- precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and runoff -- from the two GISS simulations used in the upcoming 2007 IPCC report, as well as other in-house GISS models of varying climate sensitivity and physics.  With this data, I will then alter the GISS GCM in a controlled manner, and see if the pattern of hydrologic change can be predicted. From there, I will analyze similar output from the other GCMs in the IPCC database to identify tendencies induced by the model physics, or by biases in various models including GISS.  The biases will be determined by comparison with hydrologic (and radiative) observations of the current day climate, including output from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES). To the extent that the forecast hydrologic change depends upon the physics or biases in each model, it will allow us to better constrain predictions of future hydrologic changes.  As a graduate student at Columbia University, I have access to the NASA/GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) GCM and many of its contributors, making me uniquely equipped to carry out this research.\n\nAs policy-makers continue to consult scientists on issues of global warming, how will the scientific community respond?  If areas at high risk for flooding and drought could be identified, scientists, water use managers, and policy makers could work together to protect endangered areas or populations, averting future catastrophes.  Even if climatologists do not always come to the same conclusions on future climate, there is a rising need for comparative analysis of GCMs to understand why scientists disagree.",

The Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (CAOGCM) climate change simulations are available for various scenarios of greenhouse gas (GHG) and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions. The simulations can be characterized as (1) Reconstruction of an \"undisturbed\" pre&#151;industrial climate (2) Climate change experiments forced with observed atmospheric greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations since the middle of the 19th century (3) Scenario experiments of climate change based on different assumptions on future greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations (4) CO2 sensitivity experiments (1% per year increase). The new simulations show a mean global warming between 2.5 and 4.1 degrees Celsius until the end of this century - dependent on how much greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. One of the consequences: the seasonal varying sea ice decreases - the arctic could become ice free during late summer when the emissions will not be reduced.\n\nClimate over the Indian region is dominated by the monsoon rainfall during June- September. While the monsoon rainfall averaged over India shows no long term trend, the strong interannual variability results in extreme flood/drought conditions. Extreme flood/drought conditions in this region of over a billion often lead to catastrophe. Several of the earlier studies using CAOGCM climate change simulations have shown that in a warmer future climate scenario corresponding to late 21st century, Indian monsoon rainfall (IMR) shows an increase of over 10% relative to the 20th century climatology. This increase in rainfall is accompanied by enhanced strength of monsoon circulation due to enhanced warming of the Eurasian continent. The scenarios also indicate increase in the variability of the monsoon rainfall which would mean an increase in the frequency of extreme flood/drought years. This study examines these aspects of impact of global warming on the regional climate over India with special emphasis on the IMR and its interannual variability.",

This proposal seeks to also do an intercomparison of AOGCM responses using transfer function based systems identification and estimation techniques commonly employed in engineering. In particular, we are interested in evaluating the standard input-output response of AOGCMs forced with 1% annually incremented atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Early investigations using the 4xCO2 HadCM3 forcing experiment response confirm Lowe\u2019s (2003) finding that the dynamics are predominately second order, and we have demonstrated the feedback disaggregation of this response into its EBM unit components.

As the first step toward this objective, trends in large-scale tropical circulations and thermodynamic structures are investigated using multiple climate data. To examine large-scale circulations, intensities of Hadley, Walker, and monsoon circulations are defined based on velocity\npotential in the upper troposphere, and their climatology and interannual variations are compared. Climate data are reanalyses including ongoing Japanese data, and historical and future climate change experiments for the upcoming IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.",

            "abstract": "Global warming is the result of increasing greenhouse gases concentrations. It is linked with the increasing trend of daily rainfall amounts due to the increased atmospheric water vapor and increasing trend of the surface temperature. The Global Circulation Models (GCM) are used as a tool to simulate climate changes in rainfall and temperatures in response to anthropogenic greenhouse forcing. In previous studies, preliminary evaluation of GCM, over the eastern Mediterranean region was used as an input for estimating changes in local processes affecting the water balance in the region. (Segal et.al, 1994) \n\nRecent studies of rainfall trends in the Mediterranean basin, have pointed on a paradoxical increase of ex\u00adtreme rainfall in spite of decrease in the totals, as shown by Alpert et al., 2002, for stations in Italy and Spain. This trend was observed over most parts of Israel excluding the south- central and south,  (the semi- arid zone) which show an opposite trend of increase in totals rainfall amounts. The exception of the semi- arid Israeli belt from the regional trend was linked to the effect of large modifications in land use, partly resulting from the connection of southern Israel to the national water carrier in 1964, Ben-Gai, et. al., (1993, 1998). Furthermore, a positive link was found between land use changes and the enhancement of thermal convection and induced rainfall. (Perlin & Alpert, 2001) Another explanation is the increase in the frequency of sub-tropical anti-cyclones, particularly over the western and central Mediterranean (Alpert et al., 2002), and according to NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for the period 1958 \u2013 1998, a southward transition of low-pressure anomalies in the second half of the 20th century over the eastern Mediterranean. During the 90\u2019s a center of low-pressure anomaly moved over southern Israel. \nA very recent study has shown the increasing of red sea trough events, which affect the rainfall events in the southern part of Israel. (Alpert et al, 2002)\n\nTemperature analysis of Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 40 stations in Israel revealed that the frequency of occurrence of extreme temperature events, with lower winter and higher summer temperatures, has increased. (Ben-Gai et al, 1999) Both observations and modeling studies results indicate fewer rainy days and extreme rainfall and temperatures events possibly as a result of global warming. \n\nDue to its location bordering the semi arid zone and encompassing opposite rainfall trends in its northern to southern parts, Israel represents a complex and exceptional climate change behavior. Therefore, we wish to study the results of several GCMs, to investigate their ability to simulate the climate over the eastern Mediterranean region and to analyze the simulated greenhouse gas induced changes in temperature and precipitation in this area. The suitable data for this purpose would be global sets of monthly means of the available parameters. ",

For the models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), this weakening shows a significant dependence on the initial THC strength: it is stronger for initially strong overturning. We propose a physical mechanism for this phenomenon based on an analysis of additional simulations with the coupled climate models CLIMBER-2 and CLIMBER-3alpha. The mechanism is based on the fact that sea ice cover greatly reduces heat loss from the ocean. The extent of sea ice is determined mainly by the near surface atmospheric temperature (SAT) in the North Atlantic but \nalso by the strength of the THC itself which transports heat to the convection \nsites. Initially larger sea-ice cover responds more strongly to atmospheric warming, thus sea ice retreats more strongly for an initially weaker THC. This sea ice retreat provides a stabilising feedback on the THC, and this stabilising feedback is stronger for an initially weaker THC, thus making it weaken less in climate model simulations.",

Thus, it is important to have this quantity correctly reproduced in climate models for a realistic prediction of climate change. Therefore evaluation of upper tropospheric humidity (UTH) in current climate models is an important test for their fidelity in predicting global climate. One way to evaluate model UTH is to compare it with observation. Satellite based observations give global coverage thus are suitable for climate model evaluation. Satellite sensors measure UTH using infrared and microwave techniques. In this study we plan to evaluate Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) using microwave data measured by Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit - B (AMSU-B) instruments on board NOAA satellites. Microwave data are less affected by clouds than infrared data. Monthly mean temperature and humidity profiles from GCM output are used as inputs to a radiative transfer model to simulate radiances as observed by AMSU-B and then the comparison with the observations is done in the radiance space. This method circumvents errors that occur in the retrieval process of temperature and humidity profiles from satellite radiances. Inter-model differences as well as differences in the mean state of the models compared to observation will be addressed in detail.",

One of the key questions challenging the economy of Central Asia, and, subsequently, its environment is the low energy efficiency. Therefore, the research of the energy demand characteristics, which can be useful in solving of this enormous problem, was selected as a topic for master\u2019s paper by a student from Uzbekistan, who has currently been studying in the Toyohashi University of Technology (Toyohashi, Japan). The coupled GCM outputs could be used as a basis for assessment of environmental situation in Central Asia (and Uzbekistan, in particular). It, in turn, will allow assessing the energy demand in Uzbekistan up to 2030, taking into account the fact, that the probable increase in air temperature and decrease in precipitation level can enlarge energy demand for maintaining comfortable temperature in buildings.",

In particular, I study what factors and characteristics of the tropical ocean and the atmosphere affect the amplitude, frequency and other important properties of El Ni\u00f1o. One of those factors, which also influence stability properties of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, is net energy dissipation rates in the ocean.\n\nTo quantify those dissipation rates, one can consider the damping (decay) timescale for the thermocline anomalies associated with the large-scale oceanic motion. Fedorov (2006) explored these ideas in an oceanic GCM using the analyses of the ocean energetics  conducted by Goddard and Philander (2000). He found that the damping rate was dependent upon the frequency range. In the interannual frequency range, he found a damping of (2.3 years)-1, similar to the values used in the original Cane and Zebiak (1987) model. In the near annual frequency sub-range, the damping had larger values of about (7 months)-1. \n\nFedorov\u2019s analysis was limited to an ocean-only model forced with observed monthly winds. The low temporal resolution of the windstress smoothed out the effect of important ENSO forcing features such as westerly wind bursts. We will firstly explore Fedorov\u2019s analysis technique using coupled model data, to see if there is a difference between coupled models and ocean-only models, and also whether increased temporal resolution leads to significantly different outcomes. Having weekly data, as opposed to monthly, will also allow us to improve the resolution of the analysis for high frequency events.  Further, we will explore this problem by comparing damping rates in different coupled models. We hypothesize that the damping scales will vary and that this may explain the differing ENSO properties simulated by different coupled GCMs, Guilyardi (2005).",

Such climate induced warming events are forcing marine protected area managers to reassess and adapt their conservation strategies. Managers need new tools to identify coral communities at low risk of succumbing to thermal stress both to protect existing marine protected areas, and to guide decisions about the location and design of new MPAs. In an attempt to provide such tools, this project aims to use available data from remote sensing and other monitoring systems to generate maps through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) of the Coral Triangle indicating reefs of higher and lower thermal stress now and projected into the future. The project will also analyze historical and future projected SSTs using general circulation models to assess reef hot spots and cool spots. GIS maps of reef vulnerabilty will provide marine conservation planners with a tool to help identify coral reefs for conservation purposes that are well positioned to survive climate-related increases in temperature. In addition, the maps and reports generated will be used to inform policy makers of the need to take immediate action to address climate change on local, national, and global levels.",

We are interested in examine how this relationship may change in the next 100 years as predicted from GCM simulations for 1-2 emissions scenarios. An extension of this work is to examine how variability and future changes in East African rainfall may affect ecosystem productivity. For this work I will be using the climate-driven dynamic ecosystem model LPJ.  The analysis will be done by myself and the data required are projections of surface air temperature, precipitation and solar radiation/cloud amount for ~6 GCMs and the A1, A2, B1 and B2 emissions scenarios.  In another project with colleagues at the University of Edinburgh, we are investigating the role of lightning and deep convection on atmospheric chemistry using a combined modelling (HadAM3-STOCHEM climate-chemistry model) and satellite (observations from the recently launched EOS-MLS instrument on AURA) study. We would also like to examine future multi-model GCM projections of changes in convection and lightning and see how these compare with our HadCM3-STOCHEM model simulations. Lightning NOx emissions will be calculated according to Price et al. (1997) whereby lightning is related to cloud top height and location. Again, the analysis would be done by myself and the required GCM fields are convective precipitation and cloud fraction per atmospheric layer again for ~6 GCMs and 2-4 emission scenarios.",

            "abstract": "In many respects sustainable development of any region is defined by climate conditions. This is especially relevant for naturally guided sectors of economy as hydro-electricity, agriculture, forestry, transportation, tourism/recreation, and fishery. The role of a climate is strengthening by that fact that many natural parameters are climatically stipulated. In this respect, climate is a natural Climatic Resource [CR] determining potential opportunities and headway of any region. The natural energy CR include water- and wind power. The transportation, tourism/recreation CR include temperature and precipitation, duration of cold and warm season, etc. \n\nThe CR are affected by the Global Climate Change [GCC]  depending from regional geography and environmental characteristics. Recognition of the CR variability is necessary for the development of appropriate adaptation strategies to achieve environmental/economic balance for sustainable development of any particular area. Such recognition requires reliable short- and long time climate projecting.\n\nThis project will be used to predict changes in temperature, daily solar radiation, duration of winter/summer seasons, precipitation, humidity, wind velocity, etc., within the East European Plane.  Data of climate simulation can be used to predict sustainability of CR.  For a variable area as the East European Plane Region, a one-size-fits-all approach is unsuitable, yet sub-regional-scale information on climate change is not readily available. Not only there is a scientific need to understand regional climate change, there also is a economical one. If a balance between the economy and the environment is sought, this balance must be optimised sub-regionally, in the environmental and economical interest. Our proposed project is the tool that can make this optimisation possible, for one particular sub-region in Europe, while laying the framework for optimisation elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, the project aims to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of the GCC on public health in the region based on the predicted parameter changes, and suggests possible mitigation strategies in terms of their practical application.

Such climatic parameters availed in the IPCC model output may be studied carefully to get indications of warming trend in future in the regional scale.

A characteristic of coupled climate model simulations is the strong bias in regional precipitation and tropical hydrology, despite the increasing fidelity with which they represent the large scale circulation.  These biases occur despite robust observed relationships between the large scale circulation and regional precipitation (e.g. the monsoon circulation, or relationships with ENSO variability).  We intend to investigate the feasibility of using empirical downscaling models (EDMs; e.g. Widmann et al., 2003) to \ndebias and downscale regional precipitation over Indonesia and the Maritime Continent.  Preliminary analysis shows that this approach is very useful for debiasing the annual cycle of precipitation over Indonesia in coupled model simulations.\n\nThe EDMs will be constructed using observations of the large scale circulation (from the NCEP reanalysis; Kalnay et al., 1996) and regional precipitation (from station data, and from the U. Delaware Climatologically Aided Interpolation data set; Willmott and Matsuura, 2001).  We will use large scale fields which are known to have physical relationships with precipitation (e.g. upper and lower level zonal winds and the monsoon shear line; SLP and the Southern Oscillation; and lower level specific humidity and the hydrological cycle).  These EDMs \nwill be applied to model output from the present-day IPCC AR4 simulations, as well as future simulations (we will focus on the A2 and B1 scenarios).  One problem with this approach is that we cannot test how well EDM that are developed using present day analyses represent future precipitation in the observed record.  Thus, we will also develop EDMs \"within the model world\", using the same large-scale predictors from each present-day model simulation, and precipitation from the same model simulations.  These EDMs will then be used to \"downscale\" the future precipitation to determine which large-scale \nvariables are most important for training the EDMs.",

If the MOC's influence on the sea surface temperature is well established, it will also project on the predicatibility of the SST or through the SST we can know more about the MOC.\n\nIt is quite interesting that both GFDL and ECHAM5/MPIOM show scaling from years to decades, beyond this the MOC tends to be white, which says no long term mermory. so on one hand, it is consistent with Hasselmann's theory (1976); on the other hand, because my coarse coupled ECHAM5/MPIOM shows different results, this says the existence of long term memory can be model-dependent, which probably is very interesting to check as a model comparison index.",

            "abstract": "In the mid-latitudes, day-to-day weather is basically controlled by the passages of cyclones and anticyclones. While society is faced with global warming due to increase in greenhouse gases, an issue that is not well understood is how the \nstorm tracks may change. Shifts in the location of the storm tracks, or changes in the storm track activity, can lead to droughts or floods, and affect the frequency of occurrence of severe weather, and is therefore one of the most important factors governing regional climate change. In addition, these storms are responsible for transporting huge amounts of heat, moisture, and momentum, hence changes in the storm tracks can also lead to changes in the global circulation.\n\nWhile storm track changes are present in GCM simulations of global warming, few studies have been conducted to examine them in detail since previous generations of GCMs have poor simulations of storm tracks. With improvements in physical parameterizations as well as increase in model resolution, the current generation of GCMs does a much better job in simulating the climatological distribution of storm tracks. However, to date no detailed validation of how well storm track variability is simulated by GCMs has been conducted, making it impossible to assess how reliable GCM predicted storm track changes are. \n\nIn this project, GCM simulations of storm tracks and their variability and change will be assessed in detail, using a suite of diagnostic and modeling studies. The main goals are to quantitatively assess whether deficiencies in GCM storm track simulations could give rise to deficiencies in the GCMs prediction of how the storm tracks may change, and to achieve quantitative understanding of GCM predictions of storm track changes under global warming. Results from this project will enable the scientific community to assess the uncertainties present in such predictions.\n\nIn this project, GCM simulations of storm track variability will be compared in detail to observed storm track variability. Apart from statistical assessment of the fidelity of GCM simulated storm track variations, several prominent modes of storm track variability will be examined in detail. While there are other projects that focus on studying how storm track may change under various global warming scenarios, the novelty of this project is in the use of a combination of linear and nonlinear storm track and stationary wave models to quantitatively assess whether deficiencies in GCM simulations are of dynamical significance. In addition, dynamical models having various levels of complexity will also be employed to quantitatively understand and relate GCM predicted storm track and mean flow changes. In this study, simulations conducted using GFDL climate models will serve as reference, but other GCM simulations archived as part of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report process will also be examined for comparison. This study is in collaboration with Dr. Isaac Held at GFDL.",

Given the limited length of the available RO data (continuous since 2002) re-analyses will be used to extend the observational datasets back to 1979. Global climate model scenario simultations for the IPCC AR4 will be used as multi-decadal \"proxy\" datasets out to year 2050. The datasets will be systematically explored for finding the most robust and sensitive climate change indicators. Based on these identified indicators, the trend detection capabilities of RO observations will be investigated using methods of optimal trend detection. Validation of climate model runs with the observational data will complete the investigation.

Over the Eastern Mediterranean region several studies have been conducted on water resources and its importance but none of them have focused on the role of future climate change. Trans-boundary streamflows (Euphrates-Tigris) are the main sources of the water for the region, not only for domestic and industrial usage, but also for energy. To understand present and future climate changes over the Euphrates-Tigris basin, we have focused on the precipitation component of the regional hydrological cycle. The regional climate model (RegCM3) has been used to downscale the regional climate simulations of the Finite Volume GCM (1\u00b0x1.25\u00b0). Based on IPCC GHG forcing and present conditions, climate change over the region of interest has been investigated.\n\nOur primary finding is that the climate anomalies associated with the projected regional global warming tend to manifest themselves in terms of multi-decadal variability North Atlantic Oscillation. More specifically, there is dramatic precipitation increase (30%) over the northern part of domain of interest (Black Sea). In contrast, the southern part of the domain of interest exhibits the opposite anomaly conditions. We hypothesize that these changes in precipitation could have very significant implications regarding the total hydrological cycle over the region.",

Communities may have a window of opportunity to prepare, but information to support preparation programs is sparse. For a small city&#146;s watershed we assessed the present culvert system&#146;s capacity for conveying expected peak flow, Qp, resulting from climate change and full build-out. Least squares regression was used to transfer, to the study site, expected increases to point process location, scale, and regionalized shape parameters for 6 grid points from the GFDL CM-2.1 GCM. Runoff rates and Qp were modeled by the NRCS TR-55 curve number and HEC-22 methods. Standard civil engineering methods were used to reverse-engineer existing culverts, and replacement costs were estimated using national construction cost estimators. The mid-21st century 25-year precipitation is estimated to be 29% greater than the historical 25-year precipitation, and 15% greater than the TP-40 design storm. The 15% increase over the TP-40 value equals the 15% rule of thumb proposed by previous research. 44% of culverts likely will be undersized as a result of climate change and build-out, placing people and property at risk. A long-term upgrade project, utilizing existing strategies to manage uncertainty and costs, may maintain historically acceptable risk levels. This study shows that current GCM output and statistical methods can generate reliable and specific estimates of impacts from climate change, in support of programs to prepare civil infrastructures.",

The AR4 simulations will be the perfect setting to investigate whether the theory we have used to interpret the static stability changes in the simple model is applicable in climate change scenarios.  Closely linked to the determination of the static stability of the atmosphere is the tropopause height.  In our idealized model,  the tropopause height in midlatitudes increases along with the static stability, as predicted in simple theories (Held 1982).  We will investigate first whether a similar increase in tropopause height can be seen robustly in the AR4 simulations.  If this increase can be seen,  we will investigate whether the change in static stability is important,  or whether other effects such as stratospheric cooling are dominant.  ",

If the regional Hadley cell becomes weaker a diminished convective activity in the Inter-Tropical zone of convergence can be expected (at least in zonal averages) as a consequence of the weaker convergence of tropical flows. This would affect the monsoonic systems that characterize the summer rainfall in extensive  tropical and subtropical regions. Moreover,  if the strength of large scale and synoptic waves becomes affected at mid-latitudes,  it would decrease the transport of heat from the tropics to mid-latitudes and the westward transport of momentum. This ultimately might affect the strength of the trade winds and would therefore cause alterations to the climate not only in the tropics but across the planet. the winter climate is highly influenced by the activity of mid-latitude waves. The so-called \"nortes\" are the result of these waves interacting with lower latitudes. The nortes and cold fronts associated with these waves are not only responsible for changing temperature and regional wind patterns  but also bring about winter rainfall of considerable importance for Mexico. An alteration to the dynamics of these waves  would be manifested in changes to the hydrological cycle in several regions of the country.",

            "abstract": "Understanding natural climate variability and how it could be modified under climate change is recognised to be an important and pragmatic way to address climate change adaptation in southern Africa.  Hence, a knowledge of how African rainfall variability relates to natural variability and how this relationship is simulated by coupled models, the prime tools for projections of climate change, is one prerequisite for climate change adaptation on the continent. An anomalous SST pattern, associated with summer rainfall extremes over southern Africa, has been observed in this section of the Indian Ocean.  Experiments carried out using the HadAM3 model have shown this anomalous SST gradient in the southwest Indian Ocean to produce a large atmospheric circulation response over southern Africa.  We have found that this pattern is also a leading mode of rainfall-related SST variability in the southwest Indian Ocean in a coupled model - the HadCM3 1000-year simulation.  We have investigated the evolution of the SST anomaly pattern through a range of atmospheric and oceanic variables in the model. We plan to use the AR4 data to carry out a systematic examination of southwest Indian Ocean SST variability in coupled models to discover what modes of rainfall-related SST variability exist, and how these evolve, now and in the future.  Analysis of this type, as noted above, is very important in enhancing understanding of how climate variability over southern Africa is linked to current and future natural modes of variability in coupled models.",

            "abstract": "Using a newly published analysis of global climate models over West Africa, this study will analyze the impact of three potential futures described by global climate change scenarios.  USAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System Network\u2019s livelihood baseline system provides an opportunity to determine the vulnerability of food systems in West Africa to future climate changes.  Using the increased information on the food and income sources for three economic groups in Niger as a case study, the vulnerability of the food systems to potential climate changes in West Africa will be assessed.  By focusing on the potential changes in the food systems in the region in the next century, we can identify actions that organizations with decision support systems with food security and food systems at their center, such as FEWS NET and AGHRYMET, can take to modify the risks to the population.\n\nIn a recent study of 18 coupled model simulations from global models included in the analysis for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report, only three had a reasonable representation of the West African atmosphere and monsoon system during the past few decades(Cook & Vizy 2005).  Precipitation, circulation and interannual variability were examined for all models to identify those with a reasonable ability to simulate past climate, in order to determine which may have believable simulations of possible future climate dynamics in the 21st century.  65 model integrations were examined from the 18 coupled GCM\u2019s.  Three models were selected: MIROC_MED, MRI and GFDL_0.  These models had very different scenarios for the future for West Africa.  The GFDL model had a very negative picture, resulting from a large off-shore winds from the Atlantic eventually  the reversal of the monsoon flow, disrupting the ability of the monsoon to bring rain to the Sahel.  The MIROC_MED model accentuated the moisture flow, resulting in a very positive picture for West Africa,  with a large increase in moisture.  The third (which Cook and Vizy consider by far the most likely of the models examined) was the MRI model produced a situation where increasing CO2 levels created increasing periods of drought and variability through the period,  without any large changes in overall moisture to the region.\n\nThese scenarios will be assessed using simulated rainfall and vegetation dynamic information from matching the inter-annual dynamics seen during the past twenty-five years to the model dynamics, then extending the \u2018potential\u2019 vegetation and rainfall to 2100 using the model anomalies shown above.  These will be the input to the socio-economic analysis framework described below.\n\nUsing newly available information on the ways people make a living in Africa, the study will evaluate the impact on three economic groups (poor,  and better off) possible future changes in climate.  Recent research has provided a way to couple local food prices and environmental variability (Brown et al. 2006),  permitting a rough measure of future price variability in the underdeveloped regions of Niger to be coupled with models of environmental change.  By varying the amount of food produced and food access in the markets, an index of basic food security for each economic group and livelihood zone in Niger can be obtained by year to parallel variations in rainfall from the GCM scenarios.",

The CHG provides climate and agro-meteorological analyses to support USAID food security applications,  primarily in Africa. As geographer/climatologists we specialize in the interpretation of climate information in socio-agronomic contexts. Salient examples of this work involve analysis of the recent drought in Eastern Africa, and mid-season prognoses of the 2002/03 and 2003/04 growing seasons in Southern Africa. We are presently working with partners within the Famine Early Warning System Network to develop analytic frameworks for evaluating the potential food security impacts of multi-year droughts.\n\nWe have three specific questions: i) what are the potential changes in on-shore moisture transports into Africa,  ii) what are the potential changes in upper atmospheric circulation patterns,  and iii) what might these changes imply for African rainfall,  especially during the heart of the growing season in the most vulnerable sub-Saharan countries. We are concerned that warming in the tropical Indian and Atlantic oceans may tend to reduce or redirect moisture transports,  while weakening the upper level easterlies typically associated with strong convection. Access to the IPCC simulations will allow us to examine these hypotheses  and link these circulation changes to potential variations in precipitation. These results could have dramatic implications for Africa,  and directly address the \"sustainable development\" theme of the IPCC. ",

Particularly, the proposal seeks to understand and quantify how global climate change affects the eastern South Pacific. It is of a primary importance to assess what large scale ocean-atmosphere processes are important to define main characteristics of the regional climate: mean-state and variability on different timescales. Nowadays, a significant part of our knowledge on regional climate variability has been focused on El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related fluctuations, in the atmosphere and in the ocean. However, other lesser-studied timescales \u2013like intraseasonal and interdecadal\u2013 seems also to play a significant role in the regional climate system. \n\nKey research questions to be addressed by the group are:\n\n1) How ongoing climate change has affected circulation, water mass distribution, and sea surface conditions in the eastern South Pacific during last decades?\n\n2) What is the nature of and what are the mechanisms governing the natural decadal and interdecadal variability in the South Pacific Ocean?\n\n3) How climate changes affect coastal upwelling  in the eastern South Pacific Ocean?\n\n4) How climate changes affect intraseasonal variability in the equatorial Pacific and along the western coast of South America?\n\n\n",

The question is: In which countries will climate change be especially relevant for tourism? With the current research I aim to give an initial answer to this question.\n\nI apply the concept of vulnerability to the tourism sector. I am developing a vulnerability index for the tourism sector. Calculated worldwide on a national level,  this index will allow to identify \"hot spots\",  single out factors contributing to vulnerability and guide subsequent research or awareness raising and adaptation efforts. The results will be divided into three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.

Specifically we would like to study the impact of increasing heat content in the Pacific and Indian Oceans on the Indian Summer Monsoon and its effect on soil moisture and the consequent feebbacks. We also plan to analyse changes on the sub-seasonal scales under various scenarios. Methods of analysis such as the Continous Wavelet Techniques in Space and Time (CWT-ST) and the Intrinsic Mode Function techniques (IMF) would be used in this study. The study for Quasi-biennial variability will be done by initially studying the occurrence of these events with the control simulations, followed by studies under various scenarios up to 2200.",

Furthermore information from forecasts can be used to identify model errors and the processes that determine predictability.

Among the most important are impacts on wind power resources and on dust production.   It is often stated that mid-latitude winds are expected to decrease in a doubled CO2 world, since positive feedbacks at the poles should reduce the meridional temperature gradient, which by thermal wind balance would then reduce jet stream winds, reducing vertical wind gradients, and therefor surface winds. However, surface winds are determined not only by gradient of wind in the boundary layer,  but also by the static stability and the degree of surface thermal forcing of turbulence.   Changes in these variables also strongly influence surface wind speed.  \n\nIn this study,  we will examine output from a range of general circulation model projections of the climate of the 21st century.  We will look at predictions of the climate statistics for surface wind,  including the terms of the global angular momentum budget, and attempt to isolate the causes of differences among the various models.\n",

Hence, whether or not TC formation will be affected due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is of great concern, especially given the increasingly large coastal population (Emanuel, 2005).\n\nDue to the difficulty of simulating TCs directly with models, mainly because of coarse resolution and parameterization,  it is interesting to look for alternate methods to estimate future TC activity.  One such method is by looking at diagnostic relationships between large scale parameters and TC formation.  One example of this being the seasonal genesis parameters (SGP) as proposed by Gray (1975),  which allows for a geographical repartitioning of the seasonal frequency of TC formation,  given current climate condition.  The six parameters are divided between dynamical factors (coriolis,  low level vorticity and vertical wind shear) and thermodynamic factors (moist static stability,  mid-tropospheric moisture and upper ocean temperature).  The SGP is a reasonably accurate method of identifying seasons and geographic location where TC activity may be high or low.",

However, an increase in the intensity or in the frequency of intense tropical cyclones, which is what climate change scenarios suggest, does not necessarily correlate with an increase in the frequency of landfalling storms. A statistically based algorithm has been developed at AIR-Worldwide that relates large-scale environmental parameters to historical tropical cyclone tracks. We desire to evaluate the algorithm using model output from available GCM climate change scenarios. Results from the study will shed light on how climate change may potentially affect landfalling frequencies of tropical cyclones. Results will be submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n",

A first study was published in GRL (vol 33, L13807, doi:10.1029/2006GL026180, 2006) looking at the impact of ships emissions on the levels of ozone and ozone precursors due to the opening of new shipping routes in the Arctic passages in the decades ahead. In the planned study,  we would like to compare the sea ice area and the sea ice thickness provided by different IPCC models in order to evaluate the likeliness of shipping in the Arctic area. From these comparisons,  we will design shipping routes in the Arctic and develop emissions distributions from ships in the Arctic area. Using these data,  we will be able to asses the pollution expected from a fleet of ships in the Arctic. We will use the distribution of ice provided by the different IPCC models to evaluate the uncertainty of our calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Mechoso) and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (PI: Andrew W. Robertson).\n \nOcean-atmosphere interactions are a topic of major interest in the climate research community because of the potential such interactions have for predicting climatic anomalies over the adjacent continents on interannual time scales. This project addresses the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land-surface processes underlying tropical Atlantic SST variability, with the ultimate goal of improving seasonal-to-interannual climate forecasts for the region. The project uses various configurations of a global climate system model that features atmospheric, oceanic, and land-surface components, as well as a nested regional model.\n \nAs part of this research effort we are studying the representation of the South Atlantic anticyclone in the UCLA AGCM. Compared to observations, the model produces an anticyclone that is shifted to the west and too elongated in the zonal direction. This has serious consequences for the simulated mean climate as well as interannual variability. Data from the NCAR CCSM and the PCM indicate that this problem may exist in other models too.",

First, I will determine whether ant-, vertebrate-, and wind-dispersed plant species differ in the degree to which their distributions are at equilibrium with current climate. Next, I will predict future shifts in the distributions of plant species of each of these dispersal modes in response to multiple scenarios of climate change to quantify the range of expected magnitudes of these shifts. Ultimately, I aim to understand the importance of dispersal mutualisms to the relationship between climate change, species distributions, and patterns of plant diversity in Western Australia.\n",

The objective of this project is to evaluate the similiarity between the spatial structures of the model-simulated responses to El Ni\u00f1o and global warming. Variables, such as precipitation, surface temperature, surface pressure, winds, cloud cover, and soil moisture will be examined over the tropics. Linear regression of these variables against an ENSO index (e.g., Nino-3 SST) will be used to describe the spatial patterns of change associated with ENSO for each model. These results will use the 20C3M archive of model output. The resulting regression patterns will be normalized and ensemble-averaged across multiple models to provide a \"consensus pattern\" of ENSO change. These patterns of ENSO-induced change will be compared to that arising from increased greenhouse gases using the SRES A1b scenario runs for the period 2000-2100.  Instead of using regressing against Nino-3 index, we will compute the spatial pattern of the linear trend in the\nabove variables per degree global warming. This \"global warming\" pattern will be also be ensemble averaged to emphasize those aspects of the projected response which are robust across models and compared to the \"ENSO\" pattern.\n \nReferences:\nVecchi, G.A., B.

Both values are from the coast of the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The differences in those values in very close areas can indicate the low quality of those data.\nWhen analyzing the altimetry data from the mission TOPEX/POSEIDON, trends ranging from 0.77mm/yr to 5.36mm/yr are observed for the period from 1993 to 2005 along the Brazilian coast. When compared with the closest tide-gauge data for the period 1993-2005, the correlation between these data is small. \nThe short period of altimetry data, the low quality and low number of tide-gauge stations along the coast of Brazil makes necessary the use of numerical model data with the objective of trying to understand the past variations of the sea level in the Brazilian coast.",

            "abstract": "Traditional statistical techniques in climatology emphasize primarily the computation of moments (i.e., means and variances), and correlations between variables.  In spite of the arguable success of this approach, it is based on underlying assumptions (unimodality and linearity) that do not universally apply to the climate system.  We are working on an alternate formulation of climate based on information theory.  In this picture of climate the basic quantity for quantifying variability is the Shannon Entropy (SE) and the basic measure of association is the Mutual Information (MI).  These quantities both have solid, useful connotations for discrete variables.   For continuous variables, however, the SE is ill-defined, possibly taking on negative or infinite values, but the MI is a well-defined and reliable quantity.  Thus, the problem for continuous systems becomes one of finding a surrogate for the SE to quantify variability, and we have identified a number of candidate quantities.\n \nThe application for access to IPCC AR4 output is driven by an interest in applying these concepts to a large number of model output data sets.  \n \nWe will begin by studying discretized variables (e.g., cloud amount expressed in octas or tenths), where we can compute both the SE and MI with confidence, using these metrics to quantify both spatial and temporal variability.  Where possible, we will use SE and MI to quantify relative strengths in relationships between climate variables.  We will do this for a wide variety of model output sets, and thus will be doing an intercomparison in the process.  We will also apply the SE and MI to model data prepared (through intermesh interpolation) in a form that will allow 1) direct intermodel comparisons using information theory and 2) an assessment of the overall amount of information the models share (also called \u201credundancy\u201d).\n \nThe application of information theory to continuous variables will be pursued as described above.  Since the SE is not always well defined for continuous variables, we will experiment with various approaches to 1) discretizing the continuous data and then computing the SE and MI, and 2) using alternatives to the SE to calibrate the MI for use in model variability studies and model intercomparison.\n \nThe expected outcomes of this work are 1) a set of results applying information-theoretic principles to assess climate variability, 2) a more general approach identify the existence of relationships among climate variables, and 3) a distinctly different and more general approach to model intercomparison.

            "abstract": "The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is an air-sea coupled phenomenon associated with a positive sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) to the west and a negative SSTA to the east (Saji et al. 1999; Webster et al. 1999).  It has turned out that the IOD has a large impact on climate of both the surrounding and remote regions such as East Asia, Europe, and South America (Yamagata et al. 2004).  Thus, understanding as well as simulating the IOD is crucial to global climate research.\n\nRecently, Ashok et al. (2001) have shown that the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is not correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in recent decades owing to the frequent occurrences of the IOD.  Behera and Yamagata (2003) have revealed that the IOD even weakens the link between El Ni\u00f1o and the Southern Oscillation through influencing the pressure at Darwin.  Since the seminal work by Nitta and Yamada (1989), the decadal variability in the tropical Pacific has been studied extensively in recent decades.  However, the decadal phenomenon in the tropical Indian Ocean has received little attention, partly owing to lack of available observational data.  \n\nAmong a few studies, Meehl et al. (1998) and Allan et al. (2003) discussed a link with the decadal ENSO-like variability in the Pacific.  Also, Reason et al. (1996a) suggested the importance of decadal variability in the subtropical anticyclone in the southern Indian Ocean, while Reason et al. (1996b) showed that the decadal variability in the winds over the Pacific may introduce decadal variations in the southern Indian Ocean via the Indonesian Throughflow.  More recently, Tozuka et al. (2006) have revealed, using SINTEX-F1 coupled GCM, that the decadal modulation of the interannual IOD events is associated with that of the southward Ekman heat transport across 15\u00b0S induced by changes in the Mascarene High (Reason et al. 1996).  They have also shown that the heat transport by the Indonesian Throughflow associated with the ENSO (Meyers 1996) is a major factor that explains the decadal modulation.\n\nUsing the IPCC model outputs, we plan to investigate the decadal variation in the tropical Indian Ocean.  In particular, we investigate how and why the occurrence of simulated Indian Ocean Dipole varies decadally using both atmospheric data (such as OLR, wind stress, and rainfall), and oceanic data (such as temperature and current fields).\n\n",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice cover has become thinner, younger, and more vulnerable to increasing polar temperatures during recent decades. This decline was accompanied by significant change in patterns of the Arctic atmospheric circulation, resulting in longer summer melt seasons, greater intrusions of warm Atlantic water, and different trajectories of ice motion. Interannual distributions of multi-year ice have exhibited high variability during the past two decades, especially in peripheral seas surrounding the central Arctic basin.\n\nAssessing variability of the Arctic sea ice habitats in conditions of climate change based on multisensor satellite observations provides important information for improving our understanding of Arctic marine ecosystems. Recent and dramatic changes in sea ice and melt conditions have been observed in the Western Arctic, which in turn affect the sea ice habitats of marine mammals and other ecosystem components.  Studies suggest that wind anomalies over the Bering Sea play a dominant role in the year-to-year ice variations. For the thermodynamic mechanism, winds may contribute to anomalous sea ice formations via heat flux anomalies.  Northerly winds bring cold and dry air onto the Bering Sea, which enhances the ocean-to-atmosphere heat fluxes, and in turn which can result in greater ice formations. This project will help elucidate the principal mechanisms that affect age and thickness distributions of Arctic sea ice, and provide useful information for improving predictive models of sea ice conditions.\n\nThis project will study:\n\n1)  variability in sea ice concentrations, age structure and thickness distributions, the dates of melt onset, and rates of melting in the Bering and Chukchi Seas in 1979-2006, \n\n2)  effects of variability in the dates of the melt onset on patterns of ice seal reproduction and molt, \n\n3)  long term trends in ice parameters and melting events in the Bering and Chukchi Seas and their influence on Arctic marine ecosystems, and  \n\n4)  models of sea ice extent to evaluate the probabilities of the Bering and Chukchi Seas becoming ice-free in future decades.\n",

This debate arises from the occurrence of more devastating hurricanes/typhoons in this decade, and became perfervid with the ruin of New Orleans by Katrina last year. So far, there is no confident report on this issue though some preliminary examinations (Henderson et al. 1998) was conducted and published recent years. \n\nWe want to do some research on this issue. The basic idea is we assume there must have some kind of relationships between TC genesis/intensity and SST. But these relationships are mixed with the relationships between TC genesis/intensity and large-scale dynamic background. Thus we first want to try to separate those relationships with the observational data or IPCC model analysis data. With those obtained separated relationships, second, we want to find out what is the impact of climate change on tropical cyclone genesis and intensity based on climate change projections from IPCC model outputs.\n",

Historical data from the last 50 years and proxy data from cores collected off the coasts of Peru will not only be used for the validation of some characteristics of the regional model, but also interpreted in the light of the different regional simulations taking climatic variability at pre-industrial, present and future eras into account (IPCC model outputs). Specific diagnostics are intended to be carried out, that will diagnose in a synthetic way the change in mean vertical structure of the equatorial Pacific (Dewitte et al., 2006, \u201cRectification of the ENSO variability by interdecadal changes in the equatorial background mean state in a CGCM simulation \u00bb.

Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), constructed from the best track dataset for the region for the period 1950-2002, and other related variables are analyzed. ACE is positively correlated with ENSO indices. This and other statistics of the interannually varying tropical cyclone distribution are used to show that there is a tendency in El Ni\u02dcno years towards tropical cyclones which are both more intense and longer-lived than in La Nina years. ACE leads ENSO indices: during the peak season (northern summer and fall) ACE is correlated approximately as strongly with ENSO indices up to six months later (northern winter) as simultaneously. It appears that not all of this lead-lag relationship is easily explained by the autocorrelation of the ENSO indices, though much of it is. Interannual variations in the annual mean lifetime, intensity and number of tropical cyclones all contribute to the ENSO signal in ACE, though the lifetime effect appears to be the most important of the three.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Within the WP3, several researches at field scale will be carried out to investigate for the optimization of several irrigation variables using water resources of different salinity and quality. An other important issue of this WP will be to parameterize the simulation models about crop growth and photosynthesis translocation, soil water fluxes and solute transport. With the conclusive WP4, using the information deriving from previous WP, simulations will be effectuated at field and regional scale by using numerical models for simulating crops and cropping systems in order to evaluate the effects that the future climatic scenarios will have on crop yields and to individuate the best agronomical strategy to optimize the use of water resources.\n",

We hypothesize that forecasted changes in temperature, precipitation and growing season length will change the spatial pattern of growth dependencies of conifer forests; the null hypothesis is that we observe no significant changes in environmental growth dependencies between late 20th and late 21st century simulations.\n \nClimate model output will be coupled to a conifer tree growth model to produce high resolution maps of limiting growth dependencies over the late 20th and late 21st centuries. Climate model output will include, but will not be limited to, late 20th and 21st century simulations available on a 25Km resolution coterminous US grid from a fully coupled regional climate model cite[]{Diffenbaugh:etal2005}, itself nested within a global domain climate model cite[]{Atlas:etal2005} driven with standard IPCC scenario forcings.  Modeled daily temperature and precipitation will be used to drive the Vaganov-Shashkin (VS) model of conifer tree growth cite[]{Vaganov05} to calculate ring width and growing season length estimates.  Late 20th century climate model based tree-ring simulations will be validated using simulations based on high resolution gridded climate data and actual tree-ring width data cite[]{Evans:etal2006}.  Control and forecast simulation uncertainties will be assessed using Monte Carlo techniques to produce ensembles of climate model input and VS model output; uncertainties due to each modeling component will be evaluated.  Control and forecast results will then be quantitatively compared for biogeographic subregions to test the viability of the null hypothesis.",

These data will be used to develop an integrated ecosystem-atmosphere model that captures both slow and fast ecosystem processes. The combined results will provide quantitative constraints on the carbon budget at regional scales.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the stability of tropical sea surface temperature. Among them, the Ocean Dynamical Thermostat proposed by Clement et al (1996) relies on ocean dynamics to balance the radiative forcing over the tropical atmosphere. Following proposed mechanism an imposed heating induces increased upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean cooling the equatorial SST.\n\nThe IPCC AR4 multi-model dataset will be used to investigate the effect of the previously described thermostat mechanism on the response of the tropical climate due to increased CO2 forcing. An attempt to answer this question will be carried out by comparing compare increased CO2 experiments in coupled models (that have ocean dynamics) with atmosphere models coupled to a mixed layer ocean (no ocean dynamics).\n",

Investigation of large scale patterns of climate variability. \n\nWhile much focus on climate variability is associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Hemisphere extratropics has its own distinct patterns of variability. Of particular importance is the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) which is particularly robust \u2013 occurring in many climate models, even where ENSO is not captured \u2013 and has far reaching effects on the ocean and ice systems as well as regional climate. This has recently become an area of intense research, in particular as a robust trend in the characteristics of the SAM have become evident. Our work will investigate the response of the climate system to both variability and trends in the SAM. Continued research will also focus on the effect of the interaction between the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice systems in modulating the SAM.\n\nSen Gupta, A. and M. H. England (2006).

Coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback in hte Southern Annular Mode.  Journal of Climate, accepted with minor revisions. \n\n\n2. While the patterns of variability may be hemispheric in nature distinct regional effects are evident. Australia (and New Zealand) are within the domain of the SAM and as such a large part of the continental climate variability (including rainfall and temperatures) are likely influenced by the SAM. In addition other patterns of variability including ENSO and an Indian Ocean counterpart \u2013 the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)\u2013 will have a controlling effect over the continent. We will be investigating the mechanisms behind the variability and trends for both Australian and New Zealand rainfall and determine the associated predictability of extreme climate events. \n\n\n\n",

Using long-run climate change predictions from the Hadley 2 Model, the preferred estimates indicate that climate change will lead to a $1.3 billion (2002$) or 4.0% increase in annual profits. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -$0.5 billion to $3.1 billion and the impact is robust to a wide variety of specification checks, so large negative or positive effects are unlikely. There is considerable heterogeneity in the effect across the country with California~s predicted impact equal to -$0.75 billion (or nearly 15% of state agricultural profits). Further, the analysis indicates that the predicted increases in temperature and precipitation will have virtually no effect on yields among the most important crops, which suggest that the small effect on profits are not due to short-run price increases. The paper also implements the hedonic approach that is predominant in the previous literature and finds that it may be unreliable, because it produces estimates of the effect of climate change that are extremely sensitive to seemingly minor decisions about the appropriate control variables, sample and weighting. Overall, the findings contradict the popular view that climate change will have substantial negative welfare consequences for the US agricultural sector.\n",

The role of human activity in producing the observed water cycle changes will be assessed by evaluating IPCC model runs for the twentieth century that include various anthropogenic forcings.  Additionally, possible future changes in P-E and atmospheric moisture transport will be examined using IPCC 21st century simulations.

Early GCM modeling efforts (cf. Still et al 1999, Nature) predicted higher lifting condensation levels and reduced cloud contact for TMCFs as a consequence of increasing atmospheric CO2 and consequent global temperatures rise. Analysis of observational data also strongly suggests that warmer eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures [SSTs] are related to interannual decreases in cloud cover at Monteverde in Costa Rica, for instance, but that there also exists a longer-term trend of reduced moisture potentially related to anthropogenic forcings. Increases in global surface and tropical sea surface temperature may fundamentally alter the suite of climatic and biophysical conditions that create and maintain current cloud forests environments and their unique ecology.\n\nMy current dissertation research attempts to develop long-term reconstructions of local and regional climate variability in tropical montane cloud forests in order to better identify the relative contributions of various natural and anthropogenic influences on modern cloud forest climate.  As part of this research, I would like to examine the latest GCM results from AR4 in order to determine how state-of-the-art simulations perform in reproducing patterns of relative humidity, precipitation, and temperature in Central America, and also examine in detail both the natural and forced patterns of variability related to cloud forest hydroclimatology.\n\n",

The two models will specifically be evaluated by their ability to accurately reconstruct observed local daily precipitation and temperature variability and extremes. The models will be calibrated using observed station data for the period from 1961 to 1985, while the validation period will run from 1986 to 2000. Once calibrated, the GCM output from CGCM1 and HADCM3 will be downscaled using the models to generate future climate change scenarios for this region.\n",

Droughts in particular are any farmer\u2019s worst nightmare. A comprehensive study will be carried out in order to assess drought sensitivities to different oceanic and atmospheric variables. Since droughts can hit on different seasons, a discriminative, detailed analysis will be carried out. I will address how different regions, at different times of the year, are sensitive to different variables (or functions of them), in both the tropics and extratropics and using data from the SMIP and CMIP programs. Once those drought sensitivities are identified, several statistical forecast models for South American droughts will be constructed and an actual forecast will be issued for 2008-2009. In order to analyze these data and forecast droughts, I will use both standard and complex decomposition of covariance matrixes into their singular values and vectors (i.e., SVD analysis).\n",

Through this new approach, it will identify how changes in the climate will affect UK air transport and how those effects will sequentially influence the ways in which aviation contributes to further climate change. Additionally, it will identify the sensitivities of the mechanisms through which aviation contributes to climate change and identify the most significant ones for the UK region. The research will explore the climate impacts associated with the continuing growth in UK air transport, considering factors such as increased airspace congestion and increased use of regional airports. In addition, the research will analyze and propose policy options to mitigate the impact of air transport on climate change. This work will complement ongoing work by the research team which combines atmospheric data analysis and air traffic simulations to evaluate policies to mitigate the climate impacts of aviation.\n",

I am using models and simulations to explore the potential for coral communities to respond to a rapidly changing climate, potential indicators of coral communities most likely to survive future climate change, and the interaction between additional anthropogenic impacts and coral response to climate change.  These models will further the understanding of the interaction between evolutionary and ecological processes, inform conservation management decisions, and create a theoretical framework for synthesizing coral bleaching data.  \n",

Previous studies, which include both observations and simulations, have suggested that the TBO is likely an inherent mode of A-AM system surrounding the Indian Ocean basin but subjected to the influence of remote ENSO forcing. In view of monsoon prediction perspective, impacts of future climate change on this paradigm will have profound socioeconomic consequences. Understanding the ocean roles in the future warmer climate in affecting the monsoonal TBO phenomenon is therefore essential. The required WCRP CMIP3 datasets for thrusting into the proposed tasks are at least monthly-mean temporal resolution of rainfall, winds, specific humidity, temperature at various levels of troposphere, and heat flux terms at the air-sea interface and land surface, in addition to the sea surface temperatures.\n",

The working hypothesis is that seasonal climate predictability varies from decade to decade in conjunction with large-scale decadal-scale fluctuations in the principal modes of variability such as the NAO, PDO and NPO. Several scientists at COLA will be engaged in this evaluation, so we need to create a subset of the CMIP3 archive at COLA to optimize data transport. We have previously obtained a number of primarily atmospheric variables; we need to augment the local holdings at COLA with more ocean variables. The results will be reported in peer-reviewed publications, as appropriate, and the standard acknowledgment of PCMDI will be made for all uses of these data.\n",

            "abstract": "Deficiencies in the ability of GCM\u2019s to simulate surface temperature and precipitation in regions of complex terrain, such as the western United States, are well established. Since most of the winter snow pack tends to fall during a small number of storms, monthly and seasonally averaged climate statistics are not relevant. The goal of this study is to examine whether proxy synoptic indicators for the intensity of winter storms can be defined that will be less sensitive to the models\u2019 physical parameterizations of boundary layer processes in mountainous regions. \n\nThe first proxy to be tested will be daily 700 hPa temperature. 700 hPa temperature in numerical weather prediction models is used extensively by operational weather forecasters to assess whether precipitation in the valleys of the Intermountain West will fall as snow or rain. For mountain ranges such as the Utah Wasatch with peaks near 700 hPa, relatively warm 700 hPa temperature (near 0oC) during a storm cycle tends to be associated with higher water content. Obviously, using only mid-tropospheric temperature will not indicate whether precipitation is actually falling in the actual or simulated atmosphere.\n\nThe degree to which present climate simulations reproduce the probability density distribution of 700 mb temperature during the winter season in the western United States as deduced from radiosonde observations will be examined. Then, similar probability density distributions will be developed from GCM simulations using future climate scenarios (carbon dioxide doubling, etc.). After corrections for model biases, the utility of this and other synoptic proxies for inferring sensitivity of winter storm intensity to climate change scenarios will be addressed.\n",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean is a hot spot in climate change. The most striking climate change is the rapid regional warming at the Antarctic Peninsular. At Faraday/Vernadsky station in the western Antarctic Peninsular, surface air temperature exhibits a startling mean annual warming rate of 2.8\u00b0C over the last 50 years, contrasting the global mean warming rate of 0.5\u00b0C during the same period. It represents the highest rate of warming observed anywhere on earth. In responding to this warming, sea ice in the Southeast Pacific shows a significant decreasing trend, even though the sea ice extent over the entire Southern Ocean has a slightly increasing trend.  In the last 25 years, modern instrumental data reveal that the changes in El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode influence the sea ice variability in this region but cannot fully explain the trend in the Southeast Pacific sea ice extent. What caused this dramatic regional warming, and associated sea ice reduction, as well as the collapse of ice shelves around the peninsula is still an open question. We suspect that other climate modes in the Southern Ocean and/or combinations of different modes may play roles in this regional warming. Variability and interaction of different climate modes at longer timescales may also be important in this climate change. \n\nWe would like to examine the decadal variability in a number of major climate modes in the Southern Hemisphere from 100-150 years of coupled climate model runs. The Southern Annular Mode, marked by zonally-symmetric but out-of-phase pressure anomalies between mid and high latitudes, is a dominant climate mode throughout the Southern Hemisphere. This climate mode impacts the sea ice field, particularly in the South Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean. The Semi-annual oscillation describes another zonally-symmetric mode in the southern extra-tropics, which is characterized by the twice-yearly enhancement in meridional gradients of temperature and pressure fields. The atmospheric convergence line with a strong half-year cycle exerts significant influences on the seasonal asymmetric behavior of ice extent: a slow advance equatorward in winter and a fast retreat in summer. The Pacific South America pattern represents an atmospheric wave train in the pressure field over the South Pacific and South America. This mode is highly related to ENSO variability at the tropics and plays a critical role in the formation of the Antarctic Dipole, the largest interannual variability in sea ice and surface temperature in the Antarctic subpolar regions.\n\nThese climate modes collectively dominate the climate variability in the Southern Ocean. We have examined the relationships of these modes with sea ice based on the last 25 years of observations and have a good understanding of the influence from each mode on the sea ice field. The proposed study will extend our current study to longer periods from model runs, which will enable us to examine the climate variability at decadal and longer time scales, and their contributions to sea ice changes. The key objective is to isolate the unique combination of these modes that can cause a significant warming trend in the west Antarctic.\n\n",

            "abstract": "It is generally believed that our climate is changing and that the average temperatures will probably increase over the next few decades. What is less clear is \u201chow would temperature rise affect the designs and energy performance of buildings\u201d? Buildings account for a significant part of total energy use, up to nearly half in developed countries. In China, building stocks accounted for about 30% of the total primary energy requirement in early 2000s and, with rapid economic growth and improvements in the living standards, would continue to be a major energy end-user. Buildings last for 50 years or more. A good understanding of the impacts of climate change on the built environment is essential in the design and analysis of energy-efficient buildings, if these buildings are to maintain good thermal and energy performance well into the middle or even later half of this century. This work is to investigate the effects of temperature rise on the designs of buildings in different climate zones in China. Particular attention will be given to passive design strategies such as passive solar heating, natural ventilation, thermal mass and evaporative cooling. The findings would help architects and engineers make a more informed decision, especially during the initial conceptual design stage.\n\nIn China, there are five major climatic types - severe cold, cold, hot summer & cold winter, mild, and hot summer & warm winter. Because of the varying topology, there are nine regions \u2013 both the severe cold and cold climates have three regions. To strike a balance between keeping the analysis manageable and achieving a broad representation of the prevailing climate types in China, a total of 18 cities are selected for this study - five in the severe cold climate region, four cold, five hot summer & cold winter, one mild and three hot summer & warm winter. The criteria of selection are based on:\n\n1) Cities must have local meteorological stations and measured weather data such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, etc. are available.\n\n2) Cities selected should cover the major climatic types/categories identified, and have a reasonably even geographical distribution.\n\nTemperature has a direct impact on the thermal and energy performance of buildings, emphasis, therefore, will be on the availability of monthly temperature data (mean, minimum and maximum). The grid-box covering each of the 18 cities will be determined (initially, we would consider the 70o-140oE & 15o-55oN, the East Asia region data). Grid-box variables output from different GCMs will be downloaded and compared. Direct comparison may not be possible because these models tend to have different spatial/horizontal resolutions and varying modeling/prediction time-frames. The grid-box/grid-point data will be interpolated to achieve the predictions for the 18 cities using statistical method (e.g. Gradient plus Inverse-Distance-Squared). For each city, the interpolated data (mainly mean monthly mean, minimum and maximum dry-bulb temperatures) will be used to determine the 12 monthly climatic lines for the bioclimatic analysis of major design strategies. These will be compared with the bioclimatic design charts based on 30-year (1971-2000) long-term observed weather data. Impact on the potential of passive design strategies (e.g. passive solar heating and natural ventilation) will be assessed. We will try to quantify the impact with the likely changes in passive design potentials. For instance, passive solar design potential in Beijing is about 25% (i.e. 25% of the colder half of the year October-March, no conventional space heating will be required if proper passive solar design is adopted), temperature rise could increase the passive solar potential. Likewise, passive cooling design potential using natural ventilation and thermal mass techniques in Shanghai could be reduced due to warmer weather and more frequent extreme temperatures during the hot summer period. Due consideration will be given to the adaptive issue when constructing comfort zones on the bioclimatic charts.\n\n\n",

Specifically, the project will address the following question:\n\n1) How does the Northeast Pacific ocean circulation respond to global climate change? Specifically, how does coastal upwelling off the west coast of North America and eddy transport statistics change during global warming?\n\nSeveral ensembles of ROMS simulations (4 members in each ensemble) will be performed. Each member will be forced by downscaling surface fluxes (momentum, heat and freshwater) from selected outputs of the atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) used for the IPCC projections. The specific climate models used will be decided upon after a detailed analysis of the GCM outputs.  One ensemble will serve as the \"control\" and another will represent the \"future climate\".  \n\nThe focus of this project will be primarily on diagnosing the response to climate change of the upwelling cells along the NEP ocean boundary and the mesoscale eddy transport statistics. In particular, the project will be divided into two steps: (1) characterization of the changes and (2) diagnosis of the mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The model is being designed to evaluate many of the energy policies being considered in the western United States as well as how future climate may alter technology and policy options. The energy model is designed to identify strategies that can minimize cost of energy given a range of policy decisions, uncertainties of future technology performance and environmental constraints.  This current effort is being developed to examine several questions being posed in the Western United States;\n\n1) How would California\u2019s goals for Hydrogen Transportation Fuel affect the western region\u2019s refinery and electric generation system?\n\n2) How would potential climate and demographic changes constrain or improve the region\u2019s ability to generate electricity?  Which technologies will have advantages given expected climate conditions?\n\n3) How might western region energy policies affect the ability of the private sector to meet regional energy needs? \n\n4) What policies could be pursued in the near future to best position the energy system to meet long-term energy needs?  \n\nA unique aspect of this effort is the collaboration with the Technology Center of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). PG&E is a major gas and electric utility company strategically located in the western United States. Donald G. Price of PG&E, who is also a Participating Guest at LLNL, will coordinate PG&E participation on the project and provide technical review and support to the project Principal Manager (PM).\n",

The interaction between modern environment and land surface processes on the plateau induces a series of variations in the cryosphere, water resources and ecological system, which produce important influence on the human living circumstance and economic-society development on the plateau itself and periphery regions. This project possesses very important significance to the study of environmental changes on Tibetan Plateau and the contribution for international scientific frontier as well as local economics-society development. \n\nNumerical simulation is an important method to understand mechanisms of climate change. In this project, some numerical experiments were conducted by using a series of climate models. Based on the observation data over Tibetan Plateau, NCEP/ NCAR reanalysis data, ECMWF reanalysis data, the output data of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we will apply to compare and analyze variations of various climatic elements, such as surface air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, runoff, snowfall, snow depth and wind fields, to explain the reason and rules of the climate variability over the Tibetan Plateau and it\u2019s neighboring areas in recent fifty years.\n",

One of the focuses will be on resource scarcity and civil conflict as well as on \"preventative\" aid measures.\n\nA significant section will be devoted to examining the impact of climate change policies and climate change models/projections on crops and subsistence farming, as well as on the macroeconomies of different African countries. We hope to show the relationship between climate change, poverty, and the potential for violence as resources become scarce. The project is co-authored by Edward Miguel (UC Berkeley, Dept. of Economics) and Ray Fisman (Columbia University, Business School).\n\n",

In particular, tree cover is enhanced by the physiological effect over moisture-limited regions. Over Amazonia, South Africa, and Australia, the radiative forcing produces soil drying and reduced forest cover. A poleward shift of the boreal forest is simulated as both the radiative and physiological effects enhance vegetation growth in the northern tundra and the radiative effect induces drying and summertime heat stress on the central and southern boreal forest. Vegetation feedbacks substantially impact local temperature trends through changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. The physiological effect increases net biomass across most land areas, while the radiative effect results in an increase over the tundra and decrease over tropical forests and portions of the boreal forest.\n",

From earlier studies in this field by, for instance Fratantoni (2000, JGR), there are clear indications that in the case of a MOC breakdown there are major changes in the thermohaline structure in the equatorial Atlantic. This affects mainly the tropical upwelling regions which tend to disappear in the case of an MOC breakdown. However, the study builds on a simple regional ocean model and it remains unclear to what extent such heavy changes occur in more complex models.\n\nAs reported by the TAR and established the recent FAR the MOC reduces during the 21st century in  the mean by about 25%. I want to use the CMIP3 Data to investigate the resulting changes in the tropical Atlantic ocean in the different ocean models and climate change scenarios.\n",

A better understanding of the processes has emerged from the above observational studies and it has become clear that these large amplitude multidecadal fluctuations confound the calculation of climate trends. Separating the MDV and the anthropogenic influence on climate is essential for making future predictions. \n\nIn this project we propose to investigate the role of multidecadal variability and anthropogenic trends in IPCC CMIPIII models in the Arctic-North Atlantic Sector. Our observational analysis has revealed some intriguing relationships between the North Atlantic Oscillation and key climate parameters (Polyakova et al. 2006) in an attempt to understand why the NAO paradigm does not always operate. We have analyzed various simulations of the CCSM3 for multidecadal (Sterling, 2006) variability and propose to next analyze additional models from CMIPIII. This would provide us a better measure of which processes are well reproduced by current state-of-the-art models and strengths in one model would permit us to better understand the mechanisms behind what we see in observations. \n\nWe propose to begin the analysis using 20th Century and control simulations. Model spatial and temporal patterns of multi-decadal variability in the Atlantic and Arctic will be compared with our observational analysis. Mechanisms hypothesized from our previous observational work will be tested in the models. Additionally, future scenarios will be analyzed. \n",

Based on the surface energy budget, the sea surface temperature (SST) variance is related to the product of three factors: the sum of the variances of surface radiative and turbulent energy fluxes and of ocean heat transport, an efficiency factor depending on the covariances among them, and a transfer factor involving the persistence of surface temperature via its lagged autocorrelation (Yu and Boer, 2006, Clim. Dyn). These quantities have been analyzed based on results from the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and a simulation with the CCCma coupled climate model. It is found that the geographical distribution of the SST variance follows that of the sum of the variances of surface heat fluxes and the ocean heat transport, but modified by the defined efficiency and transfer factors.\n\nThe relationship between the SST and heat flux anomalies is complex and model dependent (e.g., WCRP, 2000). Therefore, the proposed project aims to further examine the above relationship between the SST and heat flux anomalies by using IPCC AR4 CGCMs\u2019 outputs, and to understand the physical processes associated with the relation.\n",

This relates to ecosystem services and includes the relationship between society, economy and biodiversity. In particular, risks arising from climate change, environmental chemicals, biological invasions and pollinator loss in the context of current and future European land use patterns will be assessed.\n\nThere is an increasing number of case studies on the environmental risks subsequent to each of these impacts. This yields an improved understanding on how these act individually and affect living systems. Whereas the knowledge on how they act in concert is poor and ALARM will be the first research initiative with the critical mass needed to deal with such aspects of combined impacts and their consequences.\n\nRisk assessments in ALARM will be hierarchical and examine a range of organisational (genes, species, ecosystems), temporal (seasonal, annual, decadal) and spatial scales (habitat, region, continent) determined by the appropriate resolution of current case studies and databases.\n\nSocio-economics as a cross-cutting theme will contribute to the integration of driver-specific risk assessment tools and methods and will develop instruments to communicate risks to biodiversity to end users, and indicate policy options to mitigate such risks.\n\n",

To this end open-source software for modeling species distributions will be developed and made available to the wider community. Novel approaches will also be developed to validate models using palaeoecological and palaeoclimate data. This projects constitutes: (i) the first large scale evaluation of climate change impacts on Latin American biodiversity; and (ii) the most comprehensive ensemble forecasting exercise done so far, using a large range of climate and bioclimate simulations.\n",

Almost all the models underestimate the dry season rainfall amount and the climate variability of rainfall in the 20th century.  The predicted changes in the future by these models are mainly determined by projected change of SSTs.\n\nThrough a comparison of observed and modeled data we plan to determine changes in climate trends due to anthropogenic activities.

The subpolar North Atlantic is freshening, while the subtropics of both hemispheres in the Atlantic are becoming saltier.  Likewise, there is some evidence that the western tropical Pacific is becoming fresher nearsurface.\n\nThese patterns of freshening and salinification are interesting for two reasons.  First, salinity is a state variable and thus any changes potentially affect the longterm circulation of the ocean.  Secondly,  salinity reflects the accumulated imbalance of the atmospheric hydrologic cycle and thus examination of changes allow us to infer information about longterm changes in the atmosphere.  \n\nIn this project I will examine the oceanic hydrologic cycle of the IPCC-type 20th century runs of the coupled models to explore the type of variability one  might expect in the historical record and the physical processes that lead to this variability.\n\n",

Previous model results show a decrease in low flow over the 21st century.  Using Latin Hypercube sampling of parameter estimates, the fractional change in low flow and the resulting change in TMDL of a point-source primary pollutant are estimated for GCM climate predictions; for most GCM climate predictions, a future reduction in contaminant load will be necessary to meet current water quality standards.\n",

The only known tiger habitat is under pressure from growing demand for natural resources which is further amplified by the rising threat of large and catastrophic fire occurrence.  The remotely sensed data driven Fire Threat Model (FTM) developed within this project provides a basis for spatially explicit quantitative assessment of likelihood of wildland fire occurrence, its impact and recovery potential for a given resource.  This model is intended for use by resource managers to assist them in assessing current levels of fire threat to a given resource, projecting the changes in fire threat under the changing climate and land use and evaluating the efficiency of various management approaches aimed at minimizing the fire impact.  During its first phase the project focused on evaluating the risk of ignition using MODIS active fire product.  Unlike fire behavior fire ignition is often connected with economic and cultural aspects of human presence as well as climatic conditions. The risk of ignition in the Russian Far East is highly variable in spatial and temporal domains and is strongly linked to anthropogenic activity (transportation routes, settlements and land use).  However, there is also an indication that during the largest fire seasons natural sources of ignition also contribute to increased fire occurrence.  In the next phases analyses leading to proper parameterization for the FTM will be undertaken to evaluate potential fire behavior, fire impact on the tiger, and the area\u2019s rehabilitation potential through remotely sensed data.  A set of potential scenarios of changes in fire threat associated with climate and land use change will provide a basis for long-term planning of the Amur tiger habitat protection.\n",

It has been argued that the PDO can be interpreted as arising through the excitation of ocean basin modes that are superimposed on a multidecadal modulation. This modulation is strongly time-lag correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Ocsillation (AMO). This analysis has suggested that the AMO and the multidecadal modulation of the PDO may be interpreted as two components in phase quadrature of the same oscillation cycle which has a period of approximately 60 years.\n\nWe would like to investigate the relationship of the PDO and the AMO in the different output of the CMIP3 archive, first in long control runs where a statistical equilibrium is reached, and then in forced global warming scenario runs.\n",

Several nonlinear techniques will be examined (multilayer perceptron neural networks, RBF neural networks, method of local linear models) and their ability to serve for implementation of transfer functions between predictors (reanalyses of climate variables and outputs of climate models) and predictands (temperature and precipitation at several Czech and European stations) will be evaluated. Aside from nonlinear downscaling techniques, attention will also be paid to possible application of nonlinear methods for filling in missing data in the existing time series, using the records from nearby stations as predictors. The outcomes of the project should contribute to the improvement of the results of statistical downscaling and to completion of the existing records.\n",

Increased ignition sources associated with growing human populations and expected changes in climatic conditions are likely to increase fire frequencies in shrubland watersheds, typical of MTEs, over the next century. The following general hypothesis is tested for chaparral watersheds in California: Changes in fire regime and climate will alter aggregate ecosystem conditions giving rise to modified long-term river flow characteristics.  The research hypothesis will be tested using an existing, physically based ecohydrological model (RHESSys) applied to two chaparral watersheds near Santa Barbara, California. The research project includes the following related components: 1) Time-space variations of shrub LAI during fire recovery are estimated from Landsat TM data and AVHRR data, 2) RHESSys is calibrated and evaluated using a bi-variate approach based on satellite-based estimates of LAI patterns and observed streamflow and 3) RHESSys is used to evaluate the impact of future fire and climate regimes on vegetation recovery and associated hydrologic response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Separate analyses will be carried out for the summer months and the winter months. Identify high-mortality and/or high air pollution weather types based on daily mortality counts and pollution levels. \n\nApply a linear discriminant function to daily data output from four models from the CMIP3 multi-model dataset, assigning each day in the years 1961-2000, 2046-2065 and 2081-2100 to an existing weather class defined using the NCEP reanalysis data. Four ICCP models will be used selected on the basis of which models are minimally biased and adequately capture the intra-annual and inter-annual variability in surface temperature, humidity, and sea-level pressure when compared to NCEP reanalysis data and interpolated weather station data. \n\nThe discriminate function\u2019s ability to identify high risk weather classes (using NCEP data as a proxy for the CMIP3 data) will be validated by applying the classification procedure to the 2001-2004 period which was not used to determine the discriminant linear functions but for which mortality and air pollution data are available.\n\nThe four 20-year periods (1961-1980, 1981-2000, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100) will be compared to determine how the character, the frequency of occurrence, or the persistence of high risk weather classes changes over time. The extent of these changes will be compared under different emissions scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1). Forecasts of weather and air-pollution related mortality will be made with the assumption that the weather-air pollution-mortality dose-response relationships will not change over time (i.e. no adaptation).\n\n\n\n",

The northern node of the NPO/WP imposes circulation anomalies over the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk and these circulation anomalies force both a dynamic and thermodynamic response of the marginal ice zone in these two seas.  The ice will drift at a 45 degree angle to the right of the wind and low level temperature advection will determine the southern limit of ice sustainability.  The observational analysis is almost complete and we hope to use the output of CAM3, the CAM3.5 and the CSIM5 to determine if the NPO/WP is present in the model atmosphere and if so, whether the modeled ice edge responds properly to atmospheric forcing associated with the NPO/WP.\n",

We are interested in attempting to parameterize this behavior in a very simple energy balance model in order to explore its implications for constraining climate sensitivity with observations, following Andronova and Schlesinger (2001), Forest et al (2002), Frame et al (2005), Hegerl et al (2006) et seq et seq et seq. \n\nTo do this, we need to compute effective sensitivity as a function of global mean temperature for the 2xCO2 and 4xCO2 simulations, requiring global mean temperature and net TOA flux data.\n\n",

            "abstract": "Climate modeling studies (Stouffer et al. 2006) have shown that there is a broad range of responses in the thermohaline circulation patterns due to both heat and freshwater changes on decadal scales. Gregory et al. (2005) suggests that surface heat fluxes are more responsible for the weakening of the thermohaline circulation than freshwater fluxes in a given set of climate models.  Understanding the predictability of the ocean and related changes to climate is tightly coupled to our understanding of the uncertainties associated with the processes in the atmosphere and the ocean of which ocean mixing and heat uptake are significant.  One metric, used in understanding the fundamental behavior of a climate model, is called the \"effective climate sensitivity\" and is defined as the equilibrium warming that would be expected based on model behavior at the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling.  Tightly related to this quantity is a metric that is used to understand a climate model~s ability to take up heat, the \"ocean heat uptake efficiency\" or ?, (Gregory and Mitchell 1997, Raper et al. 2002).  As these papers describe the relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean, the near surface air temperature change (??a?) relates to the net heat flux such that ?Q + ???a  = ?F, where ?Q is the net heat flux, ?  is the percentage of heat contributing to the atmospheric warming and ?F is the flux into the ocean. ?F can further be defined as d?H/dt.  ?H is the heat content change of the ocean and is equal to ???a, where ? is a coefficient related to the percentage of heat flux being added to the ocean the \"ocean heat uptake efficiency\" coefficient.  Thus ?Q = (? ? ?)??a.  The key objective of this proposal is to quantify ?  using observational data and compare it to similar quantities computed from AOGCMs to understand how its variability and spatial distribution influences the thermohaline circulation.\n\nWhile for climate studies the efficiency rate is used to understand the long term changes of the ocean and atmosphere that are associated with CO2 doubling; it could also be used as a measure to quantify the realism associated with heat uptake during 20th century runs of the current generation of climate models.   This research will be to calculate  quantities of ocean heat uptake efficiency from a set of the current generation IPCC AR4 models and simulations and evaluate their realism and the associated uncertainty in the uptake rates and compare the values to observational estimates.\n\n",

These changes, however, have a competing effect on the potential change in snowfall for the coming century. Using simulations performed with the GFDL CM2.1 coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model, the individual effects of temperature changes and precipitation changes are isolated and their interplay is examined with respect to changes in monthly snowfall in eastern North America. Results indicate that the effects of increased temperatures outweigh precipitation increases and are the dominant contribution toward negative monthly snowfall trends throughout the snowfall season in southern locations in the region of interest. The same mechanism is present during the fall and spring transition seasons at more northern regions, with the exception of mid-winter where increases in precipitation translate into positive monthly snowfall trends. Examination of 24-hour snowfall events in the northern regions reveals the coexistence of increasing numbers of large (> 20 cm) events and decreasing annual snowfall totals, thus indicating that precipitation increases at higher latitudes contribute to the possibility of larger snowfall events where it is sufficiently cold. The projected changes in precipitation are associated with a strengthening of the hydrologic cycle during the 21st century.\n",

            "abstract": "Together with changes in water withdrawal, changes in the availability of water resources due to global climate warming could also influence1 the world water resources stress situation. Here, we investigate how world water resources stress will likely change under scenarios presented by the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) with integrating the water withdrawal projections presented in the first part of this study. First, potential changes in water availability are investigated using a multi-model analysis of the ensemble outputs of six general circulation models (GCMs) from worldwide organisations. The analysis suggests that although climate warming might create greater availability of water resources, the amplitude of water resource change varies widely in some regions depending on the GCM used. The change predicted by the models was consistent for boreal regions of northern Canada and Siberia and tropical areas near the Equator. In most of Europe, the eastern U.S., and parts of South America, the six GCMs suggest significant to subtle changes in runoff. However, a significant decreasing trend in runoff due to climate warming is forecast for southern Europe. For other regions, the model results show large uncertainty in change amplitudes and even directions. Second, we investigated water-stressed basins, the number of people living in highly water-stressed basins, and changes in these categories using two indices (W/Q and Q/c) at the basin scale. Indices Q/c and W/Q indicate that approximately 1.75 billion and 2.53 billion people, respectively, currently live in highly water-stressed basins. These numbers will increase in the future and possibly double by the 2050s according to SRES scenarios A1b, A2, and B1. Finally, we examined the relative impacts of population growth, water use change, and climate warming on world water resources using the world highly water-stressed population as an overall indicator. The results suggest that population growth and socioeconomic development are the major causes of increasing stress on world water resources. Climate warming could mitigate world water stress to a limited extent. However, even though climate warming may create greater water availability, many basins worldwide will likely continue to experience water stress. Therefore, water use efficiency must be improved globally to reduce the net water withdrawal. A comparison of the world water-stressed population amongst different projections was also conducted in this paper.\n",

            "abstract": "Climate change and its mitigation are a big challenge for the current generation. Because of its borderless nature, the delay of the mitigation activity means increasing economic costs in the future for the entire world economy. Since \u201dclimate\u201d is a global public good, combatting the climate change needs a global framework such as the Kyoto-Protocol, and requires moreover active participation of all nations of the world. However, in absence of supra-national authority with a sanction function, overall participation could not be realized yet, because the incentives of free-riding prevail. To ensure effective implementation of a transnational climate policy, the global framework has to be complemented by regional frameworks against the backdrop of little incentives for the developing nations to participate actively in the global climate protection regime with binding commitment.\n\nEast Asia faces the challenge of incentive setting. Countries in the region have experienced extraordinary economic growth in the recent decades, and this rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasing energy consumption and environmental damages. In the meantime the impact of climate change has become visible. In the course of the current regionalisation in this area, the co-operation towards climate protection is now one of the central issues. Given these reasons, we lay regional focus on East Asian nations in this paper primarily concerning the roles of China, Korea and Japan and analyse the possibility and impact of establishing an environmental governance agreement with the objective of obligatory emission reduction goals. \n\nTo set incentives for environmental co-operation in the social dilemma situation, some possibilities have been discussed in the theoretical literature such as trade sanctions, which deter free-riding behaviour. Particular challenges to this region are the wide gap in the degree of economic development and the relative weakness of inter-governmental bodies. No institutions with sanction function exist. Therefore we put emphasis of this paper on the concept of equity, which has emerged in the context of inducing co-operation. Burden sharing depending on the individual capability enhances the acceptance of the agreement and hence promotes environmental co-operation. Thus, this concept is expected to play a key role in establishing the transnational cooperation framework and setting allocation of payments among industrialized and developing nations. In order to receive active support from the nations, the environmental governance has to be designed corresponding to their equity criteria. The purpose of this paper is to find out a feasible environmental regime by specifying appropriate equity criteria in the region of East Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For stratosphere, there is strong cooling in summer, and semi-annular patterns of warming in winter and spring as shown by Johanson, C.M. and Q. Fu [2007].\n\nMuch of the troposhperic cooling in summer and fall may be contributed by the strengthening of the SAM, but how much of the winter and spring warming is related to increases in greenhouse gases and/or changes in local circulations is remained to be unclear. Besides the large stratospheric warming occurring between June and November requires further investigation. \n\nTo understand the possible causes of such spatial trend patterns, it is instructive the produce the atmosphere temperature trend maps of Anarctic by the model outputs and compare it with the MSU and radiosonde results.\n\n",

We propose to examine the 3-hourly CMIP3 GCM output for thermal tides. If we find a tidal signal in the CMIP3 output, we will consider studying high-frequency GCM output archived by AMIP as well. The AMIP data includes 6-hourly wind velocity at 850 and 200 hPa levels as required fields, and at 50 hPa as an optional field. To the best of our knowledge, no other CMIP or AMIP projects have studied atmospheric tides.\n\nEarly observations revealed that the semi-diurnal component is a prominent part of the surface response even though it is generated primarily in the middle atmosphere. In addition to the presence of tides, the phase of the semidiurnal tide is a particularly interesting indicator. Climate-oriented GCMs traditionally concentrate on the lower atmosphere, with the stratosphere and higher levels poorly resolved, but many of the CMIP3 models extend up to or above the 1 hPa level and some may have adequate (~5 km) resolution in the stratosphere. We will see if these model characteristics correlate with the ability to simulate atmospheric tides.\n\nIf some GCM output does appear to give reasonable simulation of the tides, then we may want to entrain Aiguo Dai from NCAR into this project. A quick literature search implies that he wrote the definitive account of the diurnal and semidiurnal tide signals in observed global surface pressure fields (JAS 56: 3874, 2003). \n\nReferences:\n\nChapman, S. and R.

            "abstract": "Maintaining a multi-model database over a generation or more of model development provides an important framework for assessing model improvement. Using control integrations, we compare the simulation of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and its extratropical impact, in models developed for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report with models developed in the late 1990\u2019s (the so-called Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-2 [CMIP2] models). The IPCC models tend to be more realistic in representing the frequency with which ENSO occurs, and they are better at locating enhanced temperature variability over the eastern Pacific Ocean. When compared with reanalyses, the IPCC models have larger pattern correlations of tropical surface air temperature than do the CMIP2 models during the boreal winter peak phase of El Ni\u00f1o. However, for sea-level pressure and precipitation rate anomalies, a clear separation in performance between the two vintages of models is not as apparent. The strongest improvement occurs for the modelling groups whose CMIP2 model tended to have the lowest pattern correlations with observations. This has been checked by subsampling the multi-century IPCC simulations in a manner to be consistent with the single 80-year time segment available from CMIP2. Our results suggest that\nmulti-century integrations may be required to statistically assess model improvement of ENSO. The quality of the El Ni\u00f1o precipitation composite is directly related to the fidelity of the boreal winter precipitation\nclimatology, highlighting the importance of reducing systematic model error. Over North America distinct improvement of El Ni\u00f1o forced boreal winter surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and precipitation rate anomalies occurs in the IPCC models. This improvement is directly proportional to the skill of the tropical El Ni\u00f1o forced precipitation anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (coupled GCMs) with interactive sea ice are the primary tool for investigating possible future global warming and numerous other issues in climate science.  A long-standing problem with such models is that when different components of the physical climate system are linked together, the simulated climate can drift away from observation unless constrained by ad hoc adjustments to interface fluxes.  However, 11 modern coupled GCMs \u2014 including three that do not employ flux adjustments \u2014 behave much better in this respect than the older generation of models.  Surface temperature trends in control run simulations (with external climate forcing such as solar brightness and atmospheric carbon dioxide held constant) are small compared with observed trends, which include 20th century climate change due to both anthropogenic and natural factors.  Sea ice changes in the models are dominated by interannual variations.  Deep ocean temperature and salinity trends are small enough for model control runs to extend over 1000 simulated years or more, but trends in some regions, most notably the Arctic, differ substantially among the models and may be problematic.  Methods used to initialize coupled GCMs can mitigate climate drift but cannot eliminate it.  Lengthy \"control runs\" of models \u2014 made possible by increasing computer power \u2014 are one reason for the improvements this paper documents.",

            "abstract": "The ability of global coupled models to capture the ENSO-monsoon association is examined in the climate of the 20th century (20c3m) integrations submitted to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). For a proper representation of ENSO-monsoon relationship, we propose that a realistic simulation of the time-mean monsoon precipitation and evolution of sea surface temperature and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific during ENSO are essential.\n \nOf the 18 models examined here, only six are found to have realistic representation of monsoon precipitation climatology in the 20c3m integrations, and in the 2xC02 runs, all of them predict an increase (in the range 5-25%) in monsoon precipitation over the Indian sub-continent, as well as an increase in its variability (5-10%).\n\nFor each of these six models correlation statistics between all-India rainfall (AIR) index and SST over the tropical Indo-Pacific regions for each realization are calculated and then an ensemble mean pattern is computed. Only four models exhibit a robust ENSO-monsoon teleconnection pattern similar to observations, a feature that remains intact and stronger under the climate change scenario. As regards to the timing of the teleconnection, three models represent the observed spring predictability barrier, namely the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three model captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2-3 months after the summer monsoon. In the 20c3m and the 2xCO2 runs (1pctto2x) (1) the overall range and time scales of variation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship remain similar, and (2) there is little consistency in the phase among the individual realizations. Item (1) indicates that there is no evidence for a weakening in the ENSO-monsoon connection due to global warming, and item (2) suggests a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship. Further examination reveals that models that capture the ENSO-monsoon teleconnection have fidelity in correctly simulating the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies during El Nino events, lending credence to our hypothesis. The implication of these results on the monsoon prediction are discussed.",

We have separated the 'dynamic' and 'thermodynamic' components of the mean and extreme precipitation changes projected in 6 climate model experiments. The dynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric motion, while the thermodynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric moisture content. The model results consistently show that there are areas with small change or decreases in the thermodynamic change for mean precipitation mainly over subtropics, while the thermodynamic change for extreme precipitation is an overall increase as a result of increased atmospheric moisture. The dynamic changes play a secondary role in the difference between mean and extreme and are limited to lower latitudes. Over many parts of mid- to high latitudes, mean and extreme precipitation increase in comparable magnitude due to a comparable thermodynamic increase. ",

The shift of the storm tracks is accompanied by a poleward shift and upward expansion of the midlatitude baroclinic regions associated with enhanced warming in the tropical upper troposphere and increased tropopause height.  The poleward shift in baroclinicity is augmented in the Southern Hemisphere and partially offset in the Northern Hemisphere by changes in the surface meridional temperature gradient.  The poleward shift of the storm tracks also tends to be accompanied by poleward shifts in surface wind stress and precipitation, and a shift towards the high index state of the annular modes.

            "abstract": "Monthly and 3-hourly precipitation data from 20th century climate simulations by the newest generation of eighteen coupled climate system models are analyzed and compared with available observations. The characteristics examined include mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal to interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and the diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially MRI-CGCM2.3.2a, produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low-latitudes, in contrast to 45-65% in the TRMM satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local sea surface temperature (SST), which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm/day), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (>20 mm/day) precipitation and overestimate them for light (<10 mm/day) precipitation.  The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm/day category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America has intensity comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm/day) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in the new models, and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of world's coupled climate models.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean\u2019s Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water are two globally significant upper ocean water masses that circulate in all southern hemisphere subtropical gyres, and cross the equator to enter the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Simulations of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate water for the 20th century in eight climate models that provided their output in support of the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fourth Assessment report (IPCC AR4) have been compared to the commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Atlas of regional Seas. This study is the first step in a thorough analysis of climate model simulation of Southern Ocean water masses, involving both a comparison with observations and amongst the models. Significant model developments over recent years have resulted in a reasonable simulation of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate water in many models. Of particular interest is the generally better simulation of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate water in the southeast Pacific than in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Combined model and observational studies will help unravel the relative importance of the many suggest processes involved in Subantarctic Mode water and Antarctic Intermediate water formation at and between these two formation regions. A greater understanding of present-day biases in climate model simulations of Subantarctic Mode water and Antarctic Intermediate water will provide important knowledge in the assessment of the impact of these\nwater masses on climate under IPCC future forcing scenarios.",

            "title": "An assessment of the SST influence on surface wind stress in numerical weather prediction and climate models",
            "abstract": "We analyze the ability of six climate models to capture the observed coupling between SST and surface wind stress in the vicinity of strong midlatitude SST fronts. The analysis emphasizes air-sea interactions associated with ocean meanders in the eastward extensions of major western boundary current systems such as the Gulf Stream, Agulhas, and Kuroshio Currents.  Satellite observations of wind stress from the SeaWinds scatterometer on QuikSCAT and sea surface temperatures from AMSR clearly indicate the influence of SST on surface wind stress on scales smaller than about 30\u00ba of longitude by 10\u00ba of latitude. Spatially high pass filtered SST and wind stress variations are linearly related, with higher SST associated with higher wind stress.  The influence of SST on wind stress is also clearly identifiable in the ECMWF operational forecast model, having a grid resolution of 0.35 deg x 0.35 deg (T511). The coupling coefficient between wind stress and SST, as indicated by the slope of the linear least squares fit, is only half as strong as for satellite observations, however.  \n\nThe ability to simulate realistic air-sea interactions is present to varying degrees in the coupled climate models we examine. The MIROC 3-2-HIRES (1.1 deg x 1.1 deg, T106) and the NCAR CCSM3.0 (1.4 deg x 1.4 deg, T85) are the highest resolution models considered and produce the most realistic air-sea coupling associated with midlatitude current systems. Coupling coefficients between SST and wind stress in the MIROC3-2-HIRES and NCAR models are at least comparable to those in the ECMWF operational model. The spatial scales of midlatitude SST variations and SST-induced wind perturbations in the MIROC 3-2-HIRES model are comparable to those of satellite observations. The spatial scales of SST variability in the NCAR model are larger than those in the ECMWF model and satellite observations, and hence the spatial scales of SST-induced perturbations in the wind fields are larger. \n\nWe find that the ability of climate models to simulate air-sea interactions degrades with decreasing grid resolution.  SST anomalies in the GFDL CM2.0 (2.0 deg x 2.5 deg), UKMO HadCM3 (2.5 deg x 3.8 deg), and MIROC 3-2-MEDRES (2.8 deg x 2.8 deg, T42) models have larger spatial scales and are more geographically confined than in the higher resolution models. The GISS Model E-R (4.0 deg x 5.0 deg) is unable to resolve the midlatitude ocean eddies that produce prominent air-sea interaction.  Notably, the MIROC 3-2-MEDRES model exhibits much weaker coupling between wind stress and SST than the higher vertical and horizontal resolution version of the same model. The GFDL CM2.0 and UKMO HadCM3 models exhibit a linear relationship between SST and wind stress. However, coupling coefficients for the UKMO model are significantly weaker than in the GFDL and higher resolution models. In addition to model grid resolution (both vertical and horizontal), deficiencies in the parameterization of boundary layer processes may be responsible for some of these differences in air-sea coupling between models and observations.\n",

            "abstract": "A self-organising map is used to classify the winter circulation affecting southwest Western Australia (SWWA) into 20 different synoptic types. The changes in the frequency of these types and their links to observed rainfall are analysed to further understand the significant, prolonged, rainfall drop observed in this region since 1975. The temporal variability of the different synoptic types link well with the observed rainfall changes. The frequency of the troughs associated with wet conditions across SWWA has declined markedly since 1975 while the frequency of the synoptic types with high pressure over the continent, associated with dry conditions, has increased. Combining the frequency of the synoptic systems with the amount of observed rainfall allows a quantitative analysis of the rainfall decline. The decreased frequency of the troughs associated with very wet conditions accounts for half of the decline. Reductions in the amount of rainfall precipitating from each system also contribute to the decline. Large-scale circulation changes, including increases in the mean sea-level pressure and a decrease in the general baroclinicity of the region have been associated with the rainfall decline. These changes are suggested to be linked to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Due to the strong link between the number of trough types and the rainfall over SWWA, the shifts in the frequency of these synoptic types could be used as a tool to assess simulated rainfall changes, particularly into the future.\n",

            "title": "Projected future changes in synoptic systems influencing southwest Western Australia",
            "abstract": "Rainfall in the southwest of Western Australia (SWWA) is sensitive to shifts in the hemispheric scale circulation due to its location at the northward extent of the influence of mid-latitude fronts. A step-drop in the 1970s to a new winter rainfall regime has caused great concern for water users in the region. The synoptic systems at the height of winter in the latter half of the 20th century over this region have been described in Hope et al. (Clim Dyn, 2006) using a self-organising map, and in this study the projected future shifts in those systems has been examined. Bounds are placed on the possible responses by examining a number of different models and, into the future, two scenarios at the upper (SRES A2) and lower (SRES B1) limits of plausible human induced emissions. Rainfall taken directly from the models captures the rainfall decline in the 1970s, and, although it is not as large as observed in any one model, all the models express a decline, which is a very strong result. Into the future the rainfall decline is dramatic. The scenario at the upper bound of emissions, where atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise strongly, shows a rainfall decline right through to the end of the century. The shift in synoptic systems for most models is to far fewer troughs and more high pressure systems across the region. One model exhibits a different signature, with a shift to more systems with a zonal structure. The fact that there is a rainfall decline shown by all models, yet the synoptic changes are different, highlights how sensitive SWWA rainfall is to the different responses of climate models to increasing greenhouse gases. In the B1 scenario, the concentrations rise only slowly in the second half of the century and the shift is still to drier conditions, but it is not as striking. These results show that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases lead to increasingly dry conditions in SWWA, and as the atmospheric concentrations rise, the synoptic response intensifies.\n",

            "abstract": "The capability of reproducing observed surface air temperature (SAT) changes for the twentieth century is assessed using 22 multi-models which contribute to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. A Bayesian method is utilized for model evaluation by which model uncertainties are considered systematically. We provide a hierarchical analysis for global to sub-continental regions with two settings. First, regions of different size are evaluated separately at global, hemispheric, continental, and sub-continental scales. Second, the global SAT trend patterns are evaluated with gradual refinement of horizontal scales (higher dimensional analysis). Results show that models with natural plus anthropogenic forcing (MME_ALL) generally exhibit better skill than models with anthropogenic only forcing (MME_ANTH) at all spatial scales for different trend periods (entire twentieth century and its first and second halves). This confirms previous studies that suggest the important role of natural forcing. For the second half of the century, we found that MME_ANTH performs well compared to MME_ALL except for a few models with overestimated warming. This indicates not only major contributions of anthropogenic forcing over that period but also the applicability of both MMEs to observationally-constrained future predictions of climate changes. In addition, the skill-weighted averages with the Bayes factors [Bayesian model averaging (BMA)] show a general superiority over other error-based weighted averaging methods, suggesting a potential advantage of BMA for climate change predictions.

            "abstract": "A Bayesian approach is applied to the observed global surface air temperature (SAT) changes using multi-model ensembles (MMEs) of the IPCC AR4 simulations and single-model ensembles (SMEs) with the ECHO-G model. A Bayesian decision method is used as a tool for classifying observations into given scenarios (or hypotheses). The prior probability of the scenarios, which represents a degree of subjective belief in the scenarios, is changed into the posterior probability through the likelihood where observations enter, and the posterior is used as a decision function. In the identical-prior case the Bayes factor (or likelihood ratio) becomes a decision function and provides an observational evidence for each scenario against a predefined reference scenario. Four scenarios are used to explain observed SAT changes as 'CTL' (control or no change), 'Nat' (natural forcing induced change), 'GHG' (greenhouse-gas induced change), and 'All' (natural plus anthropogenic forcing induced change). Observed and simulated global mean SATs are decomposed into temporal components of overall mean, linear trend, and decadal variabilities through Legendre series expansions, coefficients of which are used as detection variables. Parameters (means and covariance matrices) needed to define the four scenarios are estimated from SMEs or MMEs. Taking the 'CTL' scenario as a reference one, application results for global mean SAT changes for the whole 20th century (1900-1999) show  decisive  evidence (logarithm of Bayes factor > 5) for the 'All' scenario only. While 'strong' evidences (log of Bayes factor > 2.5) for both 'Nat' and 'All' scenarios are found in SAT changes for the first half (1900- 1949), there is 'decisive' evidence for the 'All' scenario for SAT changes in the second half (1950-1999), supporting previous results. It is demonstrated that our Bayesian decision results for global mean SATs are largely insensitive to both inter-model uncertainties and prior probabilities.",

The Bayes factor or likelihood ratio of each model to the reference model (where mean is identical to the observation) provides a skill ranging from 0 to 1. Four categories of model skill are derived on the basis of the previous studies. Legendre series expansions are used to get a temporally refined model evaluation, which allow efficient analyses of time mean (scale) and linear trend. Application results show that all AOGCMs with natural plus anthropogenic forcing can simulate well the scale and trend of observed global mean SAT changes over the 20th century and its first and second halves. However, more than 50% of the models with anthropogenic forcing only cannot reproduce the observed warming reasonably. This indicates the important role of natural forcing although other factors like different climate sensitivity, forcing uncertainty, and a climate drift might be responsible for the discrepancy in anthropogenic-only models. Besides, Bayesian and conventional skill comparisons demonstrate that a skill-weighted average with the Bayes factors (Bayesian model averaging, BMA) overwhelms the arithmetic ensemble mean and three other weighted averages based on conventional statistics, illuminating future applicability of BMA to climate predictions.",

N and ALL scenarios are decided during the first half of the 20th century, but only in the low latitude region (Africa and South America), which might be related to response patterns to solar forcing. Overall seasonal decisions follow annual results, but there are notable seasonal dependences which differ between regions.

            "title": "Response of the East Asian summer monsoon to doubled atmospheric CO2: Coupled Climate Models simulations and Projections under IPCC AR4",
            "abstract": "      The East Asian (China, Korea and Japan) summer monsoon precipitation and its variability are examined from the outputs of the coupled climate models performing coordinated experiments leading to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). Out of the 22 models examined, 14 reproduce the observed shape of the annual cycle well with peak during the boreal summer (June through August), but with varying magnitude. Three models simulate the maximum a month later and with lower magnitudes. Only one model considerably underestimates the magnitude of the annual cycle. The remaining 4 models show some deviations from the observed. Models are unable to simulate the minimum in July with peaks in June and August associated with northward shifts of the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu precipitation band. The realistic simulation of the annual cycle does not appear to depend on the model resolution. The inter-model variation is slightly larger during summer, implying larger diversity of the models in simulating summer monsoon precipitation.\n\n      The spatial rainfall patterns are reasonably well simulated by most of the models, with several models able to simulate the precipitation associated with the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu frontal zone and that associated with the location of the subtropical high over the north Pacific. Simulated spatial distribution could be sensitive to model resolution as evidenced by two versions of MIROC3.2 model. The multi-model ensemble (MME) pattern reveals an underestimation of seasonal precipitation over the east coast of China, Korea-Japan peninsular and the adjoining oceanic regions. This may be related with the mass-flux based scheme employed for convective parameterization by majority of the models. Further the inter-model variation of precipitation is about 2 times stronger south of 300N, than north of this latitude, indicating larger diversity of the coupled models in simulating low latitude precipitation. The simulated inter-annual variability is estimated by computing the mean summer monsoon seasonal rainfall and the coefficient of variability (CV). In general the mean observed seasonal precipitation of 542 mm and CV of 6.7 % is very well simulated by most of the models. Except for one model mean seasonal precipitation varies from 400 to 650 mm. However the CV varies from 2 to 9 %. \n\n       Future projections under the radiative forcing of doubled CO2 scenario are examined for individual models and by the MME technique. Changes in mean precipitation and variability are tested by the t-test and F-ratio respectively to evaluate their statistical significance. The changes in mean precipitation vary from -0.6 % (CNRM-CM3) to about 14 % (ECHO-G; UKMO-HadCM3). The MME technique reveals an increase varying from 5 to 10 %, with an average of 7.8 % (greater than the observed CV of 6.7 %) over the East Asian region. However the increases are significant over the Korea-Japan peninsula and the adjoining north China region only. The increases may be attributed to the projected intensification of the subtropical high, Meiyu-Changma-Baiu frontal zone and the associated influx of moist air from the Pacific inland. The projected changes in the amount of precipitation are directly proportional to the projected changes in the strength of the subtropical high. Further the MME suggests a possible increase in the length of the summer monsoon precipitation period from late spring through early autumn. The changes in precipitation could be stabilized by controlling the CO2 emissions.\n\n",

            "abstract": "    The South Asian summer monsoon precipitation and its variability are examined from the simulated outputs of the coupled climate models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Out of the 22 models examined, 19 models are able to capture the maximum rainfall during the summer monsoon period (June through September) with varying amplitude. While 2 models are unable to reproduce the annual cycle well, one model is unable to simulate the summer monsoon season. The simulated inter-annual variability for the 19 models is examined with respect the mean precipitation, coefficient of variation, long-term trends and the biennial tendency. The model simulated mean precipitation varies from 500 mm to 900 mm and coefficient of variation from 3 to 13 %. While 7 models exhibit long-term trends, 8 models are able to simulate the biennial nature of the monsoon rainfall. Six models that generate the most realistic 20th century monsoon climate over South Asia are selected to examine future projections under the doubling CO2 scenario. \n       Projections reveal a significant increase in mean monsoon precipitation of 8 % and possible extension of the monsoon period based on the multi-model ensemble technique. Extreme excess and deficient monsoons are projected to intensify. The projected increase in precipitation could be attributed to the projected intensification of the heat low over northwest India, trough of low pressure over the Indo-Gangetic plains and the land-ocean pressure gradient during the establishment phase of the monsoon. The intensification of these pressure systems could be attributed to the decline in winter / spring snowfall. Besides a decrease of winter snowfall over western Eurasia models also project an increase of winter snowfall over Siberia/eastern Eurasia. This projected dipole snow configuration during winter could imply changes in mid-latitude circulation conducive for subsequent summer monsoon precipitation activity. Increase in precipitable water of 12-16 % is projected over major parts of India. However maximum increase of about 20-24 % is projected over the Arabian Peninsula, adjoining regions of Pakistan, northwest India and Nepal. Though the projected summer monsoon circulation appears to weaken, the projected flow over the Bay of Bengal (Arabian Sea) will support oceanic moisture convergence towards the southern parts of India and Sri Lanka (northwest India and adjoining regions). ENSO-Monsoon relationship is projected to weaken. \n",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Changes in Arctic sea ice cover have the potential to impact \nmidlatitude climate. A previous sensitivity study utilizing the National Center \nfor Atmospheric Research\u2019s (NCAR) atmospheric general circulation model \n[AGCM; Community Climate Model, version 3 (CCM3)] to explore climate \nsensitivity to declining Arctic sea ice cover suggested that, as Arctic sea ice \ncover is reduced, precipitation patterns over western North America will shift \ntoward dryer conditions in southwestern North America and wetter conditions \nin northwestern North America. Here, three complementary lines of research \nvalidate and explore the robustness of this possible climate change impact: 1) \nrepetition of the previous sensitivity study (specified constant Arctic sea ice \ncover and atmospheric CO2) with an updated version of the NCAR AGCM \n[third Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3)], 2) investigation of the climate \nresponse to dynamically reduced Arctic sea ice cover (driven by a quadrupling \nof atmospheric CO2) in the coupled NCAR Community Climate System Model\n(CCSMv3), and 3) analysis of similar results from six other coupled climate \nsystem models. Results from the CAM3 sensitivity study are similar to those \nfrom the original study with declining Arctic sea ice cover driving up to 25% \nless mean annual precipitation (MAP) over southwestern North America and \nup to an 8% increase in MAP over northwestern North America. The seven \ncoupled models also reproduce this same general pattern. At the time of CO2 \nquadrupling, Arctic sea ice cover is reduced (up to 90% in boreal winter) and \nMAP over southwestern North America decreases by up to 30% while MAP in \nnorthwestern North America increases by up to 40%. These results represent a \nsignificant shift in the precipitation pattern over western North America and \nsupport the findings of the original sensitivity study in suggesting that, as future \nreductions in Arctic sea ice cover take place, there will be a substantial impact \non water resources in western North America. \n",

In this study an extreme temperature is defined as lying above the 95 percentile of the simulated temperature distribution for 20th Century climate.\n\nThe model probability of extreme warm seasons is heterogeneous over the globe and rises to over 90% in large parts of the tropics. This would correspond to an average return period of such anomalous warm seasons of almost one year. The reliability of these results is assessed using the bounding box technique, previously used to quantify the reliability of seasonal climate forecasts. It is shown that the dramatic increase in extreme warm seasons arises from the combined effect of a shift and a broadening of the temperature distributions. ",

Forcings and feedbacks that impact the warming response are estimated for both Arctic and global regions based on standard model diagnostics. Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks. Contributing to Arctic amplification are the Arctic-global differences in surface albedo feedback (SAF), longwave feedback and the net top-of-atmosphere flux forcing (the sum of the surface flux and the atmospheric heat transport convergence). The doubled CO2 forcing and non-SAF shortwave feedback oppose Arctic amplification. SAF is shown to be a contributing, but not a dominating, factor in the simulated Arctic amplification and its intermodel variation.",

Compared to 2xCO2 equilibrium run estimates from an earlier group of models, both the mean SAF and the standard deviation are reduced.  Three quarters of the model mean SAF comes from the northern hemisphere in roughly equal parts from the land and ocean areas.  The remainder is due to southern hemisphere ocean areas.

The model simulations were conducted in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report. The analysis demonstrates the utility of SOMs for climate analysis, both as a tool to evaluate the accuracy of climate model predictions, and to provide a useful alternative view of future climate change. \nIt is found that not all models accurately simulate the frequency of occurrence of Arctic circulation patterns. Some of the models tend to overpredict strong high pressure patterns while other models overpredict the intensity of cyclonic circulation regimes. In general the ensemble of models predicts an increase in cyclonically dominated circulation patterns during both the winter and summer seasons, with the largest changes occurring during the first half of the 21st century. Analysis of temperature and precipitation anomalies associated with the different circulation patterns reveals coherent patterns that are consistent with the different circulation regimes and highlight the dependence of local changes in these quantities to changes in the synoptic scale circulation patterns. \n",

            "abstract": "An analysis of late 20th century and 21st century predictions of Antarctic circulation patterns in a ten model ensemble of global climate system models, using the method of self-organizing maps (SOMs), is presented. The model simulations, and this analysis, were conducted in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report. An application of the methodology to 20th century reanalyses resulted in conclusions congruent with earlier synoptic climatologies that used different techniques. It was found that the SOM methodology is a useful tool for diagnosing differences among a large cohort of often quite divergent simulations, allowing the rapid identification of outliers. \n\nSome models do rather poorly at simulating the present day Antarctic circulation, but taking these outliers into account and considering the models as an ensemble, the simulations of 20th century circulation are reasonable. The most notable outlier was the Centre National de Recherches M\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques model (also known as ARPEGE), which was unable to simulate Southern Ocean cyclones. Also of interest was the excessive cyclogenesis displayed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research CCSM3 model. \n\nThe trend to increasing cyclonicity and stronger zonal winds is quite consistent among models, and is reflected also in an increase in positive Antarctic Oscillation index. The coherence of temperature and precipitation anomaly patterns and their trends reflects the extent to which these are related to circulation. It is clear from this analysis that several of the models in this ensemble are capable of predicting the Antarctic Peninsula warming as the rest of the continent cools \u2013 this is an important advance in our simulation capacity.\n\n",

This analysis builds on a prior study of humidity and surface temperature measurements that suggested an overall positive climate feedback by water vapor in the tropical upper troposphere, whereby the mean specific humidity increases with warmer sea surface temperature (SST). The model results for present-day simulations show a large range in mean humidity, mean air temperature, and mean SST, but they consistently show increases in upper tropospheric specific humidity with warmer SST.  The model average increase in water vapor at 250 mb with convective mean SST is 44 ppmv per K, with a standard deviation of 14 ppmv per K.  Furthermore, the implied feedback in the models is not as strong as would be the case if relative humidity remained constant in the upper troposphere.  The model mean decrease in relative humidity is -2.3+-1.0 % per K at 250 mb, whereas observations indicate decreases of -4.8+-1.7 % per K near 215 mb.  These two values agree within the respective ranges of uncertainty, indicating that current global climate models are simulating with reasonable accuracy the observed behavior of water vapor\nin the tropical upper troposphere.\n",

            "abstract": "An EOF analysis is used to intercompare the response of ENSO-like variability to CO2 doubling in results from 15 coupled climate models assembled for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.  Under pre-industrial conditions, 12 of the 15 models exhibit ENSO amplitudes comparable to or exceeding that observed in the second half of the 20th century.  Under CO2 doubling, three of the models exhibit statistically significant (p<0.1) increases in ENSO amplitude, and five exhibit significant decreases. The overall amplitude changes are not strongly related to  the magnitude or pattern of surface warming. It is, however, found that ENSO amplitude decreases (increases) in models having a narrow (wide) ENSO zonal wind stress response and ENSO amplitude comparable to or greater than observed.   The models exhibit a mean fractional decrease in ENSO period of about 5%.  Although many factors can influence ENSO period, it is suggested that this may be related to a comparable increase in equatorial wave speed through an associated speedup of delayed-oscillator feedback. Changes in leading EOF, characterized in many of the models by a relative increase in the amplitude of SST variations in the central Pacific, are in most cases consistent with effects of anomalous zonal and vertical advection resulting from warming-induced changes in SST.",

The poleward shift, along with a significant increase in the transport of water around Antarctica, is predicted to continue into the future. To appreciate the magnitude of the poleward shift we note that by century's end the concomitant shrinking of the Southern Ocean is predicted to displace a volume of water close to that in the entire Arctic Ocean.  A simple theory, balancing surface Ekman drift and ocean eddy mixing, explains these changes as the oceanic response to changing wind stress.",

Changes in the zonal circulation of the ocean in the region are broadly consistent with the changes in zonal wind stress. In particular, the climate models simulate a strengthening and a poleward shift of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  The strengthening of the zonal wind stress also results in intensifying northward Ekman transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which, in the unblocked latitudes of Drake Passage, implies increasing southward geostrophic transport in the ocean below about 2000 m.  Zonal wind stress changes such as these may be expected to enhance the meso-scale eddy activity in the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we use existing observational datasets to evaluate 20th century climate simulations of the tropical Pacific. The emphasis of our work is decadal variability of the shallow meridional overturning circulation, which links the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. In observations, this circulation is characterized by equatorward geostrophic volume transport convergence in the interior ocean pycnocline across 9$^{\\\\circ}$N and 9$^{\\\\circ}$S. Historical hydrographic data indicate that there has been a decreasing trend in this convergence over the period 1953-2001 of about 11 Sverdrup (1 Sv=10$^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$), with maximum decade-to-decade variations of 7-11 Sv. The transport time series is highly anti-correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, implying that variations in meridional overturning circulation are directly linked to decadal variability and trends in tropical SST. These relationships are explored in 18 model simulations of 20th century climate from 14 state-of-the-art coupled climate models. Significant correlation exists between meridional volume transport convergence and tropical SST in the majority of the models over the last half century. However, the magnitude of transport variability on decadal time scales in the models is underestimated while at the same time modeled SST variations are more sensitive to that transport variability than in the observations. The effects of the meridional overturning circulation on SST trends in most the models is less clear. Most models show no trend in meridional transport convergence and underestimate the trend in eastern tropical Pacific SST. The eddy permitting MIROCH model is the only model that reasonably reproduces the observed trends in transport convergence, tropical Pacific SST, and SST gradient along the equator over the last half century. If the observed trends and those simulated in the MIROCH model are ultimately related to greenhouse gas forcing, these results suggest that the Bjerknes feedback, by affecting pycnocline transport convergences, may enhance warming that arises from anthropogenic forcing in the eastern tropical Pacific.",

Analysis of the thermodynamic structure also shows significant discrepancies between models and reanalyses, the former show warming aloft and increased static stability while the latter show a cooling trend and decreased static stability in the tropical mid-troposphere. Additional energy balance analysis reveals that models and reanalyses have a fundamentally different balance between diabatic heating, circulation and thermodynamic structure over the period 1979 \u2013 2000.

Only a few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of warming (cooling) during 1901-1940 (1940-1979).  Those models with multiple runs (identical forcing but different initial conditions) showed considerable intra-model variability with trends varying by up to 1.8\u00b0C/century, suggesting that the historical forcings did not produce consistent trends while internal dynamic variability played a major role at the regional scale.  The wide range of trend outcomes, particularly for those models with multiple runs, and the small number of simulations similar to observations in both the forced and unforced experiments suggest that the warming hole is not a robust response to the estimated external forcings; a more likely explanation is an unusually large realization of internal dynamic variability combined with external forcing.  \nThe observed CUS temperature variations are positively correlated with north Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and both NA SSTs and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs.  Most models simulate rather well the connection between CUS temperature and NA SSTs.  However, the teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between CEP SSTs and CUS temperature are poorly simulated and the models produce substantially less NA SST variability than observed, perhaps hampering their ability to reproduce the warming hole.   \n\n",

However, the point-wise ensemble mean of all the models usually shows better statistical  agreement with the  observations than does any single model.

In order to reduce model bias and uncertainty, a weighted ensemble mean (WEM) is used for multi-model projections. Although it is difficult to reproduce the present river discharge in any single model, the WEM results produce more accurate reproduction for most rivers, except those affected by anthropogenic water usage. At the end of the 21st century, the annual mean precipitation, evaporation, and runoff increase in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, southern to eastern Asia and central Africa. In contrast, they decrease in the Mediterranean region, southern Africa, and southern North America. Although the geographical distribution of the changes in precipitation and runoff tends to coincide with that in the river discharge, it should be emphasized that the change in runoff at the upstream region affects the river flow in the downstream region. In high-latitude rivers (Amur, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob, Yenisei, and Yukon), the discharge increases, and the peak timing shifts earlier due to an earlier snowmelt caused by global warming. Discharge tends to decrease for the rivers in Europe to the Mediterranean region (Danube, Euphrates, and Rhine), and southern North America (Rio Grande).",

It is revealed that a delay in early summer rain withdrawal over the region extending from Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands to the south of Japan around Japan is contrasted with an earlier withdrawal over southern Chinathe Yangtze Basin, although the latter is not significant due to inconsistent sign of changes among the models. Higher mean sea-level pressure anomalies in the tropical western Pacific in the future may be related to these late withdrawals.

            "abstract": "The relationships between the natural variability and CO2-induced response over the Pacific region are investigated in terms of the spatial anomaly pattern of SST, sea level pressure and precipitation by a multi-model intercomparison analysis based on the 18-model results contributing to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The analysis indicates that the CO2-induced response pattern is related with the model natural variability modes, ENSO and AO. In the tropical Pacific, an ENSO-like global warming pattern is simulated by the majority of the models with mostly El Ni\u00f1o-like change. In the Arctic region, an AO-like global warming pattern is simulated by many models, with the positive definite AO-phase change if AO-like. It is suggested that the increase in meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere provides a preferable condition for the positive AO-like change in the high latitudes by intensifying the subtropical jet, while the increase in the static stability provides a preferable condition for the El Ni\u00f1o-like change in the low latitudes by reducing the large-scale ambient circulations. However, the sign of the mass (SLP) anomaly is incompatible over the North Pacific between the positive AO-like change and the El Ni\u00f1o-like change. As a result, the present models cannot fully determine the relative importance between the mechanisms inducing the positive AO-like change and inducing the ENSO-like change, leading to scatter in global warming patterns in regional scales over the North Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Given the strong natural variability of precipitation, detection of anthropogenic climate change has been mainly based on surface thermal indicators. It is here argued that precipitation variability, whatever its natural or anthropogenic origin, is likely to affect surface temperature and, thereby, to hamper the detection-attribution of climate change at the regional scale. This issue is illustrated over Sudan and Sahel using the outputs of eleven coupled general circulation models having participated in the latest IPCC simulations. Like in situ observations, models show a strong relationship between detrended seasonal anomalies of surface air temperature and precipitation during the summer monsoon season. Linear regressions are then used to remove the precipitation influence on observed and simulated linear trends in surface air temperature. The results indicate that this strategy is efficient to reduce the spread in the simulated surface warming and make it more consistent with the instrumental record over recent decades.",

            "abstract": "In many parts of the world, climate projections for the next century depend on potential changes in the properties of the El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The current staus of these projections is assessed by examining a large set of climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Firstly, the patterns and time series of present-day ENSO-like model variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean are compared with that observed. Next, the strength of the coupled atmosphere-ocean feedback loops responsible for generating the ENSO cycle in the models are evaluated. Finally, we consider the projections of the models with, what we consider to be, the most realistic ENSO variability. \n\nTwo of the models considered do not have interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Three models show a very regular ENSO cycle due to a strong local wind feedback in the central Pacific and weak sea surface temperature (SST) damping. Six other models have a higher frequency ENSO cycle than observed due to a weak east Pacific upwelling feedback loop. One model has much stronger upwelling feedback than observed, and another one cannot be described simply by the analysis technique. The remaining six models have a reasonable balance of feedback mechanisms and in four of these the interannual mode also resembles the observed ENSO both spatially and temporally. \n\nOver the period 2051-2100 (under various scenarios) the most realistic six models show either no change in the mean state or a slight shift towards El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions with an amplitude at most a quarter of the present day interannual standard deviation. We see no statistically significant changes in amplitude of ENSO variability in the future, with changes in the standard deviation of a Southern Oscillation Index that are no larger than observed decadal variations. Uncertainties in the skewness of the variability are too large to make any statements about the future relative strength of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events. Based on this analysis of the multi-model ensemble, we expect very little influence of global warming on ENSO. \n\n",

            "abstract": "Ensembles of coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean global circulation model simulations are required to make probabilistic predictions of future climate change. \u201cPerturbed physics\u201d ensembles provide a new approach in which modelling uncertainties are sampled systematically by perturbing uncertain parameters. The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20 year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5\u20132.6\u00b0C, similar to that found in multi-model studies. Measures of global and large scale climate change from the coupled models show simple relationships with associated measures computed from atmosphere-mixed-layer-ocean climate change experiments, suggesting that recent advances in computing the probability density function of climate change under equilibrium conditions using the perturbed physics approach may be extended to the transient case. \n",

            "abstract": "Climate model output is used to analyze the behavior of extreme cold-air outbreaks (CAOs) under recent and future climatic conditions.  The study uses daily output from seven GCMs run under late 20th century and projected 21st century radiative conditions (SRES A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario).  We define a CAO as an occurrence of two or more consecutive days during which the local mean daily surface air temperature is at least two standard deviations below the local wintertime mean temperature.  In agreement with observations, the models generally simulate modern CAOs most frequently over western North America and Europe and least commonly over the Arctic.  These favored regions for CAOs are located downstream from preferred locations of atmospheric blocking.  Future projections indicate that CAOs\u2014defined with respect to late 20th century climatic conditions\u2014decline in frequency by 50 to 100% in most of the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century.  Certain regions, however, show relatively small changes and others actually experience more CAOs in the future, due to atmospheric circulation changes and internal variability that counter the thermodynamic tendency from greenhouse forcing.  These areas generally experience greater near-surface wind flow from the north or of more continental origin during the 21st century and/or are especially prone to atmospheric blocking events.  Simulated reductions in CAOs are smallest in western North America, the North Atlantic, and in southern regions of Europe and Asia.  The Eurasian pattern is driven by a strong tendency for the models to produce SLP increases in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea (intermodel mean of 3 hPa), causing greater advection of continental air from northern and central Asia, while the muted change over western North America is due to enhanced ridging along the west coast and the increased frequency of blocking events.  The North Atlantic response is consistent with a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, which either damps the warming regionally or results in a cooler mean climate in the vicinity of Greenland.",

Five of the eleven models predict an increase of annual rainfall, three models predict a decrease of rainfall, and the other three models predict no significant changes in the Amazon rainfall.  We have further examined two models.  The UKMO-HadCM3 model predicts an El Ni\u00f1o-like sea surface temperature (SST) change and warming in the northern tropical Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the Amazon.  The resultant increase of surface solar absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the surface air.  These changes decrease the rate and length of wet season rainfall and surface latent heat flux.  This decreased wet season rainfall leads to drier soil during the subsequent dry season, which in turn can delay the transition from the dry to wet season.   \n     GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming in the western Pacific and the southern tropical Atlantic which increases moisture transport and hence rainfall in the Amazon.  In the southern Amazon and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and transition season and leads to an earlier wet season onset.   \n",

            "abstract": "The radiative effects from increased concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) represent the most significant and best understood anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. The most comprehensive tools for simulating past and future climates influenced by WMGHGs are fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Because of the importance of WMGHGs as forcing agents, it is essential that AOGCMs compute the radiative forcing by these gases as accurately as possible. We present the results of a Radiative-Transfer Model Intercomparison (RTMIP) between the forcings computed by the radiative parameterizations of AOGCMs and by benchmark line-by-line (LBL) codes. The comparison is focused on forcing by CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, and the increased H2O expected in warmer climates. The models included in the intercomparison include several LBL codes and most of the global models submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4). In general, the LBL models are in excellent agreement with each other. However, in many cases, there are substantial discrepancies among the AOGCMs and between the AOGCMs and LBL codes. In some cases this is because the AOGCMs neglect particular absorbers, in particular the near-infrared effects of CH4 and N2O, while in others it is due to the methods for modeling the radiative processes. The biases in the AOGCM forcings are generally largest at the surface level. We quantify these differences and discuss the implications for interpreting variations in forcing and response across the multi-model ensemble of AOGCM simulations assembled for the IPCC AR4.",

The broad success in\nmodeling ENSO\u2019s SST-footprint \u2013 quite realistic in CCSM3 \u2013 is however tempered by the difficulties in modeling ENSO evolution: Biennial oscillation in CCSM3, and no regular warm-to-cold phase transition in the MIROC model. The spatio-temporal structure, including seasonal phaselocking, is on the whole, well modeled by HADCM3; but there is room for improvement, notably, in modeling the SST foot-print in the western Pacific.\nENSO precipitation anomalies over the tropical Pacific and links to North American winter precipitation are also realistic in the HADCM3 simulation; and, to an extent, in PCM. Hydroclimate teleconnections that lean on stationary component of the flow, such as surface air temperature\nlinks, are however not well modeled by HADCM3 since the midlatitude ridge in the ENSO response is incorrectly placed in the simulation; PCM fares better.\nThe analysis reveals that climate models are improving but still unable to simulate many features of ENSO variability and its circulation and hydroclimate teleconnections to North America.

Enhanced moisture transport over the Asian summer monsoon region, associated with the increased moisture source from the warmer Indian Ocean, leads to a larger moisture flux convergence, which is responsible for the intensification of the mean rainfall. Pronounced warming over the tropics in the middle-to-upper troposphere causes a reduction in the meridional thermal gradient in the Asian region, which is consistent with the weakened monsoon circulation and eastward shift of the Walker circulation.

            "abstract": " In many parts of the world, climate projections for the next century depend on potential changes in the properties of the El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The current staus of these projections is assessed by examining a large set of climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Firstly, the patterns and time series of present-day ENSO-like model variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean are compared with that observed. Next, the strength of the coupled atmosphere-ocean feedback loops responsible for generating the ENSO cycle in the models are evaluated. Finally, we consider the projections of the models with, what we consider to be, the most realistic ENSO variability.\n\nTwo of the models considered do not have interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Three models show a very regular ENSO cycle due to a strong local wind feedback in the central Pacific and weak sea surface temperature (SST) damping. Six other models have a higher frequency ENSO cycle than observed due to a weak east Pacific upwelling feedback loop. One model has much stronger upwelling feedback than observed, and another one cannot be described simply by the analysis technique. The remaining six models have a reasonable balance of feedback mechanisms and in four of these the interannual mode also resembles the observed ENSO both spatially and temporally.\n\nOver the period 2051-2100 (under various scenarios) the most realistic six models show either no change in the mean state or a slight shift towards El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions with an amplitude at most a quarter of the present day interannual standard deviation. We see no statistically significant changes in amplitude of ENSO variability in the future, with changes in the standard deviation of a Southern Oscillation Index that are no larger than observed decadal variations. Uncertainties in the skewness of the variability are too large to make any statements about the future relative strength of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events. Based on this analysis of the multi-model ensemble, we expect very little influence of global warming on ENSO. ",

            "abstract": "We compare for the overlapping time frame 1962-2000 the representation of the northern hemisphere mid-latitude winter atmospheric variability of the available XX century simulations of GCMs included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2013 4th Assessment Report with the reanalyses of NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF. We adopt the classical approach of computing the Hayashi spectra of the 500hPa geopotential height fields and we introduce an ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral sub-domains. The total wave variability is taken as a global scalar metrics describing the overall performance of each model, while the total variability pertaining to the eastward propagating baroclinic waves and to the planetary waves are taken as scalar metrics describing the performance of each model in describing the corresponding specific physical process. We obtain that large biases, in most cases larger than 20%, are found in all the considered metrics between the wave climatologies of most IPCC models and the reanalises. The span of the climatologies of the various models is in all cases over 50% of the climatology of the reanalises. In particular, the baroclinic waves are typically overestimated by the climate models, while the planetary waves are usually underestimated. This closely resembles the results of many diagnostic studies performed in the past on global weather forecasting models. The vertical resolution of the atmosphere and, somewhat unexpectedly, of the adopted ocean model seem to be critical in determining the agreement of the climate models with the reanalyses. This study suggests a serious caveat in the ability of most of the presently available climate models in describing the statistical properties of the global scale atmospheric dynamics of the present climate, and, a fortiori, in the perspective of climate change.\n(Email: valerio.lucarini@unicam.it)",

            "abstract": "The quality of global sea level pressure patterns has been assessed for simulations by 23 coupled climate models. Many models showed serious large-scale deficiencies in the simulated patterns, especially at mid-latitudes. Five models performed well at all latitudes and for each month of the year. Three models had a reasonable skill.\n\nWe selected the five models with the best pressure patterns for a more detailed assessment of their simulations of the climate in Central Europe. We analysed observations and simulations of monthly mean geostrophic flow indices and of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. We used three geostrophic flow indices: the west component and south component of the geostrophic wind at the surface and the geostrophic vorticity. We found that circulation biases were important, and affected precipitation in particular. Apart from these circulation biases, the models show other biases in temperature and precipitation, which were for some models larger than the circulation induced biases. Despite these deficiencies, the models do simulate many aspects of the observed climate quite well.\n\nFor the 21st century the models simulated quite different changes in circulation, precipitation and temperature. Precipitation changes appear to be primarily caused by circulation changes. Since the models show widely different circulation changes, especially in late summer, precipitation changes vary widely between the models as well. Some models simulate severe drying in late summer, while one model simulates significant precipitation increases in late summer. With respect to the mean temperature the circulation changes were important, but not dominant. However, changes in the distribution of monthly mean temperatures, do show large indirect influences of circulation changes. Especially in late summer, two models simulate very strong warming of warm months, which can be attributed to severe summer drying in the simulations by these models. The models differ also significantly in the simulated warming of cold winter months. Finally, the models simulate rather different changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature, which is likely to impact on changes in temperature and precipitation. These results imply that several important aspects of climate change in Central Europe are highly uncertain.\n",

To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.",

We first use the results from the ``Climate of the 20th\nCentury Experiment'' to assess the ability of these models to\nreproduce the observed sea ice cover changes over the periods\n1981-2000 and 1951-2000. The projected sea ice changes over the 21st\ncentury in response to the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios\nA1B are then examined. Overall, there is a large uncertainty in\nsimulating the present-day sea ice coverage and thickness and in\npredicting sea ice changes in both hemispheres. Over the period\n1981-2000, we find that the multimodel average sea ice extent agrees\nreasonably well with observations in both hemipsheres despite the wide\ndifferces between the models. The largest uncertainties appear in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The climate change projections over the 21st\ncentury reveal that the annual mean sea ice extent decreases at\nsimilar rates in both hemispheres, and that the reduction in annual\nmean sea ice volume is about twice that of sea ice extent reduction in\nthe Northern Hemisphere, in agreement with earlier studies. We show\nthat the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea ice extent increases\nin both hemispheres in a warming climate, with a larger magnitude in\nthe Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, it appears that the seasonal\ncycle of ice extent is more affected than the one of ice volume.

Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow. These models project 10\u201340% increases in runoff in eastern equatorial Africa, the La Plata basin and high-latitude North America and Eurasia, and 10\u201330% decreases in runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and mid-latitude western North America by the year 2050.

Seasonal extrema of low-latitude, hemispheric storage generally occur too early in the models, and model-specific errors in amplitude of the low-latitude annual variations are substantial.

Results are presented for a set of scenarios which were produced using a wide range of increasing levels of greenhouse gases. For the enhanced greenhouse warming experiments, the models simulated a reduction in the total number of events and an increase in the number of intense events. This is a robust result, which essentially all the models exhibit. Comparison of the results for each of the scenarios shows that the magnitude of the changes in the number of simulated events increases with increasing levels greenhouse gas forcing used in the scenarios. Even though the numbers of events change, there is no apparent change seen in the geographical distribution of the events; i.e., there is no obvious change in the positions of the storm tracks seen on hemispheric charts. This was also evident in the results for the filtered variance of the meridional wind which was used as a proxy for cyclone activity. In spite of this, it is possible that small shifts in the storm tracks, which are difficult to resolve with the relatively coarse grid used for analysis, could occur.",

Major discrepancies on the spatial distribution of these precipitation changes remain in the latest generation models analyzed here.  Despite this, we find a number of measures, both\nglobal and local, on which reasonable agreement is obtained, notably for the  regions of drying trend (negative precipitation anomalies).  Models agree on the overall amplitude of the precipitation decreases that occur at the margins of the convective zones, with percent error bars of magnitude similar to those for\nthe tropical warming.  Similar agreement is found on a precipitation climate\nsensitivity defined here, and on differential moisture increase inside and outside convection zones, a step in a hypothesized causal path leading to precipitation changes.  A measure of local inter-model agreement on significant trends indicates consistent predictions for particular regions.  Observed rainfall trends in several data sets show a significant summer drying trend in a main region of inter-model agreement: the Caribbean/Central-American region.\n",

            "abstract": "Tropical meridional ocean heat transport is studied in six coupled ocean-atmosphere models in which atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increased. In the Indo-Pacific, the strength of Subtropical Cells (STCs) changes in response to changes in the trade winds. However, the change is not consistent among models. In contrast, in all models the tropical Indo-Pacific heat transport remains nearly constant over time due to compensation of STC and the horizontal gyre variations. Even under strong atmospheric radiative forcing the tropical Indo-Pacific ocean heat transport trends are determined by changes in circulation, rather than changes in the stratification. Ocean heat transport in the tropical Atlantic responds to weakening of the basin-wide meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The trends in the South Atlantic STC do not affect ocean heat transport",

            "abstract": "The ability of five, global coupled climate models to simulate important atmospheric circulation characteristics in the Southern Hemisphere for the period 1960\u20131999 is assessed. The circulation features examined are the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), the semi-annual oscillation (SAO) and the quasi-stationary zonal wave 3 (ZW3). The models assessed are the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version 3 (CCSM3), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark 3, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Model, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model ER (GISS-ER) and the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Center Coupled Model Version 3. The simulations were compared to the NCAR\u2013NCEP reanalyses. The models simulate a SAO which differs spatially from the observed over the Pacific and Indian oceans. The amplitudes are too high over the southern ocean and too low over the midlatitudes. These differences are attributed to a circumpolar trough which is too deep and extends too far north, and to the inability of the models to simulate the middle to high latitude temperature gradient. The SAM is well-represented spatially by most models but there are important differences which may influence the flow over the Pacific and in the region extending from the Ross to Weddell Seas. The observed trend towards positive polarity in the SAM is apparent in the ensemble averages of the GISS-ER and CCSM3 simulations, suggesting that the trend is due to external forcing by changes in the concentration of ozone and greenhouse gases. ZW3 is well-represented by the models but the observed trend towards positive phases of ZW3 is not apparent in the simulations suggesting that the observed trend may be due to natural variability, not external forcing.",

            "abstract": "We examine the representation of the mean state and interannual variability of Antarctic sea ice in six simulations of the twentieth century from coupled models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report. The simulations exhibit a largely seasonal southern hemisphere ice cover, as observed. There is a considerable scatter in the monthly simulated climatological ice extent among different models, but no consistent bias when compared to observations. The scatter in maximum winter ice extent among different models is correlated to the strength of the climatological zonal winds suggesting that wind forced ice transport is responsible for much of this scatter. Observations show that the leading mode of southern hemisphere ice variability exhibits a dipole structure with anomalies of one sign in the Atlantic sector associated with anomalies of the opposite sign in the Pacific sector. The observed ice anomalies also exhibit eastward propagation with the Antarctic circumpolar current, as part of the documented Antarctic circumpolar wave phenomenon. Many of the models do simulate dipole-like behavior in sea ice anomalies as the leading mode of ice variability, but there is a large discrepancy in the eastward propagation of these anomalies among the different models. Consistent with observations, the simulated Antarctic dipole-like variations in the ice cover are led by sea-level pressure anomalies in the Amundsen/ Bellingshausen Sea. These are associated, to different degrees in different models, with both the southern annular mode and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are indications that the magnitude of the influence of ENSO on the southern hemisphere ice cover is related to the strength of ENSO events simulated by the different models.",

It has been postulated that these trends are associated with the enhanced levels of atmospheric CO2. In this context, it is natural to ask how continuing rising levels of CO2 may affect the climate in the future. The past IPCC reports have documented numerous studies where increased greenhouse gas concentrations have been prescribed in global climate model simulations. Now, new simulations with state-of-the-art climate models are becoming available for the next IPCC report (the Fourth Assessment Report, AR4), and results from a  number of these simulations are examined in order to determine whether they indicate a change in extreme precipitation on a monthly basis. The analysis involves a simple record-statistics framework, and shows that the upper tails of the probability distribution functions for monthly precipitation are being stretched in the mid- and high latitudes where there already have been reported mean level precipitation increases in the past. In other words, values corresponding to extreme monthly precipitation in the past are according to these result are becoming more frequent.",

            "title": "Methodology of Regional Climate Impact Studies for West Texas and its Importance",
            "abstract": "The study of impact of climate change on water resources is an important topic of the 21st century.  Rapid changes observed in the global climate over the past 100 years compared to those estimates of climate change over the past 1000 years motivated researchers worldwide to study the forcing factors causing such changes in the climate.  General circulation models (GCMs) are used to analyze the climate change on a global scale.  However, it is an established fact that GCMs are not very efficient in representing regional climate.  Impact studies, such as studying the effect of climate change on agricultural practices; water resources, etc, are carried out on a regional scale because the impact is specific to a given region.  In current project reported herein, the regional climate impact study is carried out for the Brazos River Basin in West Texas.\n\nOwing to the low precipitation rates and high potential evapotranspiration rates of the West Texas region, it is important to understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle of the region.  The main aim of the research reported herein is to analyze those changes and provide results to the policy makers so they could set up policies for the future in accordance to the changes projected by the models.  \n\nThe first step of the project was to choose a GCM that represents the climate forcings of the West Texas region. GCM grid outputs were used as input boundary conditions for a regional climate model.  The selection of the GCM was based on a careful comparison of the output from 15 GCMs.  The comparison was based on two parameters, climate uncertainty and socio-economic uncertainty.  The climate uncertainty was addressed by comparing the climate change as projected by several models.  The socio-economic uncertainty was addressed by comparing the climate projections by models for different IPCC SRES3 scenarios.  Scenarios A2 and B1 were chosen for this project because they represent the worst and best climate change scenarios, respectively.  In order to select the appropriate GCM for the study area, the output from each model has to be studied to observe how they represent the climate forcings affecting the climate change in the study \narea. \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present results from comparison of 15 GCM models for use in north-central Texas.  The results will be applied to an ongoing study of the Upper Brazos River Basin water resources to determine the potential impact of climate change on the water resources of that basin.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n1 Ph.D. Candidate, Civil Engineering Department, Texas Tech University, P.O.

            "abstract": "Global climate models (GCMs) have proven to be a valuable tool for investigating the impact of man-made green house gases on Earth\u2019s climate.  The immediate impact of global warming is increased temperatures.  In early 1990s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated a rise in global mean temperatures of 1.5oC to 4.5oC.  The indirect impacts of the climate change include: normal summers but warmer winters; normal daily high temperatures, but warmer nighttime lows; increases in extreme precipitation events (Karl, 1997); and changes in the hydrologic cycle including increased cloudiness.  The rapid progress in computer technologies has allowed for horizontal resolution of the order of several hundred kilometers and advanced treatment of physics in GCMs.  Although global effects are important, the more immediate impacts on humans will be on the regional and local scales.  Therefore it is not practical to predict demands for water, electricity, or agricultural aid based on a global perspective.  The description of the Hydrologic Cycle improves with increasing resolution due to the better topographical representation.  Therefore it is imperative to study regional scale climatic changes.  In this project, the study is concentrated on the Upper Brazos River region in the South Western United States.\n\nIn response to increased fresh water use by humans, water resources planners have developed new approaches for optimizing use of existing water supplies.  For the semi-arid High Plains and Low Rolling Plains areas of Texas, optimal use of water supplies is critical.  The water resources of this region are limited by the combination of low rainfall rates of 20 inches or less per year and potential evapotranspiration rates of up to 100 inches per year.  Water resources planners have a challenging task in allocating scarce water resources.  However, current planning methods rely on historic meteorologic data to determine expected water yields.  The possibility that climate change could dramatically alter current hydrologic systems and invalidate projections of firm yield should be examined.  \n\nThe main objective of the project is to develop a method of transferring climate change as predicted by a Regional Climate Model to assess the Brazos River Basin water resources system.  The study involves developing a Regional Climate Model for 1XCO2 and 2XCO2 scenarios using the Modular Modeling System (MMS) developed by USGS.    The results obtained by a GCM are used as the boundary conditions for the Regional Climate Model.  The CSIRO Mark 2 GCM model was used to generate a GCM for the study area.  The other objective of the project is to compare the dynamic regional model generated by the MMS with the downscaled statistical model already generated for this region by Troy Dorman (2003).  The climate change data obtained by the Regional Climate Model will be used to assess the likely impact of changes on the Hydrologic Cycle in the Brazos River Basin.  The changes in the Evapotranspiration levels and the recharge due to the Climate Change will also be analyzed.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nRegional climate modeling, GCMs, Brazos river basin water resources, weather prediction, climate modeling, MMS.  \n",

            "abstract": "A hydrologic model was driven by the climate projected by 11 GCMs under two emissions scenarios (the higher emission SRESA2 and the lower emission SRESB1) to investigate whether the projected hydrologic changes by 2071-2100 have a high statistical confidence, and to determine the confidence level that the A2 and B1 emissions scenarios produce differing impacts. There are highly significant average temperature increases by 2071-2100 of 3.7\u00b0C under A2 and 2.4\u00b0C under B1; July increases are 5\u00b0C for A2 and 3\u00b0C for B1. Two high confidence hydrologic impacts are increasing Winter streamflow and decreasing late Spring and Summer flow. Less snow at the end of Winter is a confident projection, as is earlier arrival of the annual flow volume, which has important implications on California water management. The two emissions pathways show some differing impacts with high confidence: the degree of warming expected; the amount of decline in summer low flows; the shift to earlier streamflow timing; and the decline in end-of-winter snow pack, with more extreme impacts under higher emissions in all cases. This indicates that future emissions scenarios play a significant role in the degree of impacts to water resources in California.\n\nManuscript (accepted 12 July 2006) available on-line: <a href=\"http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/papers/maurer_ipcc_manuscript.pdf\">http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/papers/maurer_ipcc_manuscript.pdf</a>",

            "abstract": "We analyze the impact of Arctic sea ice concentrations, surface albedo, cloud fraction, and cloud ice and liquid water paths on the surface and top-of-atmosphere short-wave radiation budget in the 20th century simulations of three coupled models participating in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report. The models are:  Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE Version R (GISS-ER), the UK Met Office Hadley Centre Model (UKMO HadCM3), and the National Center for Atmosphere Research Climate Community System Model (NCAR CCSM3). The models agree with each other and with observations of high Arctic mean cloud fraction in summer, however, large differences are found in the cloud ice and liquid water contents. Of the three models analyzed, the simulated Arctic clouds of the CCSM3 model have the highest liquid water content, exceeding the observed values. The clouds in the GISS-ER model are characterized by extremely high ice content and little liquid water content, and the HadCM3 model clouds hold moderate amounts of ice and relatively small amounts of liquid water. In the CCSM3 model, the high surface albedo and strong cloud short-wave radiative forcing both significantly decrease the amount of short-wave radiation absorbed by the Arctic Ocean surface during the summer. In the GISS-ER and HadCM3 models, the surface and cloud effects compensate: the first model with higher summer surface albedo has a larger downwelling short-wave flux, compared to the latter model with the lower surface albedo. Due to the differences in the models' cloud and surface properties, the Arctic Ocean surface gains about 20\\% and 40\\% more energy during the melt period in the GISS-ER and HadCM3 models, respectively, compared to the CCSM3 model. The HadCM3 model shows the largest reduction in both the sea ice area and volume during the summer consistent with the largest surface net short-wave radiation. In GISS-ER large winter sea ice thickness impairs the sea ice area reduction during the melt period counteracting the excessive net short-wave flux, while CCSM3 shows a significant decrease in both the sea ice area and volume during the summer despite the net short-wave flux deficiency. Substantial decrease in the sea ice area predicted by the end of the 21st Century in the CCSM3 model is associated with the large drop in the surface albedo, which is only partly compensated by the increased cloud short-wave forcing. In the HadCM3 and GISS-ER models, however, the compensation of the surface albedo and cloud short-wave forcing effects is one of the factors explaining moderate future sea ice volume trends. \n",

            "abstract": "Climate projections are the cornerstone for assessing the potential impacts of change at the regional scale. Such regional assessments are sometimes questioned, however, by the perceived failure of global climate models to reproduce key processes responsible for regional trends. Here, we systematically compare observed climate over the U.S. Northeast (NE) with historical and future simulations from eight global models and two downscaling approaches to answer two key questions. First, to what degree are the global models able to simulate regional circulation patterns and their relationship to surface climate in the NE? How much confidence should we then place in future projections of climate change at the regional level? Some uncertainty remains to be resolved, particularly related to the influence of large-scale teleconnection patterns on surface climate characteristics over a topographically diverse region such as the NE. However, the primary changes projected to occur in climate over the next century \u2013 namely, slightly greater temperature increases in summer as compared with winter, and increases in winter precipitation \u2013 are consistent with projected trends in regional climate processes and are relatively independent of model or scale. Furthermore, downscaling produces accurate representations of temporal and spatial distributions of climate across the region. Together, these suggest confidence in the direction and potential range of the most notable regional climate trends, with the absolute magnitude of change depending on both the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing as well as the emissions pathway we follow over the next century.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the potential impacts of global climate change on a specific region requires integrating projected changes with the unique regional characteristics that will affect and modify those changes at the regional scale. Focusing on key climate indicators in the U.S. Northeast, we assess the extent to which multiple simulations of 20th century climate from 9 AR4 AOGCMs are able to reproduce observed changes in these indicators, and evaluate projected future trends in primary climate characteristics and indicators of change. The analysis encompasses a range of climate indicators that characterize the region, including heavy rainfall and drought, the depth and extent of snow cover, soil moisture, and streamflow in unmanaged rivers, and changes in biometeorological indicators that depend on accumulated temperature and precipitation, such as growing season, frost days, and Spring Indices. Projected changes in almost all of the temperature-related climate indicators all show signals consistent with warming temperatures across both observations and a broad range of past and future model simulations. In the future, model simulations indicate significantly larger increases under the SRES mid-high (A2) and higher (A1FI) as compared to the lower (B1) emissions scenario. These findings highlight the on-going influence of climate change on a wide range of regional indicators, providing confidence regarding the direction, and guidance regarding the magnitude, of many regional climate trends, many of which appear to depend fundamentally upon the emission pathways followed over the next century.",

Yet, given the present calibrations, a bias is found between different estimates of $\\alpha$, \nwith modelled global albedos being systematically higher than the observed. The difference between models and observations is larger for the more recent CERES measurements than the older ERBE measurements.\nThrough the study of seasonal anomalies and space- and time distribution of correaltions between models and observations, specific regions with large discrepancies can be identified. It is hereby found that models appear to overestimate the albedo during boreal summer and underestimate it during austral summer.\nFurthermore, the seasonal variations of albedo in subtropical areas dominated by low stratiform clouds, as well as in dry desert regions in the subtropics, seem to be poorly simulated by the models.",

We have developed a method for calculating mass-balance changes by combining ice-sheet average timeseries from AOGCM projections for future centuries both with information from high-resolution climate models run for short periods and with a 20-km ice-sheet mass-balance model. Antarctica contributes negatively to sea level on account of increased accumulation, while Greenland contributes positively because ablation increases more rapidly. The uncertainty in the results is about 20% for Antarctica and 35% for Greenland. Changes in ice-sheet topography and dynamics are not included, but we discuss their possible effects. For an annual and area-average warming exceeding 4.5+-0.9 K in Greenland, and 3.1+-0.8 K in the global average, the net surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet becomes negative, in which case it is likely that the ice sheet would eventually be eliminated, raising global-average sea level by 7 m.\n",

The approach is based on downscaling of the Weibull parameters of the wind speed probability distribution from AOGCM derived 500 hPa and relative vorticity sea-level pressure gradients, and is demonstrated to generate accurate depictions of the wind climate during the transfer function conditioning period. Bootstrapping is used to develop 100 realizations for each downscaling period which are used to assess the uncertainty in the results due to stochastic effects in the AOGCM derived downscaling predictors. Projected changes in the wind speed probability distribution vary with the AOGCMs from which the predictors are derived, but generally it is shown that in the 2081-2100 climate projection period, mean wind speeds, 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density are slightly lower than during 1961-1990 at the majority of the 46 stations studied. Conversely it is found that there is no significant difference between conditions during 2046-2065 and 1961-1990 based on the ensemble of downscaling results. Equally, the winter time of 2046-2065 is largely indistinguishable from 1961-1990 for the majority of stations, while the winters of 2081-2100 appear to be associated with lower mean and 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density.",

Eight years of daily precipitation from each model\u2019s 20th century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite retrieved precipitation. Space-time spectral analysis is used to obtain the variance and phase speed of dominant convectively coupled equatorial waves, including the MJO, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby (ER), mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG), and eastward inertio-gravity\n(EIG) and westward inertio-gravity (WIG) waves. The variance and propagation of the MJO, defined as the eastward wavenumbers 1-6, 30-70 day mode, are examined in detail.\n\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs still have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the tropical intraseasonal variability. The total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance of precipitation is too weak in most of the models. About half of the models have signals of convectively coupled equatorial waves, with Kelvin and MRG-EIG waves especially prominent. However, the variances are generally too weak for all wave modes except the EIG wave, and the phase speeds are generally too fast, being scaled to excessively deep equivalent depths. An interesting\nresult is that this scaling is consistent within a given model across modes, in that both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes scale similarly to a certain equivalent depth. Excessively deep equivalent depths suggest that these models may not have a large enough reduction in their \u201ceffective static stability\u201d by diabatic heating.\n\nThe MJO variance approaches the observed value in only two of the 14 models, but is less than half of the observed value in the other 12 models. The ratio between the eastward MJO variance and the variance of its westward counterpart is too small in most of the models, which is consistent with the lack of highly coherent eastward propagation of the MJO in many models. Moreover, the MJO variance in 13 of the 14 models does not come from a pronounced spectral peak, but usually comes from part of an overreddened spectrum, which in turn is associated with too strong persistence of equatorial precipitation. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the MJO are the only ones having convective closures/triggers linked in some way to moisture convergence.",

When most of the energy is within the seasonal cycle, little is left for inter-annual signals and vice versa. An Interannual Coupling Strength (ICS) is defined and its relation with the modelled El Ni\u00f1o frequency is compared to that predicted by theoretical models. An assessment of the modelled El Ni\u00f1o in term of SST mode (S-mode) or thermocline mode (T-mode) shows that most models are locked into a S-mode and that only a few models exhibit a hybrid mode, like in observations. It is concluded that several basic El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 mean state \u2013 seasonal cycle relationships proposed by either theory or analysis of observations seem to be reproduced by CGCMs. This is especially true for the amplitude of El Ni\u00f1o and is less clear for its frequency. Most of these relationships, first established for the pre-industrial control simulations, hold for the double and quadruple CO stabilized scenarios. The models that exhibit the largest El Ni\u00f1o amplitude change in these greenhouse gas increase scenarios are those that exhibit a mode change towards a T-mode (either from S-mode to hybrid or hybrid to T-mode). This follows the observed 1976 climate shift in the tropical Pacific, and supports the \u2013 still debated \u2013 finding of studies that associated this shift to increased greenhouse gases. In many respects, these models are also among those that best simulate the tropical Pacific climatology (ECHAM5/MPI-OM, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, MRI-CGM2.3.2, UKMO-HadCM3). Results from this large subset of models suggest the likelihood of increased El Ni\u00f1o amplitude in a warmer climate, though there is considerable spread of El Ni\u00f1o behavior among the models and the changes in the subsurface thermocline properties that may be important for El Ni\u00f1o change could not be assessed. There are no clear indications of an El Ni\u00f1o frequency change with increased greenhouse gases. ",

            "abstract": "Tropical Pacific interannual variability is examined in nine state-of-the-art coupled climate models, and compared with observations and ocean analyses data sets, the primary focus being on the spatial structure and spectral characteristics of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The spatial patterns of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from the coupled models are characterized by maximum variations displaced from the coast of South America, and generally extending too far west with respect to observations. Thermocline variability is characterized by dominant modes that are qualitatevely similar in all the models, and consistent with the \"recharge oscillator\" paradigm for ENSO. The meridional scale of the thermocline depth anomalies is generally narrower than observed, a result that can be related to the pattern of zonal wind stress perturbations in the central-western equatorial Pacific. The wind stress response to the eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies in the models is narrower and displaced further west than observed. The meridional scale of the wind stress can affect the amount of warm water involved in the recharge/discharge of the equatorial thermocline, while the longitudinal location of the wind stress anomalies can influence the advection of the mean zonal temperature gradient by the anomalous zonal currents, a process that may favor the growth and longer duration of ENSO events when the wind stress perturbations are displaced eastwards. Thus, both discrepancies of the wind stress anomaly patterns in the coupled models with respect to observations (narrow meridional extent, and westward displacement along the equator) may be responsible for the ENSO timescale being shorter in the models than in observations. The examination of the leading advective processes in the SST tendency equation indicates that vertical advection of temperature anomalies tends to favor ENSO growth in all the CGCMs, but at a smaller rate than in observations. In some models it can also promote a phase transition. Longer periods tend to be associated with thermocline and advective feedbacks that are in phase with the SST anomalies, while advective tendencies that lead the SST anomalies by a quarter cycle favor ENSO transitions, thus leading to a shorter period.

Most models successfully capture the IO&#8217;s delayed, basin-wide warming response\na few months after El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) peaks in the Pacific. ENSO&#8217;s oceanic teleconnection into the IO, by coastal waves through the Indonesian archipelago, is poorly simulated in these models, with significant shifts in the turning latitude of radiating Rossby waves. In observations, ENSO forces, by the atmospheric bridge mechanism, strong ocean Rossby waves\nthat induce anomalies of SST, atmospheric convection and tropical cyclones in a thermocline dome over the southwestern tropical IO. While the southwestern IO thermocline dome is simulated in nearly all the models, this ocean Rossby wave response to ENSO is present only in a few of the models examined, suggesting difficulties in simulating ENSO&#8217;s teleconnection in surface wind. A majority of models display an equatorial zonal mode of the Bjerknes feedback with spatial\nstructures and seasonality similar to the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) in observations. This success appears due to their skills in simulating the mean state of the equatorial IO. Corroborating the role of the Bjerknes feedback in IOD, the thermocline depth, SST, precipitation and zonal wind are mutually positively correlated in these models, as in observations. The IOD-ENSO correlation during boreal fall ranges from -0.43 to 0.74 in the different models, suggesting that ENSO is one, but not the only, trigger for IOD.\n",

Small-scale effects of increasing CO2 and natural\ninternal variability both play important roles here.  These small-scale\nfeatures make multi-model comparisons difficult for precipitation.  New\nmethods are presented, which allow information from small spatial scales\nto be usefully compared across an ensemble of multiple models.  Our\nanalysis philosophy works with statistical distributions of small-scale\nvariations within climatological regions.  A major result of this work\nis a set of emergent relationships coupling the small and regional-scale\neffects of CO2 on precipitation trends.  Within each region, a single\nrelationship fits the ensemble of 19 different climate models.  Using\nthese relationships, a surprisingly large part of the inter-model\nvariance in small-scale effects of CO2, is explainable simply by the\ninter-model variance in the regional mean (a form of pattern scaling). \nDifferent regions show distinctly different relationships.  These\nrelationships imply that regional mean results are still useful, as long\nas the inter-regional variation in their relationship with\nimpact-relevant extreme trends is recognized.

            "abstract": "Most of the uncertainty in the climate sensitivity of contemporary general circulation models (GCMs) is believed to be connected with differences in the simulated radiative feedback from clouds. Traditional methods of evaluating clouds in GCMs compare time\u2013mean geographical cloud fields or aspects of present-day cloud variability, with observational data. In both cases a hypothetical assumption is made that the quantity evaluated is relevant for the mean climate change response. Nine GCMs (atmosphere models coupled to mixed-layer ocean models) from the CFMIP and CMIP model comparison projects are used in this study to demonstrate a common relationship between the mean cloud response to climate change and present-day variability. Although atmosphere\u2013mixed-layer ocean models are used here, the results are found to be equally applicable to transient coupled model simulations. When changes in cloud radiative forcing (CRF) are composited by changes in vertical velocity and saturated lower tropospheric stability, a component of the local mean climate change response can be related to present-day variability in all of the GCMs. This suggests that the relationship is not model specific and might be relevant in the real world. In this case, evaluation within the proposed compositing framework is a direct evaluation of a component of the cloud response to climate change. None of the models studied are found to be clearly superior or deficient when evaluated, but a couple appear to perform well on several relevant metrics. Whilst some broad similarities can be identified between the 60N\u201360S mean change in CRF to increased CO2 and that predicted from present-day variability, the two cannot be quantitatively constrained based on changes in vertical velocity and stability alone. Hence other processes also contribute to the global mean cloud response to climate change.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the analysis of winter (ONDJFM) storm events and their changes due to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations over Europe. In order to assess the uncertainties due to model formulation, 4 regional climate models (RCM\u2019s) with 5 high resolution experiments, and 4 global models (GCM\u2019s) are considered.\nFirstly, cyclone systems as synoptic scale processes in winter are investigated, as they are mainly relevant for the occurrence of extreme, damage causing wind speeds. This is achieved by use of an objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm, applied to the GCM\u2019s. Secondly, changes in extreme near surface wind speeds are analysed. Based on percentile thresholds, the studied extreme wind speed indices allow a consistent analysis over Europe and take systematic deviations of the models into account. Relative changes in both intensity and frequency of extreme winds and their related uncertainties are assessed and related to changing patterns of extreme cyclones. Common feature of all investigated GCM\u2019s is a reduced track density over Central Europe under climate change conditions if all systems are considered. If only extreme (i.e. the 5% strongest) cyclones are taken into account, an increasing cyclone activity for western parts of Central Europe is analysed, although the climate change signal reveals reduced spatial coherency as compared to all systems, partly revealing contrary results. With respect to extreme wind speeds, significant positive changes in intensity and frequency are obtained over at least 20% and 3% of the European domain under study (15\u00b0W-43\u00b0E; 35\u00b0-72\u00b0N), respectively. Location and extension of the affected areas (up to 60% and 50% of the domain for intensity and frequency, respectively), as well as the levels of changes (up to +15% and +200% for intensity and frequency, respectively) are shown to highly depend on the driving GCM, whereas differences between RCM\u2019s when driven by the same GCM are relatively small.

            "abstract": "Understanding the atmospheric low-frequency variability is of crucial importance in fields such as climate studies, climate change detection, and extended-range weather forecast. The Northern Hemisphere climate features the planetary waves as a relevant ingredient of the atmospheric variability. Several observations and theoretical arguments seem to support the idea that winter planetary waves indicator obey a non-gaussian statistics and may present a multimodal probability density function, thus characterizing the low-frequency portion of the climate system. We show that the upper tropospheric jet strength is a critical parameter in determining whether the planetary waves indicator exhibits a uni- or bimodal behavior, and we determine the relevant threshold value of the jet. These results are obtained by considering the data of the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for the overlapping period. Our results agree with the non-linear orographic theory, which explains the statistical non-normality of the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere and its possible bimodality.",

We adopt the classical approach of computing the Hayashi spectra of the 500 hPa geopotential height fields and we introduce an ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral subdomains. Discrepancies are found especially in the pre-satellite years of the records in the high frequency-high wavenumber propagating waves. This implies that in the pre-satellite period the two datasets have a different representation of the baroclinic available energy conversion processes. Minor differences are also found in the description of low frequency\u2013low wavenumber standing waves. We observe a positive impact of the satellite data on the representation of wave activity over the oceanic sectors in the period starting from 1979, in particular on the description of high frequency variability. Since in the pre-satellite period the assimilated data are more scarce, predominately over the oceans, and of lower quality than found later on, they provide a weaker constraint to the model dynamics. Therefore, the resulting discrepancies in the reanalysis products may be mainly attributed to differences in the models\u2019 behaviour.",

            "abstract": "In this study we document how model biases in extratropical surface wind and precipitation, due to ocean- atmosphere coupling, are communicated to the equatorial Pacific thermocline through Pacific Subtropical Cell (STC) pathways. We compare the simulation of climate mean Pacific Subtropical Cells (STCs) in the NCAR Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) to observations and to an uncoupled ocean simulation (the ocean component of the CCSM3 forced by observed wind stress and surface fluxes). We use two versions of the CCSM3 with atmospheric resolution of 2.8 degrees (T42) and 1.4 degrees (T85) to investigate whether the climate mean STCs are sensitive to the resolution of the atmospheric model. \n\nSince STCs provide water that maintains the equatorial thermocline, we first document biases in equatorial temperature and salinity fields. We then investigate to what extent these biases are due to the simulation of extratropical-tropical water mass exchanges in the coupled models. We demonstrate that the coupled models' cold and fresh bias in the equatorial thermocline is due to the subduction of significantly fresher and colder water in the South Pacific. This freshening is due to too much precipitation in the South Pacific Convergence Zone. Lagrangian trajectories of water that flows to the equatorial thermocline are calculated to demonstrate that the anomalously large potential vorticity barriers in the coupled simulations in both the North and South Pacific prevent water in the lower thermocline from reaching the equator. The equatorial thermocline is shown to be primarily maintained by water that subducts in the subtropical South Pacific in both the coupled and uncoupled simulations. It is shown that the zonally integrated transport convergence at the equator in the subsurface branch of the climate mean STCs is well simulated in the uncoupled ocean model. However, coupling reduces the net equatorward pycnocline transport by ~4 Sv at 9S and ~1 Sv at 9N. An increase in the atmospheric resolution from T42 to T85 results in more realistic equatorial trades and off-equatorial convergence zones.",

            "abstract": "Observational studies of the Pacific basin since the 1950's have demonstrated that a decrease (increase) in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is significantly correlated with a spin-up (slow-down) of the Pacific Subtropical Cells (STCs). STCs are shallow wind-driven overturning circulations that provide a pathway by which extratropical atmospheric variability can impact the equatorial Pacific thermocline and, through upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, tropical Pacific SSTs. Recent studies have shown that this observed relationship between SSTs and STCs is absent in coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th centuries. In this paper we investigate what causes this relationship to breakdown and to what extent this limits the models' ability to simulate observed climate change in the equatorial Pacific since the late 19th century. To provide insight into these questions we first show that the NCAR Community Climate System Model's simulation of observed climate change since the 1970's has a robust signal in the equatorial Pacific that bears a close resemblance to observations. Strikingly absent is a robust signal in the equatorial thermocline due to the underestimate of STC variability. Our results suggest that the coupled model may be reproducing the observed local ocean response to changes in forcing but inadequately reproducing the remote STC-forcing of the tropical Pacific due to the underestimate of extratropical winds that force these ocean circulations. These conclusions are found to be valid in 5 different coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th centuries (CCSM3, GISS EH, GFDL-CM2.1, CSIRO-Mk3, and HadCM3).",

The error in precipitation simulation corresponds to that in circulation simulation.\n  Moreover, we also evaluate the simulation performance of precipitation in interannual variability and during the period of the monsoon onset and retreat. It is found that the models have better simulation performances in winter West Pacific Ocean than that in summer. The simulations are not very well in Eastern Asia Subtropical and Indian Ocean.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we use a dry radiative-transportive climate model to illustrate that the atmospheric poleward heat transport plays an important role in amplifying the polar surface warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  Because of a much warmer surface in tropics, the anthropogenic radiative forcing is larger in tropics than in extratropics for same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.   A direct response to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an increase in the atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature contrast, leading to a strengthening of the atmospheric poleward heat transport.   As a result, part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the low-latitude atmosphere due to an increase in its opacity is transported to high latitudes.  This implies a \u201cgreenhouse-plus\u201d (\u201cgreenhouse-minus\u201d) feedback to the high (low) latitude surface temperatures, which acts to amplify (reduce) the initial surface warming in high (low) latitudes, causing a larger warming in high latitudes.  The Stefan-Boltzmann feedback suppresses the negative dynamical feedback in low latitudes more strongly than the positive in high latitudes, amplifying the global mean surface temperature warming.   \nBecause of the oceanic poleward heat transport, the ocean surface temperature in extratropics is warmer in winter compared to the land, implying a larger radiative forcing for the same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  The same dynamical feedback mechanism would also amplify the land surface warming in extratropics by transporting part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the atmosphere over the ocean surface to land.   This explains partly why the observed land surface warming in extratropics is stronger than the surrounding oceans in winter. \n",

            "abstract": "The largest warming over the last several decades has been observed in high latitudes. Cai (2005) proposed that part of the large amplitude climate warming in high latitudes could be explained by the \u201cdynamical amplifier\u201d feedback. This study will first provide observational and modeling evidences to validate the dynamical amplifier theory. The second part will address the question whether part of the differences in the CGCM\u2019s global warming projections can be explained by the dynamical amplifier theory. The theory predicts an upward trend of the net radiation surplus (deficit) in low (high) latitudes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gazes. \n\tThe radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) using the ERA40 reanalysis and climate model simulations forced by anthropogenic radiative forcings made at 14 climate centers were analyzed.  The results indicate that both the radiation energy surplus in low latitudes and deficit in high latitudes at the TOA have been strengthened over the last several decades. Such an intensification of the radiation energy imbalance at the TOA is also confirmed by most of the climate model simulations.  Furthermore, the analysis of the net radiation budget between the surface and the TOA confirms that the change in the TOA energy imbalance is indeed due to the upward trend in the poleward heat transport, in accordance with the dynamical amplifier theory. \n\tThere is a large model-to-model variability of the intensification of the poleward heat transport among the 14 climate model simulations. It is found that about 59% of the global warming projection uncertainties, which varies from 1.5K to 4K, forced by the 2CO2 forcing can be explained by the variation of the intensification of the poleward heat transport among models.  The inter-model variability of the change in the poleward heat transport explains about 66% of the warming projection uncertainties for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and 54% for the Southern Hemisphere (SH).  The differences in the poleward heat transport intensification also explain about 71% and 49% of the warming uncertainties in the NH and SH high latitudes.  Therefore, it can be concluded that a large part of the uncertainties in the CGCM\u2019s global warming projections can be explained by the dynamical amplifier theory.\n",

The technique is applied to the downscaling of daily precipitation over South Africa. SOMs are used to characterize the state of the atmosphere on a localized domain surrounding each target location, based on NCEP 6-hourly reanalysis data from 1979-2002, and using surface and 700 hPa u and v wind vectors and specific and relative humidities, and surface temperature. Each unique atmospheric state is associated with an observed precipitation probability distribution function (PDF). Future climate states are derived from three GCMs: HadAM3, ECHAM4.5, CSIRO Mk2. In each case, the GCM data are mapped to the NCEP SOMs for each target location and a precipitation value is drawn at random from the associated precipitation PDF. The downscaling approach combines the advantages of a direct transfer function and a stochastic weather generator, and provides an indication of the strength of the regional versus stochastic forcing, as well as a measure of stationarity in the atmosphere-precipitation relationship.\n\nThe methodology is applied to South Africa. The downscaling reveals a similarity in the projected climate change between the models. Each GCM is projecting similar changes in atmospheric state and they converge on a downscaled solution that points to increased summer rainfall in the interior and eastern part of the country, and a decrease in winter rainfall in the Western Cape. The actual GCM precipitation projections from the three models show large areas of inter-model disagreement, suggesting that the model differences may be due to their precipitation parameterization schemes, rather than to basic disagreements in their projections of the changing atmospheric state over South Africa.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines variations of the surface air temperature (SAT) over China and the globe in the twentieth-century simulated by nineteen coupled climate models driven by historical natural and anthropogenic forcings. Most models perform well in simulating both the global and the Northern Hemispheric mean SAT evolutions of the twentieth-century. The inclusion of natural forcings improves the simulation, in particular for the first half of the century. The reproducibility of the SAT averaged over China is lower than that of the global and hemispheric averages, but it is still acceptable. The contribution of natural forcings to the SAT over China in the first half of the century is not as robust as that to the global and hemispheric averages. No model could successfully produce the reconstructed warming over China in the 1920s. The prescribed natural and anthropogenic forcings in the coupled climate models mainly produce the warming trends and the decadal to interdecadal scale SAT variations with poor performances at shorter timescales. The prominent warming trend in the last half of the century over China and its acceleration in recent decades are weakly simulated. There are discrepancies between the simulated and observed regional features of the SAT trend over China. Few models could produce the summertime cooling over the middle part of eastern China (27\u00ba-36\u00baN), while two models acceptably produce the meridional gradients of the wintertime warming trends, with North China experiencing larger warming. Limitations of the current state-of-the-art coupled climate models in simulating spatial patterns of the twentieth-century SAT over China cast a shadow upon their capability toward projecting credible geographical distributions of future climate change through IPCC scenario simulations.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Understanding the response of the global hydrological cycle to recent and future anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols is a major challenge for the climate modelling community. Recent climate scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are here analysed to explore the geographical origin of, and the possible reasons for, uncertainties in the hydrological model response to global warming. Using the 20th century simulations and the SRES-A2 scenarios from eight different coupled ocean-atmosphere models, it is shown that the main uncertainties originate from the tropics, where even the sign of the zonal mean precipitation change remains uncertain over land. Given the large interannual fluctuations of tropical precipitation, it is then suggested that the ENSO variability can be used as a surrogate of climate change to better constrain the model reponse. While the simulated sensitivity of global land precipitation to global mean surface temperature indeed shows a remarkable similarity between the interannual and climate change timescales respectively, the model ability to capture the ENSO-precipitation relationship is not a major constraint on the global hydrological projections. Only the model that exhibits the highest precipitation sensitivity clearly appears as an outlier. Besides deficiencies in the simulation of the ENSO-tropical rainfall teleconnections, the study indicates that uncertainties in the 21st century evolution of these teleconnections represent an important contribution to the model spread, thus emphasizing the need for improving the simulation of the tropical Pacific variability to provide more reliable scenarios of the global hydrological cycle. It also suggests that validating the mean present-day climate is not sufficient to assess the reliability of climate projections, and that interannual variability is another suitable and possibly more useful candidate for constraining the model response. Finally, it is shown that uncertainties in precipitation change are, like precipitation itself, very unevenly distributed over the globe, the most vulnerable countries sometimes being those where the anticipated precipitation changes are the most uncertain.\n",

The analysis is focused on the Iberian peninsula for December-January-February (DJF). The study was performed with observed data from National Meteorological Institutes, reanalysis data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research, teleconnection indices and model simulations. First, we evaluated the seasonal cycle, mean winter pattern and tendency for nine model simulations. Then, we selected four models to obtain interannual variability and to diagnose the links between precipitation and large-scale circulation. This inter-comparison is based on the modes obtained by the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and spectral analyses to investigate the temporal properties of the most significant spatial patterns. The models reproduce well the observed seasonal cycle and the mean winter pattern; however, they poorly capture the interannual variability found in observed data. To ascertain the reasons for these results, features affecting the precipitation process are considered by analyzing the relationships with the dominant modes of large-scale atmospheric fields, such as sea level pressure, storm activity, jet stream, moisture flux, and teleconnection indices. The precipitation response to the mean flow suggests signs of potential seasonal predictability in DJF.",

Our analysis includes one simulation of seven Atmosphere-Ocean Global Circulation Models (AOGCMs), which participated in the IPCC Project and provided at least one simulation for the 20th century (20c3m) and one simulation for each of three SRES scenarios A2, A1B and B1. We developed a statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics to evaluate the models\u2019 skills in simulating late 20th century temperature over continental areas. Some criteria (Model Weight Indices) are computed allowing comparing over such large regions how each model captures the temperature large scale structures and contributes to the multi-model combination. As the study demonstrates, the use of neural networks, optimized by Bayesian statistics, leads to two major results. First, the Model Weights Indices can be interpreted as optimal weights for a linear combination of the climate models. Second, the comparison between the neural network projection of 21st century conditions and a linear combination of such conditions allows the identification of the regions, which will most probably change, according to model biases and model ensemble variance. Model simulations in the southern tip of South America and along the Chilean and Peruvian coasts or in the northern coasts of South America (Venezuela, Guiana) are particularly poor. Overall, our results present an upper bound of potential temperature warming for each scenario. Spatially, in SRES A2, our major findings are that Tropical South America could warm up by about 4\u00b0C, while southern South America would also undergo  a near 2-3\u00b0C  average warming. Interestingly, this annual mean temperature trend is modulated by the seasonal cycle in a contrasted way according to the regions. In southern South America, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle tends to increase, while in northern South America, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle would be reduced leading to much milder winters. We show that all the scenarios have similar patterns and only differ in amplitude. SRES A1B differ from SRES A2 mainly for  the late 21st century, reaching more or less an 80%-90% amplitude compared  to SRES A2. SRES B1, however, diverges from the other scenarios as soon as 2025. For the late 21st century, SRES B1 displays amplitudes, which are about half those of SRES A2.",

We developed a statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics to compute a transfer function between models and observations.

To evaluate the results, various criteria were computed making it possible to evaluate the models\u2019 skills in simulating late 20th century precipitation over continental areas as well as their divergence in projecting climate change conditions. Despite the relatively poor skill of most of the climate models in simulating present-day large scale precipitation patterns, we identified two types of models: the climate models with moderate-to-normal (i.e. close to observations) precipitation amplitudes over the Amazonian basin; and the climate models with a low precipitation in that region and too high a precipitation on the equatorial Pacific coast. Under SRES A2 greenhouse gas forcing, the neural network simulates an increase in precipitation over the La Plata basin coherent the mean model ensemble projection. Over the Amazonian basin, a decrease in precipitation is projected. However, the models strongly diverge, and the neural network was found to give more weight to models, which better simulate present-day climate conditions. In the southern tip of the continent, the models poorly simulate present-day climate. However, they display a fairly good convergence when simulating climate change response with a weak increase south of 45\u00b0S and a decrease in Chile between 30\u00b0S and 45\u00b0S.

In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), observations show a statistically significant decrease of sea ice extent and an acceleration of sea ice retreat during the past three decades. However, from the modeled natural variability of sea ice extents in control simulations, we conclude that the acceleration is not statistically significant and should not be extrapolated into the future.  Most of the models, like the observations, show an absence of a prominent seasonal cycle in the trend values.  Both observations and model simulations show that climate variability in sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is much larger than in the NH and that the SH sea ice extent trends are not statistically significant.

This work is focused on trends of precipitation and clouds over tropical ocean and land.\nWe find that the CGCMs are reasonably consistent in depicting aspects of long term changes in the twentieth century climate and the tropical hydrological cycle, including 1) a relatively good simulation of trends in surface warming over both the tropical ocean and land, in agreement with observations; 2) increasing precipitation over the tropical ocean and decreasing precipitation over tropical land; 3) an increasing trend in heavy and light rain, but a decreasing trend in moderate rain, over the tropical ocean; and 4) a reduction in total cloud cover in the tropics. These successful simulations are encouraging and enhance our confidence in the future climate projections provided by these models. On the other hand, the current generation of CGCMs still has a number of deficiencies, particularly in modeling clouds and their interactions with radiation. Although most CGCMs are able to simulate the correct sign of trends in precipitation and clouds, they significantly underestimate the magnitudes of the observations. These underestimations likely cause gross errors in model simulations of the global water and energy balance. A better understanding of physical processes and an improvement in the CGCM representations of physical processes associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation are needed. ",

Even the model with the highest prediction skill of the Sahel drought could only predict the increasing trend of severe drought events but not the beginning and duration of the events.     From analyses of the statistical characteristics of the hit- and miss- models,  we conclude that a good simulation of the Sahel drought requires a) a strong coupling between Sahel rainfall and Indian Ocean SST, with warm (cold) SST identified with Sahel drought (flood),  b) a significant coupling  between Sahel rainfall and  the Atlantic Ocean SST, with a warm equatorial Atlantic and cold extratropical North Atlantic coexisting with Sahel drought, and vice versa, and c) a robust land-surface feedback with strong sensitivity of precipitation and land evaporation to soil moisture.   These three characteristics constitute a sufficient condition for a good simulation of Sahel drought in CGCMs.  ",

            "abstract": "Results from eight ocean-atmosphere general circulation models are used to evaluate the influence of the projected changes in the oceanic stratification on the first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation in the ocean,associated with atmospheric CO2 increase. For each of the models, an oceanic state corresponding to the A1B stabilization experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm) is compared to a state corresponding to the pre-industrial control experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of\n280 ppm). In all of the models, the first baroclinic Rossby radius increases with increasing oceanic stratification in the warmer climate. There is, however, a considerable range among the models in the magnitude of the increase. At the latitudes of intense eddy activity associated with instability of western boundary currents (around 35-40 deg), the increase reaches 4 km on average, or about 15% of the local baroclinic Rossby radius. Some of the models predict an increase of the baroclinic Rossby radius by \nmore than 20% at these latitudes under the applied forcing. It is therefore suggested that in a plausible future warmer climate, the characteristic length scale of mesoscale eddies, as well as boundary currents and fronts, may increase. In addition, since the speed of long baroclinic Rossby waves is proportional to the squared baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, the results suggest that the time scale for large-scale dynamical oceanic adjustment may decrease in the warmer climate, thereby increasing the frequency of long-term climate variability where the oceanic Rossby wave dynamics set the dominant period. Finally, the speed of equatorial Kelvin waves and Rossby waves, carrying signals along the Equator, including those related to ENSO, is projected to increase. ",

            "abstract": "We have synthesized the sea ice simulations by the IPCC AR4 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the 4th Assessment Report) models for the climate of the 20th century and for global warming scenarios. A large number of model simulations realistically captured the climatological annual mean, seasonal cycle and temporal trends of sea ice area over the Northern Hemisphere during 1979-99, although there is considerable scatter among the models. In particular, multi-model ensemble means show promising estimates very close to observations for the late 20th century. Model projections for the 21st century demonstrate the largest sea ice area decreases generally in the SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A1B and A2 scenarios compared with the B1 scenario, indicating large multi-model ensemble mean reductions of -3.54 1.66X105 km2/decade in A1B, -4.08 1.33X105km2/decade in A2, and -2.22 1.11X105km2/decade in B1. The corresponding percentage reductions are 31.1%, 33.4%, and 21.6% in the last 20 years of the 21st century, relative to 1979-99. Further, multiyear ice coverage decreases rapidly at rates of -3.86 2.07X105km2/decade in A1B, -4.94 1.91X105km2/decade in A2 and -2.67 1.7107X105km2/decade in B1, making major contributions to the total ice reductions. In contrast, seasonal (first-year) ice area increases by 1.10 2.46X105km2/decade, 1.99 1.47X105 km2/decade and 1.05 1.9247 X105 km2/decade in the same scenarios, leading to decreases of 59.7% and 65.0% of the multiyear ice area and increases of 14.1% and 27.8% of the seasonal ice area in the last 20 years of this century.  Statistical analysis shows that many of the models are consistent in the sea ice change projections among all scenarios. The results include an evaluation of the 99% confidence interval of the model-derived change of sea ice coverage, giving a quantification of uncertainties in estimating sea ice changes based on the participating models. Hence the seasonal cycle of sea ice area is amplified and an increased large portion of seasonally ice-covered Arctic Ocean is expected at the end of the 21st century. The very different changes of multiyear and seasonal ice may have significant implications for the polar energy and hydrological budgets and pathways.",

The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse-rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, we find the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor to be tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse-rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.",

These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics.  A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab-ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios.

The cloud feedbacks in any given model are generally not consistent: the sign of the net cloud radiative feedback may vary according to the experimental design. However, both sets of experiments indicate that the variation of the total climate feedback across the models depends primarily on the variation of the net cloud feedback. Changes in different cloud types show much greater consistency between the two experiments for any individual model and amongst the set of models analyzed here.

In particular, it applies a new methodology that permits the inclusion of many more general circulation models (GCMs) into the analysis, and it also includes more recent observations. This methodology involves fitting a series of energy balance models (EBMs) to the GCM output in order to estimate the temporal response patterns to the various forcings.\n\nDespite considerable spread in estimated EBM parameters, characteristics of model performance, such as the transient climate response, appear to be more constrained for each of the forcings. The resulting estimated response patterns are provided as input to the standard fingerprinting method used in previous studies. The estimated GCM responses to changes in greenhouse gases are detected in the observed record for all of the GCMs, and are generally found to be consistent with the observed changes; the same is generally true for the responses to changes in stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions. GCM responses to changes in tropospheric sulfate aerosols and solar irradiance also appear consistent with the observed record, although the uncertainty is larger. Greenhouse gas and solar irradiance changes are found to have contributed to a best guess of &#8764;0.8 and &#8764;0.3 K warming over the 1901\u20132005 period, respectively, while sulfate aerosols have contributed a &#8764;0.4 K cooling. This analysis provides an observationally constrained estimate of future warming, which is found to be fairly robust across GCMs. By 2100, a warming of between about 1.5 and 4.5 K can be expected according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B emissions scenario.\n\nThese results indicate an emerging constraint for global mean surface temperature responses to external forcings across GCMs, which is corroborated in the observed record. This implies that observationally constrained estimates of past warming and predictions of future warming are indeed becoming robust.",

            "abstract": "The detection and attribution of climate change in the observed record plays a central role in synthesizing our knowledge of the climate system.  Unfortunately, the traditional method for detecting and attributing changes due to multiple forcings requires large numbers of general circulation model (GCM) simulations incorporating different initial conditions and forcing scenarios and these have only been performed with a small number of GCMs.  This paper presents an extension to the fingerprinting technique which permits the inclusion of GCMs in the multi-signal analysis of surface temperature even when the required families of ensembles have not been generated.  This is achieved by fitting a series of energy balance models (EBMs) to the GCM output in order to estimate the temporal response patterns to the various forcings.\n\nThis methodology is applied to the very large Challenge ensemble of 62 simulations of historical climate conducted with the NCAR CCSM 1.4 GCM, as well as some simulations from other GCMs.  Considerable uncertainty exists in the estimates of the parameters in fitted EBMs.  Nevertheless, temporal response patterns from these EBMs are more reliable and the combined EBM time series closely mimics the GCM in the context of transient forcing.  In particular, detection and attribution results from this technique appear self-consistent and consistent with results from other methods provided that all major forcings are included in the analysis.\n\nUsing this technique on the Challenge ensemble, the estimated responses to changes in greenhouse gases, tropospheric sulphate aerosols, and stratospheric volcanic aerosols are all detected in the observed record, but only the response to the tropospheric sulphate aerosols is consistent with the observed record without a scaling of the amplitude.  The estimated GCM response to SOL forcing is inconsistent with the observations.  The result is that the temperature difference of the 1995-2004 decade relative to the 1940-1949 decade can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, with a partially offsetting cooling from sulphate emissions and little contribution from natural sources.\n \nThe results support the viability of the new methodology as an extension to current analysis tools for the detection and attribution of climate change which will allow the inclusion of many more GCMs.  Shortcomings remain, however, and so it should not be considered a replacement to traditional techniques.",

The effects of greenhouse gases, tropospheric sulphate aerosols, and volcanic aerosols are all detected in the observed record, while the effects of solar irradiance are unclear.

To this aim, this paper presents\nsimulations of the Antarctic climate for the end of the 20th and 21st\ncenturies.

The simulated present-day surface\nmass balance is evaluated. It is found that the simulation is good on\ncontinental scales. Errors on regional scales are moderate when observed\nsea surface conditions are used; more significant regional biases appear\nwhen sea surface conditions from a coupled model run are prescribed. The\nsimulated Antarctic surface mass balance increases by 20 mm water\nequivalent per year in the next century, corresponding to a sea level\ndecrease of 0.78 mm yr-1 by the end of the 21st century. This surface\nmass balance increase is largely due to precipitation changes, while\nchanges in snow melt and turbulent latent surface fluxes are weak. The\ntemperature increase leads to an increased moisture transport towards\nthe interior of the continent because of the higher moisture holding\ncapacity of warmer air, but changes in atmospheric dynamics, in\nparticular off the Antarctic coast, regionally modulate this signal.",

            "abstract": "Possible future climate changes in California are investigated from a varied set of climate change model simulations. These simulations, conducted by three state-of-the-art global climate models, provide trajectories from three greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. These scenarios and the resulting climate simulations are not \"predictions,\" but rather are a limited sample from among the many plausible pathways that may affect California's climate. Future GHG concentrations are uncertain because they depend on future social, political, and technological pathways, and thus the IPCC has produced four \"families\" of emission scenarios. To explore some of these uncertainties, emissions scenarios A2 (a medium-high emissions) and B1 (low emissions) were selected from the current IPCC Fourth climate assessment, wich provides several recent model simulations driven by A2 and B1 emissions. The global climate model simulations addressed here were from PCM1, the Parallel Climate Model from the Natinoal Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) group, and CM2.1 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Fluids Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). \n\nAs part of the scenarios assessment, a statistical technique using properties of historical weather data was employed to correct model biases and \"downscale\" the global-model simulation of future climates to a finer level of detail, onto a grid of approximately 7 miles (12 kilometers), which is more suitable for impact studies at the scales needed by California decision makers. \n\nIn current climate-change simulations, temperatures over California warm significantly during the twenty-first century, with the temperature increases from approximately +3 deg F (1.5 deg C) in the lower emissions scenario (B1) withing the less responsive model (PCM1) to +8 deg F (4.5 deg C) in the higher emissions scenario (A2) within the more responsive model (CM2.1). Three of the simulations (all except the low-emission scenario run of the low-response model) exhibit more warming in summer than in winter. \n\nIn all of the simulations, most precipitation continues to occur in winter, with virtually all derived from North Pacific winter storms. Relatively little change in overall precipitation is projected. Climate warming has a profound influence in diminishing snow accumulations, because there is more rain and less snow, and earlier snowmelt. These snow losses increase as the warming increases, so that they are most severe under climate changes projected by the more sensitive model with the higher GHG emissions. \n",

            "title": "Projecting Future Sea Level",
            "abstract": "California's coastal observations and global model projections indicate that California's open coast and estuaries will experience increasing sea levels over the next century. Sea level rise has affected much of the coast of California, including the Southern California coast, the Central California open coast, and the San Francisco Bay and upper estuary. These trends, quantified from a small set of California tide gages, have ranged from 10-20 centimeters (cm) {3.9-7.9 inces} per century, quite similar to that estimated for global mean sea level. So far, there is little evidence that the rate of rise has accelerated, and the rate of rise at California tide gages has actually flattened since 1980, but projections suggest substantial sea level rise may occur over the next century. \n\nClimate change simulations project a substantial rate of global sea level rise over the next century due to thermal expansion as the oceans warm and runoff from melting land-based snow and ice accelerates. Sea level rise projected from the models increases with the amount of warming. Relative to sea levels in 2000, by the 2070-2099 period, sea level rise projections range from 11-54 cm {4.3-21 in} for simulations following the lower (B1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenario, from 14-61 cm {5.5-24 in} for the middle-upper (A2) emission scenario, and from 17-72 cm {6.7-28 in} for the highest (A1fi) scenario. In addition to relatively steady secular trends, sea levels along the California coast undergo shorter period variability over or below predicted tide levels and changes associated with long-term trends. These variations are caused by weather events and by seasonal to decadal climate fluctuations over the Pacific Ocean that in turn affect the Pacific coast. Highest coastal sea levels have occurred when winter storms and Pacific climate disturbances, such as El Nino, have coincided with high astronomical tides. \n\nThis study considers a range of projected future global sea level rises in examining possible impacts at California coastal and estuarine stations. Two climate models and three scenarios considered in this scenarios study provide a set of possible future weather and short-period climate fluctuations, and a range of potential long-term sea level rise values. A range of mean sea level rise was considered in combination with weather and El Nino fluctuations extracted from two global climate models and two GHG emissions scenarios. The mean sea level rise values, determined from a survey of several climate models, range from approximately 10-80 cm {3.9-31 in} between 2000 and 2100. The middle to higher end of this range would substantially exceed the historical rate of sea level rise of 15-20 cm {5.9-7.9 in} per century observed at San Francisco and San Diego during the last 100 years. Gradual sea level rise progressively worsens the impacts of high tides and the surge and waves associated with storms. The potential for impacts of future sea level rise was assessed from the occurrence of hourly sea level extremes. The occurrence of extreme events follows a sharply escalating pattern as the magnitude of future sea level rise increases. The confluence of low barometric pressures from storms and the presence large waves at the same time substantially increases the likelihood of high, damaging sea levels along the California coast. Similarly, astronomical tides and disturbances in sea level that are caused by weather and climate fluctuations are transmitted into the San Francisco Bay and Delta, and on into the lower reaches of the Sacramento River. In addition to elevating Bay and Delta sea levels directly through inverse barometer and wind effects, storms may generate heavy precipitation and high fresh water runoff and cause floods in the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, increasing the potential for inundation of levees and other structures. There may also be increased risk of levee failure due to the hydraulics and geometry of these structures. Rising sea levels from climate change will increase the frequency and duration of extremem high water levels, causing historical coastal and San Francisco Bay/Delta structure design criteria to be exceeded. \n",

            "abstract": "Summary of Key Findings and Recommendations\n\n - Climate change impacts will affect all of the sectors considered in this report: sea-level rise, agriculture, snowpack and water supply, forestry, wildfire risk, public health, and electricity demand and supply. \n\n - The more that greenhouse gases (GHGs) accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere over the next century, the greater the warming and the more severe and costly the impacts will be. This study considered three future GHG emissions scenarios - low, medium high, and high emissions - and explored associated climate changes through three modern climate models of differing sensitivity to GHG concentrations. \n\n - Although climate model results are inconclusive as to whether California's precipitation will change over the next century, all climate models show increases in temperature, with the aggregate of several model runs containing a range of warming from 2000 to 2100 from about +2 deg C to about +6 deg C (+3.6 deg F to about +10.8 deg F). Increases in temperature alone would impact the California hydrological cycle, with consequences upon the state's water supply, hydroelectric power supply, agriculture, recreation, and ecosystems. \n\n - Climate change could produce compounding impacts - for instance, in the San Francisco Bay Delta, heightened sea levels and high river inflows from warmer storms would place levee systems in greater jeopardy of flooding. \n\n - Some of the most dramatic climate change impacts will be experienced as increased freqeuncy and severity of extreme events, such as heat waves, wildfires, flooding, and conditions conducive to air pollution formation. \n\n - Even under lower GHG emissions scenarios, some impacts of climate change are inevitable. As a result, although adaptation is not the solution to climate change, it is a necessary complementary stategy to manage some of the projected impacts. \n\n - Although there are many opportunities for California to increase its capacity to cope with many climate change impacts, these can be costly, and they require time and planning. \n\n - More analysis - and in some cases, more information - is needed to better understand the vulnerability of California's health, economy, and environment to climate change. In particular, greater attention must focus on social dimensions of climate change for both assessing and implementing the state's mitigative and adaptive potential. Critical to this work will be evaluating and addressing the distributional and equity implications of climate changes in California. \n",

            "abstract": "This study examines the impact of greenhouse gas warming on soil moisture based on predictions of fifteen global climate models by comparing the after-stabilization climate in the SRESA1b experiment with the pre-industrial control climate. The models are consistent in predicting summer dryness and winter wetness in only part of the northern middle and high latitudes. Slightly over half of the models predict year-round wetness in central Eurasia and/or year-round dryness in Siberia and mid-latitude Northeast Asia. One explanation is offered that relates such lack of seasonality to the carry-over effect of soil moisture storage from season to season. In the tropics and subtropics, a decrease of soil moisture is the dominant response. The models are especially consistent in predicting drier soil over the US Southwest, the Mediterranean, Australia, and the South Africa in all seasons, and over much of the Amazon and West Africa in the JJA season and the Asian monsoon region in the DJF season. Since the only major areas of future wetness predicted with a high level of model consistency are part of the northern middle and high latitudes during the non-growing season, it is suggested that greenhouse gas warming will cause a worldwide agricultural drought. Over regions where there are considerable consistency among the analyzed models in predicting the sign of soil moisture changes, there is a wide range of magnitudes of the soil moisture response, indicating a high degree of model dependency in terrestrial hydrological sensitivity. A major part of the inter-model differences in the sensitivity of soil moisture response are attributable to differences in land surface parameterization.",

An urgent quesiton is: Are the IPCC AR4 projections substantially different from previous projections? An ensemble of 84 AR4 projections of California climate change from 12 models responding to 3 greenhouse-gas emission scenarios was resampled to estimate projection distribution functions (pdfs). An 18-member ensemble from the IPCC 3rd Assessment Report (AR3) was similarly evaluated. Comparisons of AR4 and AR3 pdfs show that scatter within the AR3 and AR4 temperature and precipitation ensembles do not noticeably differ by end of the 21st Century, despite the larger size of the AR4 ensemble; precipitation projections for northern California are even more stationary in AR4 than in AR3; and AR4 warmings are generally 0.85 deg C less than AR3 because of the different models and emissions scenarios used. \n",

            "abstract": "Ocean thermal expansion contributes signi&#64257;cantly to sea-level variability and rise. However, observed decadal variability in ocean heat content and sea level has not been reproduced well in climate models. Aerosols injected into the stratosphere during volcanic eruptions scatter incoming solar radiation, and cause a rapid cooling of the atmosphere and a reduction in rainfall, as well as other changes in the climate system. Here we use observations of ocean heat content and a set of climate simulations to show that large volcanic eruptions result in rapid reductions in ocean heat content and global mean sea level. For the Mt Pinatubo eruption, we estimate a reduction in ocean heat content of about 3 x 10^22 J and a global sea-level fall of about 5 mm. Over the three years following such an eruption, we estimate a decrease in evaporation of up to 0.1 mm d^-1, comparable to observed changes in mean land precipitation. The recovery of sea level following the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 explains about half of the difference between the long-term rate of sea-level rise of 1.8 mm yr^-1 (for 1950\u20132000), and the higher rate estimated for the more recent period where satellite altimeter data are available (1993\u20132000).

            "abstract": "The South Asian High (SAH) and precipitation over East Asia simulated by 11 coupled GCMs associated with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report are evaluated. The seasonal behavior of the SAH is presented for each model. Analyses of the results show that all models are able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of the SAH. Locations of the SAH center are also basically reproduced by these models. All models underestimate the intensity and the extension of coverage in summer. The anomalous SAH can be divided into east and west modes according to its longitudinal position in summer on the interannual timescale, and the composite anomalies of the observed precipitation for these two modes tend to have opposite signs over East Asia. However, only several coupled GCMs can simulate the relationship between rainfall and SAH similar to the observed one, which may be associated with the bias in simulation of the subtropical anticyclone over the West Pacific (SAWP) at 500 hPa. In fact, it is found that any coupled GCM, that can reproduce the reasonable summer mean state of SAWP and the southward (northward) withdrawal (extension) for the east (west) mode of SAH as compared to the observed, will also simulate similar rainfall anomaly patterns for the east and west SAH modes over East Asia. Further analysis indicates that the observed variations in the SAH, SAWP and rainfall are closely related to the sea surface temperature (SST) over the equatorial tropical Pacific. Particularly, some models cannot simulate the SAWP extending northward in the west mode and withdrawing southward in the east mode, which may be related to weak major El  Nino or La  events. The abilities of the coupled GCMs to simulate the SAWP and ENSO events are associated partly with their ability to reproduce the observed relationship between SAH and the rainfall anomaly over East Asia.",

The technique is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of local climate changes is only a function of the all-model mean global average warming. Although this is unlikely to be exactly true, cross-verification indicates that the resulting biases are more than compensated by the increased sample size provided by the method. The resulting forecasts for southern Finland suggest a 95% probability of annual mean warming and an 80% probability of increased annual mean precipitation from the years 1971-2000 to 2011-2020 under the SRES A1B emissions scenario. The choice of the emissions scenario is unimportant for such short-term forecasts but becomes gradually more important towards the late 21st century.  The simulations also suggest that the probability of near-term warming that is large enough to be discernible from internal variability is largest in the tropics where internal temperature variability is small, not in the Arctic where the average model-simulated warming is largest.

            "abstract": "Simulations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report\n(AR4) models on the Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation are assessed over the period 1950\u201399, focusing\non the seasonality of the trend and the level of its congruency with the southern annular mode (SAM) in\nterms of surface zonal wind stress. It is found that, as a group, the models realistically produce the\nseasonality of the trend, which is strongest in the SH summer season, December\u2013February (DJF). The\nmodeled DJF trend is principally congruent with the modeled SAM trend, as in observations. The majority\nof models produce a statistically significant positive trend, with decreasing westerlies in the midlatitudes and\nincreasing westerlies in the high latitudes. The trend pattern from an all-experiment mean achieves highest\ncorrelation with that from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data. A total of 48\nout of the 71 experiments were run with ozone-depletion forcing, which offers an opportunity to assess the\nimportance of ozone depletion in driving the late-twentieth-century trends. The AR4 model ensemble that\ncontains an ozone-depletion forcing produces an averaged trend that is comparable to the trend from the\nNCEP outputs corrected by station-based observations. The trend is largely generated after the mid-1970s.\nWithout ozone depletion the trend is less than half of that in the corrected NCEP, although the errors in\nthe observed trend are large. The impact on oceanic circulation is inferred from wind stress curl in the group\nwith ozone-depletion forcing. The result shows an intensification of the southern midlatitude supergyre\ncirculation, including a strengthening East Australian Current flowing through the Tasman Sea. Thus, ozone\ndepletion also plays an important role in the subtropical gyre circulation change over the past decades.",

            "abstract": "The estimated range of climate sensitivity has remained unchanged for decades and recently even increased, resulting in large uncertainties in long-term projections of future climate under increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we use the multi-thousand member ensemble of climate model simulations from the climateprediction.net project and a neural network to establish a relation between climate sensitivity and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in regional temperature. Most models with high sensitivities are found to overestimate the seasonal cycle compared to observations. A probability density function for climate sensitivity is then calculated from the present day seasonal cycle in reanalysis and instrumental datasets. Subject to a number of assumptions on the models and datasets used, we find that climate sensitivity is very unlikely (5% probability) to be either below  1.5 to 2 K or above about 5 to 6.5 K, with the best agreement found for sensitivities between 3 and 3.5 K.  This range is narrower than most probabilistic estimates derived from the observed 20th century warming. The current generation of general circulation models are within that range but do not sample the highest values.\n\n \n",

            "abstract": "In the 20th century, we have faced condition that green house gases (GHGs) concentration, particularly CO2, in the atmosphere has increased so tremendously. Regarding to the effects, IPCC (2001) has shown many proofs about the raising of global temperature and the changing of other climate parameters such as rainfall, humidity, etc. Generally, it gives specific influence to the distribution of rainfall patterns regionally or even locally. The study based on general idea to learn the relationship of the increasing of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere to the changing of rainfall patterns in Indonesia on regional and local point of views. \n\tIn the first part of our research, we were focusing our study in developing regionalization techniques. We have developed and practiced some of statistical downscaling methods and select the best method that statistically produces the best result on reconstructing Indonesian rainfall. The selected method also will be use to estimate the future rainfall based on GCMs scenario data as well as the historical rainfall. The study compared three statistical downscaling methods; they are Principal Component Regression (PCR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These methods were formulated using historical precipitable water (prw) data from different GCM models (CSIRO-Mk3.0, CGCM3.1, ECHAM5 and GFDL-CM2.0) which used to downscale the observation rainfall data in Aceh, Padang, Solok, Lampung, Jakarta, Kupang, Pontianak, and Ambon. We suggest that MARS method has given better performance rather than PCR and ANN methods. The study also found that the reducing of GCMs gridded data using principal component analysis for the six data of observed areas produces >80% of total variants for the first five or six components. The study of historical rainfall shown that in a century DJF rainfall pattern in Padang changed gradually as well as in Aceh on JJA and SON patterns, and in Jakarta on DJF pattern. \n",

            "abstract": "[1] Stratospheric sulfate aerosol particles from strong volcanic eruptions produce\nsignificant transient cooling of the troposphere and warming of the lower stratosphere. The\nradiative impact of volcanic aerosols also produces a response that generally includes an\nanomalously positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) that is most pronounced in\nthe boreal winter. The main atmospheric thermal and dynamical effects of eruptions\ntypical of the past century persist for about two years after each eruption. In this paper we\nevaluate the volcanic responses in simulations produced by seven of the climate models\nincluded in the model intercomparison conducted as part of the preparation of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).\nWe consider global effects as well as the regional circulation effects in the extratropical\nNorthern Hemisphere focusing on the AO responses forced by volcanic eruptions.\nSpecifically we analyze results from the IPCC historical runs that simulate the evolution of\nthe circulation over the last part of the 19th century and the entire 20th century using a\nrealistic time series of atmospheric composition (greenhouse gases and aerosols). In\nparticular, composite anomalies over the two boreal winters following each of the nine\nlargest low-latitude eruptions during the period 1860\u20131999 are computed for various\ntropospheric and stratospheric fields. These are compared when possible with\nobservational data. The seven IPCC models we analyzed use similar assumptions about\nthe amount of volcanic aerosols formed in the lower stratosphere following the volcanic\neruptions that have occurred since 1860. All models produce tropospheric cooling and\nstratospheric warming as in observations. However, they display a considerable range of\ndynamic responses to volcanic aerosols. Nevertheless, some general conclusions can be\ndrawn. The IPCC models tend to simulate a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in\nresponse to volcanic forcing similar to that typically observed. However, the associated\ndynamic perturbations and winter surface warming over Northern Europe and Asia in the\npost-volcano winters is much weaker in the models than in observations. The AR4\nmodels also underestimate the variability and long-term trend of the AO. This deficiency\naffects high-latitude model predictions and may have a similar origin. This analysis allows\nus to better evaluate volcanic impacts in up-to-date climate models and to better\nquantify the model Arctic Oscillation sensitivity to external forcing. This potentially could\nlead to improving model climate predictions in the extratropical latitudes of the Northern\nHemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Projections of changes in climate extremes are critical to assessing the potential impacts of climate change on human and natural systems. Modeling advances now provide the opportunity of utilizing global general circulation models (GCMs) for projections of extreme temperature and precipitation indicators. We analyze historical and future simulations of ten such indicators as derived from an ensemble of 8 GCMs contributing to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4), under a range of emissions scenarios. Our focus is on the consensus from the GCM ensemble, in terms of direction and significance of the changes, at the global average and geographical scale. The climate extremes described by the ten indices range from heat-wave frequency to frost-day occurrence, from dry-spell length to heavy rainfall amounts. Historical trends generally agree with previous observational studies, providing a basic sense of reliability for the GCM simulations. Projections for the 21st century are unanimous in confirming the changes in most temperature indices that are expected within a warmer climate, with differences in the spatial distribution of the changes and in the rates of the trends detected across scenarios. Depiction of a wetter world emerges unequivocally in the global averages of most of the precipitation indices. However, consensus and significance are less strong when regional patterns are concerned. This analysis provides a first overview of projected changes in climate extremes from the IPCC-AR4 model ensemble, and has significant implications with regard to climate projections for impact assessments.

Here we analyze a multi-model AOGCM data set to examine processes that produce the geographic pattern of these precipitation intensity changes over land. In the tropics, general increases in water vapor associated with positive SST anomalies in the warmer climate produce increased precipitation intensity over most land areas. In the midlatitudes, the pattern of precipitation intensity increase is related in part to the increased water vapor being carried to areas of mean moisture convergence to produce greater precipitation, as well as to changes in atmospheric circulation. Advective effects, indicated by sea level pressure changes, contribute to greatest precipitation intensity increases (as well as mean precipitation increases) over northwestern and northeastern North America, northern Europe, northern Asia, the east coast of Asia, southeastern Australia, and south-central South America.",

Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow. These models project 10\u201340% increases in runoff in eastern equatorial Africa, the La Plata basin and high-latitude North America and Eurasia, and 10\u201330% decreases in runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and mid-latitude western North America by the year 2050.

Seasonal extrema of low-latitude, hemispheric storage generally occur too early in the models, and model-specific errors in amplitude of the low-latitude annual variations are substantial.

Forcings and feedbacks that impact the warming response are estimated for both Arctic and global regions based on standard model diagnostics. Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks. Contributing to Arctic amplification are the Arctic-global differences in surface albedo feedback (SAF), longwave feedback and the net top-of-atmosphere flux forcing (the sum of the surface flux and the atmospheric heat transport convergence). The doubled CO2 forcing and non-SAF shortwave feedback oppose Arctic amplification. SAF is shown to be a contributing, but not a dominating, factor in the simulated Arctic amplification and its intermodel variation.",

Three-quarters of the model mean SAF comes from the Northern Hemisphere in roughly equal parts from the land and ocean areas. The remainder is due to Southern Hemisphere ocean areas.

            "abstract": "A simple technique is proposed for calculating global mean climate forcing from transient integrations of coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). This \u201cclimate forcing\u201d differs from the conventionally defined radiative forcing as it includes semidirect effects that account for certain short time scale responses in the troposphere. First, a climate feedback term is calculated from reported values of 2 \u00d7 CO2 radiative forcing and surface temperature time series from 70-yr simulations by 20 AOGCMs. In these simulations carbon dioxide is increased by 1% yr&#8722;1. The derived climate feedback agrees well with values that are diagnosed from equilibrium climate change experiments of slab-ocean versions of the same models. These climate feedback terms are associated with the fast, quasi-linear response of lapse rate, clouds, water vapor, and albedo to global surface temperature changes. The importance of the feedbacks is gauged by their impact on the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. Partial compensation is found between longwave and shortwave feedback terms that lessens the intermodel differences in the equilibrium climate sensitivity. There is also some indication that the AOGCMs overestimate the strength of the positive longwave feedback.\n\nThese feedback terms are then used to infer the shortwave and longwave time series of climate forcing in twentieth- and twenty-first-century simulations in the AOGCMs. The technique is validated using conventionally calculated forcing time series from four AOGCMs. In these AOGCMs the shortwave and longwave climate forcings that are diagnosed agree with the conventional forcing time series within &#8764;10%. The shortwave forcing time series exhibit order of magnitude variations between the AOGCMs, differences likely related to how both natural forcings and/or anthropogenic aerosol effects are included. There are also factor of 2 differences in the longwave climate forcing time series, which may indicate problems with the modeling of well-mixed greenhouse gas changes. The simple diagnoses presented provides an important and useful first step for understanding differences in AOGCM integrations, indicating that some of the differences in model projections can be attributed to different prescribed climate forcing, even for so-called standard climate change scenarios.\n",

This condition indicates that the need of soybean in Indonesia can be a serious problem of agricultural sector in the future. Furthermore, the climate change issue as a result of human activity used a large amount of fosil fuel will derive a new problem for agricultural sector which requires a better strategy of anticipation. This point out the important of information in order to estimate the potential of soybean\u2019s yield in Indoensia in the future. \nIn general, this research is designed to identify the evidence of climate change and to learn the impact of the climate change scenarios on the future of soybean\u2019s yield in Bandung district. For this purpose, literature study and analysis of global circulation model (data) data are applied for identifying the occurrence of climate change. Then, the impact analysis of these scenarios on soybean\u2019s yield is conducted by using climate and agricultural simulation model, which consist of statistic and mechanistic models.\n Analysis of the earth surface mean temperature shows the increasing of global air temperature has been started since 19\u2019s century with the occurence of increasing temperature from about -0.4 oC to about 0.1 oC in the year of 1940\u2019s. Then, the occurence of climate change in Indonesia can be identified using monthly rainfall data for a certain period. Previous study, which has been conducted by kaimuddin (2000) shows the changing of rainfall pattern in Indonesia.\nAdditionally, analysis on GCM data for various climate change scenarios reveal the evidence of rainfall and temperature changing variability in percentage for each model in 2020, 2050 and 2080. The highest value of A2 scenario in come from NIESS, meanwhile for B2 scenario is GFDL. Then, the minimum value is mostly gained from ECHAM model. Moreover, the result of simulation using  maximum and minimum value from those scenario  for year 2020 decrease in almost of the whole area of Bandung.\n",

            "title": "Assessing snow albedo feedback in simulated climate change",
            "abstract": "We isolate and quantify the two factors controlling Northern Hemisphere springtime snow albedo feedback in transient climate change based on scenario runs of 17 climate models used in the IPCC 4th Assessment.  The first factor is the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo, representing the atmosphere's attenuation effect on surface albedo anomalies.  It is potentially a major source of divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback because of large differences in simulated cloud fields in Northern Hemisphere land areas.  To calculate it, we develop an analytical model governing planetary albedo.  We show detailed validation of the analytical model for two of the simulations, CCSM3.0 and CM2.0, demonstrating that it facilitates highly accurate calculation of the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo given readily-available simulation output.  We find in all simulations surface albedo anomalies are attenuated by approximately half in Northern Hemisphere land areas as they are transformed into planetary albedo anomalies.   The intermodel standard deviation in this factor is surprisingly small, less than 10% of the mean.  Moreover, when we calculate an observational estimate of this factor by applying the same method to the satellite-based ISCCP data, we find most simulations agree with ISCCP values to within about 10%, in spite of further disagreements between observed and simulated cloud fields.  This suggests even large relative errors in simulated cloud fields do not result in significant error in this factor, enhancing confidence in climate models.  The second factor, related exclusively to surface processes, is the change in surface albedo associated with an anthropogenically-induced temperature change in Northern Hemisphere land areas.  It exhibits much more intermodel variability.  Its standard deviation is about 1/3 of the mean, with the largest value being approximately three times larger than the smallest.  Therefore this factor is unquestionably the main source of the large divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback.  To reduce the divergence, attention should be focused on differing parameterizations of snow processes, rather than intermodel variations in the attenuation effect of the atmosphere on surface albedo anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Differences in simulations of climate feedbacks are sources of significant divergence in climate models' temperature response to anthropogenic forcing.  Snow albedo feedback is particularly critical for climate change prediction in heavily-populated northern hemisphere land masses.  Here we show its strength in current models exhibits a factor-of-three spread.  These large intermodel variations in feedback strength in climate change are nearly perfectly correlated with comparably large intermodel variations in feedback strength in the context of the seasonal cycle.  Moreover, the feedback strength in the real seasonal cycle can be measured and compared to simulated values.  These mostly fall outside the range of the observed estimate, suggesting many models have an unrealistic snow albedo feedback in the seasonal cycle context.  Because of the tight correlation between simulated feedback strength in the seasonal cycle and climate change, eliminating the model errors in the seasonal cycle will lead directly to a reduction in the spread of feedback strength in climate change.  Though this comparison to observations may put the models in an unduly harsh light because of uncertainties in the observed estimate that are difficult to quantify, our results map out a clear strategy for targeted observation of the seasonal cycle to reduce divergence in simulations of climate sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "We examine the annular mode within each hemisphere (defined here as the leading empirical orthogonal function and principal component of hemispheric sea level pressure) as simulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ensembles of coupled ocean-atmosphere models. The simulated annular patterns exhibit a high spatial correlation with the observed patterns during the late 20th century, though the mode represents too large a percentage of total temporal variability within each hemisphere. In response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols, the multimodel average exhibits a positive annular trend in both hemispheres, with decreasing sea level pressure (SLP) over the pole and a compensating increase in midlatitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trend agrees in sign but is of smaller amplitude than that observed during recent decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, decreasing stratospheric ozone causes an additional reduction in Antarctic surface pressure during the latter half of the 20th century. While annular trends in the multimodel average are positive, individual model trends vary widely. Not all models predict a decrease in high-latitude SLP, although no model exhibits an increase. As a test of the models' annular sensitivity, the response to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is calculated during the winter following five major tropical eruptions. The observed response exhibits coupling between stratospheric anomalies and annular variations at the surface, similar to the coupling between these levels simulated elsewhere by models in response to increasing GHG concentration. The multimodel average is of the correct sign but significantly smaller in magnitude than the observed annular anomaly. This suggests that the models underestimate the coupling of stratospheric changes to annular variations at the surface and may not simulate the full response to increasing GHGs.",

We compare Sahel rainfall in the 20th century, pre-industrial, and increased greenhouse gases (GHG) simulations produced for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The simulations forced by 20th century concentrations of aerosol and GHG reproduce (i) a global change in SST akin to that associated with Sahel drought and (ii) a correspondent drying of the Sahel. We conclude that late 20th century Sahel climate was significantly dryer than pre-industrial, and at least 30% of the drying was externally forced. Comparison between 20th century runs and runs forced by GHG alone reveals the key role of reflective aerosols: they force a gradient in SST that excites robust drying in the northern edge of the Atlantic Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in the Sahel.

            "title": "COMPARISONS  BETWEEN OBSERVED AND MODELED PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE EXTREMES IN SOUTH AMERICA DURING THE XX CENTURY (IPCC AR4 MODELS)",
            "abstract": "One of the key aspects of Climate Change is to understand the behavior of extremes. It is recognized that the changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events are likely to have a larger impact than changes in mean climate. We propose to assess the expected changes in climate extremes over southern South America through the analysis of the indices of the IPCC 4th Assessment Model Output for the present climate (IPCC20C3M). These \"extreme indices\" are derived data, from simulated daily temperature and precipitation, in the form of annual indicator time series. In this paper, for the common period 1960-2000, the mean, standard deviation and mean square error between the grid point from different models and the nearest station was calculated. The indices that could be comparable are: FD: annual occurrence of frost days (days with MinT <0\u00baC), Tn90: percentage of days where MinT was above the 90th percentile of the 1961-90 base period. R10: number of heavy precipitation days > 10mm (R10), CDD: consecutive dry days  and R5D: maximum 5-day precipitation.  The available models are CCSM3 (CCSM),USA CNRM-CM3, (CNRM), France GFDL-CM2 .0 (GFDL0) GFDL-CM2.1 (GFDL), USA, INM-CM3.0-Russia (INM), MIROC high-resolution MIROC), MIROC medre-resolution (MIRMED), Japan, and PCM, USA (PCM)\nIn general, it is necessary to think that the values of the models on the Andes cannot be evaluated by the failing of the models in interpreting the orography. If we center the analysis in the Southeast of South America,  a low land region  which has more dense information, one sees that the average value is well simulated, the station values has similar values over regions, and are of the same order of magnitude, as in case of the models. In some cases, as the model GFDL, FD's average values are well simulated. The interannual variability from days to weeks in average, also is in good agreement.  Another temperature extreme, a warm one, Tn90, (being an index percentile-based, is relative to the local climate), It seems to be better represented that the FD. The consecutive dry days are more difficult to be simulated, since the region has a marked precipitation gradient that is not properly represented. The maximums of dryness over central Argentina Andes could not be represented for any model. On the other hand, the extensive dry season of the Amazon, is displeased and exaggerated in GFDL, whereas it does not exist for CCSM3. An index that measures the quantity of extreme rainfall, (R5d) shows in all the models that the quantity of rainfall is underestimated and there the differences of rate of rainfall are not clear. The one that better approaches the average values is the MIROC3.2. When the number of days is evaluated by extreme rainfall (R10), without considering how much it precipitated, the maps are more similar. The Amazon interannual variability is well  simulated.\n",

It is found that the ENSO amplitude amplifies as the CO2 concentration increases, then weakens once the concentration is held fixed at 2xCO2 level in the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) model simulation, but with no significant sensitivity in the other five models. By comparing the MRI and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamical Laboratory (GFDL) models, both of which simulate ENSO reasonably well for the unperturbed climate, we investigate the origin of the sensitivity or lack of sensitivity of the ENSO amplitude to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. It is found that in the MRI model the oceanic sensitivity to the equatorial zonal wind stress is significantly decreased in the doubled CO2 period compared to the transient period. Moreover, the vertical stratification at upper levels is weaker in the former period than in the latter period. However, these changes in the GFDL model are negligible.",

            "abstract": "The global energy cycle between the land and the ocean has been studied with simulations of the 20th century performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. The energy cycle consists of the net energy fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and the surface, the atmospheric energy storage rates over the global land and ocean, and the atmospheric energy transport between the land and ocean. The energy cycle was investigated using a multi-model ensemble for its centennial mean, climatological annual variation and long-term trend. Some distinctive features of the cycle were revealed: (1) the ocean-to-land atmospheric energy transport plays a key role in partitioning the global net TOA flux between the ocean and land, (2) the annual variation of the global net TOA flux is primarily attributed by the ocean surface flux, and (3) it is ascertained that the planetary energy imbalance on the long-term period is induced by the ocean\u2019s heat uptake.

            "title": "Intrinsic Versus Forced Variation in Coupled Climate Model Simulations over the Arctic during the 20th Century",
            "abstract": "There were two major multi-year, Arctic-wide (60-90&#61616;N) warm anomalies (> 0.7&#61616;C) in land surface air temperature (LSAT) during the 20th century, between 1920-1950 and again at the end of the century (after 1979). Reproducing this decadal variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, but with considerable variability in magnitude among models. Eight models generated warm anomalies at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization but not their timing. However, the durations of the early warm event in all the models are shorter than the observed.  Large region-to-region, year-to-year, ensemble to ensemble, and model to model variability are seen in the simulations. These results suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability, and one should not expect each ensemble member to have a year-to-year correspondence to the observed time series. Further, the variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations. Five models compare favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly magnitude in their 20C3M simulation. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data. ",

            "abstract": "Empirical studies show that the frequency distribution, n_P, with respect to daily precipitation amount, P, can for a large number of location be approximated by an exponential law, n_P is proportional to exp(m P), with negative values for the exponential coefficient, m. Furthermore, the exponential coefficient is not a constant but varies from location to location and exhibits a systematic relationship with the local mean temperature and precipitation as well as other geographical parameters. These properties allow an estimation of extreme values in form of high percentiles, once the mean conditions are known. Furthermore, given changes in the mean local climate, it is possible to infer changes in the extremes. A new multi-model ensemble of the most recent climate simulations, carried out for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, due to be published in 2007 (the fourth assessment report - AR4), has been subject to empirical-statistical downscaling and provides best-estimates for the continuing trends in mean temperatures and precipitation in northern Europe. These scenarios are used in conjunction with the established relationship between the exponential coefficient m of the distribution function on the one hand, and local mean temperature and precipitation for year 2050 based on previous work on the other, to infer changes in the 95-percentiles of the rainfall for year 2050. This approach is different to previous work based on regional climate models or more traditional means of statistical downscaling applied directly to climate extreme indices. This new independent analysis points towards an increase in the number of extreme precipitation events and very slight change in the number of rainy days over large parts of the Nordic countries.",

            "abstract": "Large scale changes in the sea level pressure do not necessary reflect changes in the atmospheric moisture budget, and hence may not give a good representation of changes in precipitation as a result of a global warming. Statistical models using both sea level pressure and large-scale precipitation as predictor are evaluated for a number of locations in Fennoscandia. The statistical models in most cases were capable of capturing 60%--80% of the year-to-year seasonal variations in precipitation and a correlation analysis over independent data indicated predictive skills scores in the range 0.2--0.5. A comparison between statistical models based on large-scale precipitation, sea level pressure, and a mixture of these, indicated similar skills in terms of variance and predictive skill of inter-annual variations. Analyses of their ability to capture recent precipitation trends reveal potential problems regarding reconstructing long-term changes in the past. One explanation for why the statistical models do not give similar past trend values as the station observations may partly be that precipitation trends during the most recent 50 years are not well defined because the interval is not sufficiently long. This is supported by the fact that trend analysis for station observations based on two different data products, and different trend-analysis strategies do not correspond well with each other. An analysis of possible non-stationarities between large and local spatial scales does not indicate significant presence of non-stationarities.",

            "abstract": "The amount of solar irradiance reaching the surface is a key parameter in the hydrological and energy cycles of the Earth's climate. We analyze 20th Century simulations using nine state-of-the-art climate models and show that all models estimate a global annual mean reduction in downward surface solar radiation of 1-4 W/m2 at the same time that the globe warms by 0.4-0.7\u00b0\u00a6 C. In single forcing simulations using the GISS-ER model, this \"global dimming\" signal is shown to be predominantly related to aerosol effects. In the global mean sense the surface adjusts to changes in downward solar flux instantaneously by reducing the upward fluxes of longwave, latent and sensible heat. Adding increased greenhouse gas forcing traps outgoing longwave radiation in the atmosphere and surface which results in net heating (although reduced) that is consistent with global warming over the 20th Century. Over the 1984-2000 period, individual model simulations show widely disparate results, mostly related to cloud changes associated with tropical Pacific variations, similar to the changes inferred from the satellite data analysis. This suggests that this time period is not sufficient to determine longer term trends.",

            "abstract": "The response of water vapor and clouds to El Ni\u00f1o warming over the tropical Pacific in the most recent three versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model (CAM2, T42 CAM3, and T85 CAM3) is quantified and compared to observations. It is found that all three models have a stronger response in the greenhouse effect of water vapor than that indicated in Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. The overestimate is most severe in the T85 CAM3 (up to 36%). Compared with National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, all three models have an excessive response of atmospheric moisture content in the upper troposphere, suggesting a cause for the excessive response in the greenhouse effect of water vapor. The response in the greenhouse effect of clouds (the longwave forcing of clouds) in two of the models (CAM2 and T42 CAM3) is significantly weaker than that indicated in ERBE observations, but it is comparable to the observed in the T85 CAM3. The improvement in the T85 CAM3 in simulating the response in the greenhouse effect is helped by a stronger response in the middle level clouds in the model (compared to CAM2 and T42 CAM3). In contrast to the strong negative response in the shortwave forcing seen in the ERBE observations, the response of the shortwave forcing of clouds in the CAM2 and the T42 CAM3 is weak and even has a sign opposite to observations when it is averaged over the entire region of surface warming. The simulation of the response of the shortwave forcing in the T85 CAM3 is considerably improved, though the negative response over the equatorial Pacific is still not strong enough compared to ERBE observations. The stronger negative response in the shortwave forcing in the T85 CAM3 is apparently linked to a stronger response in the middle level cloud cover. All three models fail to simulate the observed pattern of the response in the low cloud cover over the central and eastern Pacific, resulting in deficiency in the response of the shortwave cloud forcing in that region. The deficiency in the low cloud cover response suggests that the low cloud cover scheme has room for improvement.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the analysis of winter (October-November-December-January-\nFebruary-March; ONDJFM) storm events and their changes due to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations over Europe. In order to assess uncertainties that are due to model formulation, 4 regional climate models (RCMs) with 5 high resolution experiments, and 4 global general circulation models (GCMs) are considered. Firstly, cyclone systems as synoptic scale processes in winter are investigated, as they are a principal cause of the occurrence of extreme, damage-causing wind speeds. This is achieved by use of an objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm applied to GCMs. Secondly, changes in extreme near-surface wind speeds are analysed. Based on\npercentile thresholds, the studied extreme wind speed indices allow a consistent analysis over Europe that takes systematic deviations of the models into account. Relative changes in both intensity and frequency of extreme winds and their related uncertainties are assessed and related to changing patterns of extreme cyclones. A common feature of all investigated GCMs is a reduced track density over central Europe under climate change conditions, if all systems are considered. If only extreme (i.e. the strongest 5%) cyclones are taken into account, an increasing cyclone activity for western parts of central Europe is apparent; however, the climate change signal reveals a reduced spatial coherency when compared to all systems, which exposes partially contrary results. With respect to extreme wind speeds, significant positive changes in intensity and frequency are obtained over at least 3 and 20% of the European domain under study (35\u201372\u00b0 N and 15\u00b0W\u201343\u00b0 E), respectively. \nLocation and extension of the affected areas (up to 60 and 50% of the domain for intensity and frequency, respectively), as well as levels of changes (up to +15 and +200% for intensity and frequency, respectively) are shown to be highly dependent on the driving GCM, whereas differences between RCMs when driven by the same GCM are relatively small.",

Volcanically induced cooling of the ocean surface penetrated into deeper layers, where it persisted for decades after the event. This remarkable effect on oceanic thermal structure is longer lasting than has previously been suspected and is sufficient to offset a large fraction of ocean warming and sea-level rise caused by anthropogenic influences.  An oceanic response to the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, which was comparable to Krakatoa in terms of its radiative forcing, has been identified in satellite altimetry data. The simulated heat-content recovery after Pinatubo seems to occur much more rapidly than for Krakatoa. This disparity arises because the Pinatubo response is superimposed on a non-stationary background of large and increasing greenhouse-gas forcing. The heat-content effects of Pinatubo and other eruptions in the late twentieth century are offset by the observed warming of the upper ocean, which is primarily due to anthropogenic influences.\n",

Our primary objective is to evaluate a recent suite of coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations of the twentieth century in the context of available observations. In support of this objective, we extend the analysis and interpretation of observational estimates. In many respects, the collection of models examined compare well with observations. The largest signal in the annual cycle of ocean heat content is in the midlatitudes, where all the models do a credible job of capturing the amplitude, phasing, and depth penetration. Judging the models' performance at high latitudes is more complex because of the sparseness of observations and complications owing to the presence of sea ice.

            "abstract": "The ability of the climate model simulations performed for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in reproducing the leading patterns of atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and their influence on precipitation variability in South America are discussed here, using the same subset of the climate simulations of the 20th century (20c3m) described in Part I. CMAP precipitation dataset and NCEP-NCAR reanalyses were used to describe the observed patterns. The leading patterns of circulation in the SH were identified through an analysis of the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) for the 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies over the SH, southward of 20\u00b0S.  Regression and correlation maps were computed for observations and model simulations. For those models that an ensemble of runs are available, the maps were first computed per individual run and then averaged over all runs available for each model.\n\nIt was found that all models are able to reproduce a first leading pattern resembling the SAM. On the other hand, just some of them can reproduce PSA-like structure associated with the second and third leading patterns. The analysis suggests that GFDL, GISS and MPI are the models that reproduce patterns more similar to those observed. Regarding the observed relationship between ENSO and SH circulation anomalies and precipitation anomalies in South America, it was found that most of the model second leading patterns are significantly correlated with ENSO. Nevertheless, there is considerable dispersion among models regarding the ENSO amplitude and the SH circulation response to ENSO. It was also found not only for model results but also for NCEP, that both ENSO-related signal and that of SAM were projected onto more than one EOF. This result can be associated with limitations in the EOF technique in separating physical modes and/or sampling errors associated with the length of the period considered. The relationship between monthly mean precipitation anomalies and the three leading patterns of SH circulation variability show that most of the models reproduced the SAM influence onto precipitation variability at the southern Andes. On the other hand, just a few of them were able to reproduce the observed influence of both PSA1 and PSA2 on South American precipitation variability. The last result can be associated with model deficiencies in reproducing the ENSO cycle and its remote influence on the SH circulation variability. \n\n",

Each is also simulating various key aspects of the observed ice cover distributions, such as winter ice not only throughout the central Arctic basin but also throughout Hudson Bay, despite its relatively low latitudes. However, some of the models simulate too much ice, others too little ice (in some cases depending on hemisphere and/or season), and some match the observations better in one season versus another. Several models do noticeably better in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, and one does noticeably better in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere all simulate monthly average ice extents to within + 5.1 x 106 km2 of the observed ice extent throughout the year; and in the Southern Hemisphere all except one simulate the monthly averages to within + 6.3 x 106 km2 of the observed values. All the models properly simulate a lack of winter ice to the west of Norway; however, most do not obtain as much absence of ice immediately north of Norway as the observations show, suggesting an under simulation of the North Atlantic Current. The spread in monthly averaged ice extents among the 11 model simulations is greater in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere and greatest in the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring",

The climate scenarios are constructed for the target years 2050 and 2100, for both a moderate and a large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature. The climate scenarios contain contributions from changes in ocean density (thermal expansion) and changes in ocean mass (melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps, changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and terrestrial water-storage contributions). All major components depend on the global temperature rise achieved in the target periods considered. The resulting set of climate scenarios represents our best estimate of twenty-first century sea level rise in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, given the current understanding of the various contributions.  This set meets the requirements of policy-makers and at the same time does justice to scientific uncertainties.",

For current climate conditions, the subtropical part of the meridional mode is reasonably well simulated, in contrast to the deep tropical part of the meridional mode and the zonal mode. A common model bias is that the onset of the meridional mode is preceded by the presence of a zonal mode in boreal fall that extends towards the western boundary of the Atlantic basin and which initiates a Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback. As a result of this, there is a spuriously strong interaction between the zonal and the meridional mode. The models that best represent the meridional mode show a weakening for future climate conditions. Biases in the zonal mode are too strong to assess changes.",

Using statistical analysis we\nobserve Bjerknes compensation on decadal timescales at latitudes in between\n50N and 80N. A maximum compensation rate of 55% occurs at 70N. At this\nlatitude the correlation rate peaks when the ocean is leading the atmosphere\nby one year. The mechanisms by which Bjerknes compensation occurs at this\nlatitude are investigated. Anomalies in oceanic heat transport appear to be\nassociated with variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional\noverturning circulation (MOC). The associated sea surface temperature (SST)\nanomalies are in general too weak to assert a significant impact on the\natmosphere. At 60N however, such SST anomalies prelude the transition from\nsea-ice coverage to open water after which the associated changes in heat\nexchange with the atmosphere are strong enough to force an atmospheric\nresponse. Due to the presence of a strong MOC component in the Atlantic ocean,\nthis interaction is confined to the region where the Northeast Atlantic and\nArctic Ocean connect. The atmospheric response to increased (decreased)\nheating from below is a decreased (increased) poleward temperature gradient,\nleading to a decreased (increased) heat transport by baroclinic eddies.\nThe direct impact of MOC-variations on sea-ice coverage in the Labrador Sea\nis too weak to induce an atmospheric response there, which initially stays\nconfined to the Northeast Atlantic. The anomalous thermal low (high) that is\nset-up by heating (cooling) from the ocean is associated with anomalous\nadvection of cold air from the Greenland land-mass, which eventually may\ntrigger(halt) the intermittent convection in the Irminger Sea. The associated\nSST-anomalies are quickly advected by the Greenland Current into the Labrador\nSea where they have a similar impact on sea-ice coverage as the more direct\nresponse of the Northeast Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "A suite of climate model experiments indicates that 20th Century increases in ocean heat content and sea-level (via thermal expansion) were substantially reduced by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. The volcanically-induced cooling of the ocean surface is subducted into deeper ocean layers, where it persists for decades. Temporary reductions in ocean heat content associated with the comparable eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (1982) and Pinatubo (1991) were much shorter lived because they occurred relative to a non-stationary background of large, anthropogenically-forced ocean warming. Our results suggest that inclusion of the effects of Krakatoa (and perhaps even earlier eruptions) is important for reliable simulation of 20th century ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion. Inter-model differences in the oceanic thermal response to Krakatoa are large and arise from differences in external forcing, model physics, and experimental design. Systematic experimentation is required to quantify the relative importance of these factors. The next generation of historical forcing experiments may require more careful treatment of pre-industrial volcanic aerosol loadings. \n\n",

Climate models consistently predict an increase in\nthe variability of summer temperatures in these areas, but the\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for this increase remain\nuncertain. Here we explore these mechanisms using regional\nsimulations of recent and future climatic conditions with and\nwithout land\u2013atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate that\nthe increase in summer temperature variability predicted in\ncentral and eastern Europe is mainly due to feedbacks between\nthe land surface and the atmosphere.

These findings emphasize the\nimportance of soil-moisture\u2013temperature feedbacks (in addition\nto soil-moisture\u2013precipitation feedbacks) in influencing summer\nclimate variability and the potential migration of climate\nzones with strong land\u2013atmosphere coupling as a consequence\nof global warming.

The coupled climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offer a unique cross-section of model formulations, resolutions and scenarios with which to explore climate models\u2019 ability to produce GSAs. The performance of nine different models, with a range of horizontal and vertical atmospheric and oceanic resolutions, in producing GSAs was examined using a base period of 100 years. One scenario was a pre-industrial control simulation, while the other was forced by an increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide of an enhanced greenhouse world (scenario sresa1b). It was found that the strongest control on the existence of model GSAs was the oceanic horizontal resolution. This needed to be of the order of 1.5o or less for GSAs to occur within the model. In those models which possessed GSAs these were overwhelmingly generated within the Labrador Sea, with similar periodicities to those observed. Anomalies reaching the Greenland Sea through the Nordic Sea gyre circulations generally slowed and died before propagating back into the Atlantic. Freshwater flow through the Canadian Archipelago appears to be an important factor in producing the most realistic simulation. Within the greenhouse world GSAs were significantly less likely to occur, were weaker and more likely to originate from east of Greenland. ",

            "abstract": "The surface albedos simulated by seventeen climate models over the northern latitudes of the Western Hemisphere were compared with satellite-derived albedo products provided by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). Model simulations were conducted in support of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Results show the following: (1) Annual albedo of the region averaged for all models is fairly close to that provided by the ISCCP (0.351 versus 0.334). The difference between model average and ISCCP albedos is well below the standard deviation in albedo among models. (2) Most models simulated seasonal variations in regional albedo reasonably well. In summer, the models systematically overestimated albedo relative to the ISCCP data by as much as 0.05. In winter, large differences were detected among the climate models. (3) The spatial correlations among models, and between models and ISCCP, depend on geographic location, season and surface type. In general, the spatial correlation coefficients between individual models and the ISCCP data were highest for the land surface in midsummer and for the ocean surface in spring. Model bias was smaller for the ocean surface than for the land surface, and smaller in summer than in winter. (4) Unlike the modeling results, the satellite data showed large interannual variations in albedo and a systematic decreasing trend over the 16 year period of 1984\u20131999. Depending on season, the standard deviation of albedo interannual variation ranged from 0.036 to 0.074, and the linear regression slope of the decreasing trend ranged from -0.02 to -0.05 per decade according to ISCCP results. The large interannual variation and decreasing trend are not reflected in model simulations. Additional efforts are still required to improve surface albedo simulations in GCMs and its mapping from satellite",

            "abstract": "The identification of clear-sky and cloudy pixels is a key step in the processing of satellite observations. This is equally important for surface and cloud-atmosphere applications. In this paper, we present the SPARC (Separation of Pixels using Aggregated Rating over Canada) algorithm, a new method of pixel identification for image data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the NOAA satellites. The SPARC algorithm separates image pixels into clear-sky and cloudy categories based on a specially designed rating scheme. A mask depicting snow/ice and cloud shadows is also generated. The SPARC algorithm has been designed to work year round (day and night) over the temperate and polar regions of North America, for current and historical AVHRR/NOAA High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) and Local Area Coverage (LAC) data with original 1-km spatial resolution. The algorithm was tested and applied to data from the AVHRR sensors flown onboard NOAA-6 to NOAA-18. The method was employed in generating historical clear-sky composites for the 1982-2005 period at daily, 10-day and monthly time-scales at 1-km resolution for an area of 5700\u00d74800 km2 centered over Canada. This region also covers the northern part of the United States including Alaska, as well as Greenland and the surrounding oceans.\nThe SPARC algorithm is designed to produce an aggregated rating that accumulates the results of several tests. The magnitude of the rating serves as an indicator of the probability for a pixel to belong to clear-sky, partly cloudy or overcast categories. The individual tests employ the spectral properties of 5 AVHRR channels, as well as surface the skin temperature maps from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset. These temperature fields are available at 32\u00d732 km2 spatial resolution and at 3 hour time intervals. Combining all test results into one final rating for each pixel is beneficial for the generation of multi-scene clear-sky composites. The selection of the best pixel to be used in the final clear-sky product is based on the magnitude of the rating. This provides much improved results relative to other approaches or \u201cyes/no\u201d decision methods.\nThe SPARC method has been compared to the results of supervised classification for a number of AVHRR scenes representing various seasons (snow-free summer, winter with snow/ice coverage and transition seasons). The results show an overall agreement between the automated (SPARC) and the supervised classification at the level of 80 % to 91 %.",

            "abstract": "This study defines the concepts of wind onset and wind withdrawal to describe the abrupt variations of wind direction and circulation of the Asian monsoon. The patterns of wind onset and withdrawal show that the earliest wind onset in monsoon regions is found over equator around 70\u00b0-100\u00b0E, the wind retreat contrast to the wind onset shown a southward progression in tropics. In addition, a notable temporal boundary is found around 25\u00b0N in the subtropical western North Pacific, which may be related to the northward advance and southward retreat of the western Pacific subtropical high. The rotational amplitudes of wind vector in wind onset and withdrawal have regional differences in Asian monsoon regions. Since the process of monsoon onset (withdrawal) may include abruptions of several variables without simultaneity, the relationships of the dates of onset and withdrawal with the abrupt time of other variables (e.g. reversal of zonal wind, OLR, precipitation) are investigated. The results indicate the temporal differences in different monsoon regions confirmed the asynchronous abruption. It also implies that the wind onset might be a good omen for monsoon precipitation in some regions since it is slightly earlier than rainy season onset. Seven model results from AMIP AR4 are validated against observations mentioned above. On the whole, most models appear to more correctly reproduce the broad features of the wind withdrawal than those of the wind onset. For wind onset, IAP-FGOALS-1.0g, MIROC3.2 (medres) and MPI-ECHAM5 simulate reasonably well. For wind retreats, most models can capture the behaviors in tropics. However, there are still notable shortcomings in some models to simulate this transitional characteristic of wind direction in monsoon onset and withdrawal which need further improvement.",

            "abstract": "Based on the seasonal reversal of wind vector which is the essential characteristic of monsoon, a new concept, the directed angle, is introduced to study rotational regimes of global wind vector and monsoon annul variability. Compared with the previous studies using angle between wind vectors, this concept better reflects the daily variations of wind direction including the rotational direction and amplitude. According to the concept, six categories of wind vector rotation with seasonal cycle have been detected and classified as follows: (I) Clockwise to counter-clockwise rotation; (II) Counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation; (III) Full clockwise rotation; (IV) Full counter-clockwise rotation; (V) Stable style; (VI) Instable style. In monsoon regions, the wind generally rotates in the forms of the first four categories with seasonal evolution. The global distribution pattern of wind vector rotation regime shows that different rotational styles of wind vector are closely related to seasonal evolution of atmospheric circulation systems, including the strength and movement of trough and ridge, the development, movement and split of anticyclone or cyclone, as well as the seasonal variation of solar radiation. Moreover, different monsoon systems possess different wind vector rotational styles with seasonal evolution, for instance, the South Asian monsoon is the style II while the East Asian monsoon is the style IV, the style I is showed in the South China Sea, and the style III in the South Indo-China Peninsula and the West Africa. In addition, this study\nemployed this new concept to evaluate the model outputs of 8 AGCMs of AMIP in\nIPCC 4th assessment. The results show that this application not only reflects the dynamic process and global distribution of wind vector rotational styles in monsoon simulation, but also embodies the abilities for AGCMs to reproducing circulation seasonal variations. In general, most models show the global distribution pattern reasonable well compared to the corresponding observations, but so little skill is shown in the monsoon rotational styles of some models, especially in South China Sea and West Africa. Moreover, the simulations differ mostly from observations during the transitional season.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture trends, particularly during the growing season, are an important possible consequence of global warming.  Climate model simulations of future soil moisture changes should be made with models that can produce reliable simulations of soil moisture for past climate changes.  In this paper, we compare soil moisture simulations from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment climate models forced with observed climate forcings for the past century, and evaluate them using in situ soil moisture measurements from over 140 stations or districts in mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.  To account for the observed spatial scale of soil moisture variations, we used regionally-averaged soil moisture for six regions.  The models showed realistic seasonal cycles for Ukraine, Russia, and Illinois, but generally poor seasonal cycles for Mongolia and China.  \n\tTo explore the summer drying issue for the second half of the 20th century, we analyzed the linear trend of soil moisture for Ukraine and Russia.  Observations from both regions show increases in summer for the period from 1958-1999 that were larger than most trends in the model simulations.  Only two out of 25 model realizations show trends comparable to those of observations.  These two trends, however, are due to internal model variability rather than a result of external forcing.  Changes in precipitation and temperature cannot fully explain soil moisture increases for Ukraine and Russia, which indicates that other factors might have played a dominant role on the observed patterns for soil moisture.  We suggest that changes in solar irradiance (the dimming effect) and resultant changes in evaporative demand explain most of the observed soil moisture trends.  To understand such sensitivity, we analyzed soil moisture outputs in a special version of the ECHAM5 model that was capable of capturing the observed radiation pattern as a result of incorporating a sophisticated aerosol scheme.  Results suggest that both radiation and precipitation patterns are required to be adequately simulated to reproduce the observed soil moisture trends realistically. \n",

            "abstract": "Distribution changes in seasonal mean 2m temperature are investigated in Central Europe and the extratropical northern Hemisphere for the most recent period 1961-2005 and the 21st century. Data from both observations and climate model runs are used. The latter are taken from scenarios prepared for the fourth IPCC assessment report (AR4). All data sets and model runs are scaled by their corresponding interannual variability to facilitate the comparison between the datasets. Time series are detrended to investigate changes in internal variability. For the last 45 years (1961-2005) the strongest changes in mean are found for in the summer mean temperature, both in observations and AR4 runs. With the exception of autumn, changes in the mean are captured reasonably well by the models on the regional as well as hemispheric scale. For Central Europe, estimates for variability changes show a weak increase (decrease) in summer (winter) observations. Both are not statistically significant at the 10% level. For the 21st century all climate scenario runs suggest large relative increases in mean temperature for all seasons. The AR4 model-to-model differences in the mean changes are largest in summer and not substantially smaller than those from the third assessment report (TAR). Model uncertainties are in the same order or even larger than the uncertainty introduced by the different scenarios. Compared to TAR, the AR4 runs show a much more consistent tendency for increases in Central Europe summer temperature variability especially towards the end of the 21st century (for 2070-2099: ~22% to 47% increase). No clear changes in seasonal mean temperature variability are found for the other seasons and the averaged Northern Hemisphere land time series.",

Twenty years of monthly precipitation from each of the 22 models\u2019 20th century climate simulation, together with the available daily precipitation from 14 of them, are analyzed and compared with GPCP monthly and daily precipitation. We focus on the seasonal cycle and horizontal pattern of monsoon precipitation, together with the two dominant intraseasonal modes: the eastward-propagating Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the westward-propagating easterly waves.\n\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the North American monsoon and associated intraseasonal variability. Most of the models reproduce the monsoon rain belt extending from southeast to northwest. However, most models overestimate the precipitation over the core monsoon region throughout the seasonal cycle. Although many models reproduce the gradual northward shift of precipitation from March to July, several models simulate a nearly simultaneous increase of precipitation in northern and southern latitudes, leading to a too-early monsoon onset. Moreover, most models fail to reproduce the gradual southward shift of precipitation from August to November, and keep the high precipitation in monsoon region until the end of the year.\n\nRegarding the intraseasonal modes, most of the models produce overly weak variances for both the MJO and easterly waves, and simulate poor eastward propagation of the MJO. Nevertheless, most models simulate good westward propagation of easterly waves.\n",

Eight years of daily precipitation from each model\u2019s 20th century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite retrieved precipitation. We focus on the three major components of Asian summer monsoon: the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM), and the east Asian summer monsoon (EASM), together with the two dominant intraseasonal modes: the eastward and northward propagating boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSIO) and the westward propagating 12-24 day mode.\n\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs display a wide range of skill in simulating the intraseasonal variability associated with Asian summer monsoon. During boreal summer (May-October), most of the models produce reasonable seasonal mean precipitation over the ISM region, but excessive precipitation over WNPSM region and insufficient precipitation over EASM region. In other words, models concentrate their rain too close to the equator in the Western Pacific. Most of the models simulate overly weak total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance, as well as too little variance for BSIO and the 12-24 day mode. Moreover, models often have difficulty in simulating the eastward propagation of BSIO. Nevertheless, many models simulate well the northward propagation of BSIO, together with the westward propagation of the 12-24 day mode. The northward propagation in these models is thus not simply a NW-SE tilted tail protruding off of an eastward-moving deep-tropical intraseasonal oscillation. Only 4-5 models produce spectral peaks in the BSIO and 12-24 day frequency bands; instead, most of the models display too red a spectrum, i.e. an overly strong persistence of precipitation.\n",

The first group (8 models) shows an oscillation with a constant period shorter than the observed ENSO period, and sometimes with a constant amplitude. The second group (6 models) does not produce many statistically significant peaks in the ENSO frequency band, but usually produces one or two prominent peaks (episodes) at period longer than 6 years. The third group (8 models) displays significant interdecadal variability of ENSO in both amplitude and period.

            "abstract": "This study examines the double-ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone) problem in the coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) participating in the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  The 20th century climate simulations of 22 IPCC AR4 CGCMs are analyzed, together with the available AMIP runs from 12 of them. To understand the physical mechanisms for the double-ITCZ problem, the main ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, including the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient&#8722;trade wind feedback (or Bjerknes feedback), the SST&#8722;surface latent heat flux (LHF) feedback, and the SST&#8722;surface shortwave flux (SWF) feedback, are studied in detail. \n\nThe results show that most of the current state-of-the-art CGCMs have some degree of the double-ITCZ problem, which is characterized by excessive precipitation over much of the tropics (e.g. northern hemisphere ITCZ, South Pacific Convergence Zone, maritime continent, and equatorial Indian Ocean), and often associated with insufficient precipitation over equatorial Pacific. The excessive precipitation over much of the tropics usually causes overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF and insufficient SWF, leading to significant cold SST bias in much of the tropical oceans. Most of the models also simulate insufficient latitudinal asymmetry in precipitation and SST over eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nThe AMIP runs also produce excessive precipitation over much of the tropics including equatorial Pacific, which also leads to overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF and insufficient SWF. This suggests that the excessive tropical precipitation is an intrinsic error of the atmospheric models, and that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in the coupled runs of many models comes from ocean-atmosphere feedback. Feedback analysis demonstrates that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in different models is associated with one or more of the following three biases in ocean-atmosphere feedback over equatorial Pacific: (1) excessive Bjerknes feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of precipitation to SST and overly strong time-mean surface wind speed; (2) overly positive SST-LHF feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of surface air humidity to SST; and (3) insufficient SST-SWF feedback, which is caused by insufficient sensitivity of cloud amount to precipitation. Off the equator over the eastern Pacific stratus region, most of the models produce insufficient stratus-SST feedback associated with insufficient sensitivity of stratus cloud amount to SST, which may contribute to the insufficient latitudinal asymmetry of SST in their coupled runs. These results suggest that the double-ITCZ problem in CGCMs may be alleviated by reducing the excessive tropical precipitation and the above feedback-relevant errors in the atmospheric models.\n",

Simple scaling analysis supports the notion that the poleward extent of the Hadley cell is set by the location where the thermally driven jet first becomes baroclinically unstable. The expansion of the Hadley cell is caused by an increase in the subtropical static stability, which pushes poleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundary of the Hadley cell.",

Despite the large changes in the tropical Pacific mean state, the changes in ENSO amplitude are highly model dependant. In order to investigate why similar mean state changes lead to very different ENSO amplitude changes, we analyze the characteristics of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) variability simulated in two coupled general circulation models (CGCMs): the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) models. The skewed distribution of tropical Pacific SSTA simulated in the MRI model suggests the importance of non-linearities in the ENSO physics, whereas the GFDL model lies in the linear regime. Consistent with these differences in ENSO regime, the GFDL is insensitive to the mean state changes, whereas the MRI model is sensitive to the mean state changes associated with the 4xCO2 scenario. Similarly, the low frequency modulation of ENSO amplitude in the GFDL model is related to atmospheric stochastic forcing, but in the MRI model the amplitude modulation is insensitive to the noise forcing. These results suggest that the understanding of changes in ENSO statistics among various climate change projections is highly dependent on whether the model ENSO is in the linear or non-linear regime.",

The strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation decreases as the climate warms inall IPCC-AR4 models, in a manner consistent with the thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and Soden (2006). The weakening occurs preferentially in the zonally-asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley) component of the tropical circulation and is shown to induce substantial changes to the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the overall circulation weakens by decreasing the frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the frequency of weak updrafts; although the robustness of this behavior across all models cannot be confirmed due to lack of data. As the climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean resemble \u201cEl Nin&#771;o-like\u201d conditions; however, the mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El Nin&#771;o and are reproduced in both mixed-layer and full ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character of the Indian Ocean response to global warming resembles that of Indian Ocean Dipole Mode events. The consensus of model results presented here are also consistent with recently-detected changes in sea level pressure since the mid-19thCentury.",

This study focuses on vertical wind shear(Vs)over the tropical Atlantic during hurricane season, the increase of which has been historically associated with diminished hurricane activity and intensity. A suite of state-of-the-art global climate model experiments is used to project changes in Vs over the 21st century. Substantial (up to 30%)increases in tropical Atlantic and East Pacific shear are robust features of these experiments, and are shown to be connected to the model-projected decrease in the Pacific Walker circulation. The relative changes in shear are found to be comparable to those of other large-scale environmental parameters associated with Atlantic hurricane activity. The influence of these Vs changes should be incorporated into projections of long-term hurricane activity.",

The dry static stability within the midlatitudes exhibits a robust increase in the simulations, with upper tropospheric warming outpacing the lower troposphere by approximately 2 K.  The increase in stability is especially evident in the summer season, and is more prominent in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern.  The moist static stability is largely unchanged, on the other hand, showing that moist convection plays a dominant role in determining the temperature structure of the midlatitudes.  We compare bulk measures of the stability with changes in meridional gradients for each individual model simulation, and find that moist theories work well in predicting the stability with the primary exception of the Northern Hemisphere summer, where enhanced surface warming over land reduces the increase in stability.\n",

Averaged over all those model simulations, the current climate is reasonably well reproduced.  However, this averaging procedure hides the errors from individual models.  Over the 20th century, the multimodel average simulates a larger sea-ice concentration decrease around the Antarctic Peninsula compared to other regions, which is in qualitative agreement with observations.  This is likely related to the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index over the 20th century, in both observations and in the multimodel average.  Despite the simulated positive future trend in SAM, such a regional feature around the Antarctic Peninsula is absent in the projected sea-ice change for the end of the 21st century.  The maximum decrease is indeed located over the central Weddell Sea and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas.  In most models, changes in the oceanic currents could play a role in the regional distribution of the sea ice, especially in the Ross Sea, where stronger southward currents could also be responsible for a smaller sea-ice decrease during the 21st century.  Finally, changes in the mixed layer depth can be found in some models, inducing locally strong changes in the sea-ice concentration. ",

Because microwave radiation penetrates non-rainy and warm clouds, we are able to estimate the FTH over most of the dynamical regimes that characterize the tropics. The comparisons reveal that two models simulate a free troposphere drier than observed (< 10%), while the others agree with the observations. Despite some differences, the level of agreement is good enough to lend confidence in the representation of atmospheric\nmoistening processes.

            "abstract": "An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting global warming are typically associated with a weakening of the thermohaline circulation (THC) in model scenarios. For the models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), this weakening shows a significant (r=0.62) dependence on the initial THC strength: it is stronger for initially strong overturning. We propose a physical mechanism for this phenomenon based on an analysis of additional simulations with the coupled climate models CLIMBER-2 and CLIMBER-3\u000b. The mechanism is based on the fact that sea ice cover greatly reduces heat loss from the ocean. The extent of sea ice is strongly influenced by the near surface atmospheric temperature (SAT) in the North Atlantic but also by the strength of the THC itself which transports heat to the convection sites. Consequently, sea ice tends to extend further south for weaker THC. Initially larger sea-ice cover responds more strongly to atmospheric warming, thus sea ice retreats more strongly for an initially weaker THC. This sea ice retreat tends to strengthen, i.e. stabilize, the THC because the sea ice retreat allows more oceanic heat loss. This stabilizing effect is stronger for runs with weak initial THC and extensive sea ice cover. Therefore an initially weak THC weakens less under global warming. In contrast to pre-industrial climate, sea ice melting presently plays the role of an external forcing with respect to THC stability.",

Adequate observations to constrain the\nuncertainties in these clear-sky fluxes have long been missing. The present study provides\nnewly derived observational clear-sky climatologies at worldwide distributed anchor\nsites with high-accuracy measurements from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network\n(BSRN) and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). These data are\nused to systematically assess the performance of a total of 36 GCMs with respect to their\nsurface solar clear-sky fluxes. These models represent almost 2 decades of model\ndevelopment, from the atmospheric model intercomparison projects AMIP I and AMIP II\nto the state of the art models participating in the 4th Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4). Results show that earlier model\nversions tend to largely overestimate the surface insolation under cloud-free conditions.\nThis identifies an overly transparent cloud-free atmosphere as a key error source for the\nexcessive surface insolation in GCMs noted in previous studies. Possible origins are an\nunderestimated water vapor absorption and a lack of adequate aerosol forcing.\nSimilar biases remain in a number of current models with comparatively low atmospheric\nclear-sky solar absorption (around 60 Wm-2 in the global mean). However, there are\nnow several models participating in IPCC-AR4 with higher atmospheric clear-sky\nabsorption (70 Wm-2 and up, globally averaged) and more realistic aerosol treatment,\nwhich are in excellent agreement with the newly derived observational clear-sky\nclimatologies. This underlines the progress made in radiative transfer modeling as well as\nin the observation and diagnosis of solar radiation under cloudless atmospheres and puts\nthe most likely value of solar radiation absorbed in the cloud-free atmosphere slightly\nabove 70 Wm-2.",

            "abstract": "How much can we trust model-based projections of future anthropogenic climate change? This review attempts to give an overview of this important but difficult topic by using three main lines of evidence: the skill of models in simulating present-day climate, intermodel agreement on future climate changes, and the ability of models to simulate climate changes that have already occurred. A comparison of simulated and observed present-day climates shows good agreement for many basic variables, particularly at large horizontal scales, and a tendency for biases to vary in sign between different models, but there is a risk that these features might be partly a result of tuning. Overall, the connection between model skill in simulating present-day climate and the skill in simulating future climate changes is poorly known. An intercomparison of future climate changes between models shows a better agreement for changes in temperature than precipitation and sea level pressure, but some aspects of change in the latter two variables are also quite consistent between models. A comparison of simulations with observed climate changes is, in principle, a good test for the models, but there are several complications. Nonetheless, models have skilfully simulated many large-scale aspects of observed climate changes, including but not limited to the evolution of the global mean surface air temperature in the 20th century. Furthermore, although there is no detailed agreement between the simulated and observed geographical patterns of change, the grid box scale temperature, precipitation and pressure changes observed during the past half-century generally fall within the range of model results. Considering the difficulties associated with other sources of information, the variation of climate changes between different models is probably the most meaningful measure of uncertainty that is presently available. In general, however, this measure is more likely to underestimate than overestimate the actual uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "The authors of this study recently proposed a resampling method for deriving probabilistic forecasts of near-term climate change and presented some results focusing on temperature and precipitation changes in southern Finland from 1971-2000 to 2011-2020. Here, the sensitivity of the resulting forecasts to two details of the methodology is studied. First, to account for differences between simulated and observed climate variability, a variance correction technique is devised. Second, the sensitivity of the forecasts to the choice of the baseline period is studied. In southern Finland, the variance correction technique generally widens the derived probability distributions of precipitation change, mirroring an underestimate of the observed precipitation variability in climate models. However, the impact on the derived probability distributions of temperature change is small. The choice of the baseline period is generally more important, but again the forecasts of temperature change are less sensitive to different options than those of precipitation change. Cross-verification suggests that the variance correction leads to a slight improvement in the potential quality of the probabilistic forecasts, especially for precipitation change. The optimal baseline length appears to be at least 30 years, and the baseline should be as late as possible (e.g., 1971-2000 is preferable over 1961-1990).",

Results from this set of models agree very closely with the observations.\n The range of results expected given the uncertainties in the observations and the model forcings is wider than that observed, so the models are surprisingly good.\n\nAlthough the agreement over the century is good, there are notable differences between the observations and the collective response of the models in two places: the times of volcanic eruptions, and around 1940. The first suggests that the models may be too sensitive on short timescales, and the second may indicate a weakness in the observations.\n",

            "abstract": "Climate model simulations consistently show that in response to greenhouse gas forcing surface temperatures over land increase more rapidly than over sea. The enhanced warming over land is not simply a transient effect, since it is also present in equilibrium conditions. We examine 20 models from the IPCC AR4 database. The global land/sea warming ratio varies in the range 1.36\u20131.84, independent of global mean temperature change. In the presence of increasing radiative forcing, the warming ratio for a single model is fairly constant in time, implying that the land/sea temperature difference increases with time. The warming ratio varies with latitude, with a minimum in equatorial latitudes, and maxima in the subtropics. A simple explanation for these findings is provided, and comparisons are made with observations. For the low-latitude (40\u00b0S\u201340\u00b0N) mean, the models suggest a warming ratio of 1.51 \u00b1 0.13, while recent observations suggest a ratio of 1.54 \u00b1 0.09.",

As the community moves towards modeling the earth system, it is important to note that not all biases have equivalent impacts on biology. Bioclimatic classification systems provide means of filtering model errors so as to bring out those impacts that may be particularly important for the terrestrial biosphere. We examine one such diagnostic, the classic system of K\u00f6ppen, and show that it can provide an \u201cearly warning\u201d of which model biases are likely to produce serious biases in the land biosphere. Moreover, it provides a rough evaluation criterion for the performance of dynamic vegetation models.

            "abstract": "We survey the IPCC AR4 models' responses to SRES A1B forcing in order to evaluate a prediction of climate change common to all models and testable using GPS radio occultation data over the coming decades. Of the IPCC AR4 models that submitted runs of the SRES A1B forcing scenario, we select twelve because of the timeliness of their submission. Trends in the global average surface air temperature show better overall agreement over the first 50 years than in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, but the patterns of global surface air temperature trends show little improvement in intermodel agreement. These same twelve models show qualitatively better agreement in their patterns of upper air temperature trends. All show maintenance of a moist adiabatic temperature profile in the tropics, making tropospheric temperature trends the greatest at 200 hPa in the tropics. We test the climate models' predictions using optimal fingerprinting. In order to do so, we use long preindustrial control runs of four of the IPCC AR4 models. Simulating trends in the log of the vertically integrated microwave refractivity, or ``dry'' pressure, of the atmosphere is nearly the same as measuring trends in geopotential heights of constant pressure surfaces. The first four EOFs of interannual variability of log-dry pressure, as determined by two independent climate models, are ENSO, modes closely associated with the southern and northern annular modes, and a previously unidentified symmetric jet migration EOF. The latter is characterized by poleward migration of the eddy-driven midlatitude jet correlated between hemispheres. The ENSO mode and especially the symmetric jet migration EOF contribute most to optimal detection and are similarly predicted by the IPCC AR4 models. The common prediction of all climate models will be tested with 95% confidence with GPS radio occultation data in 7 to 13 years. The fingerprint is dominated by symmetric poleward migration of the eddy-driven midlatitude jets.",

            "abstract": "A modification to the traditional cloud radiative forcing (CRF) formula is presented.  This alternative approach uses incident--rather than absorbed--solar radiation to calculate shortwave cloud radiative forcing at the surface.  By removing the competing influence of surface albedo on CRF, the new formula more effectively isolates the impact of clouds and cloud changes under different climatic regimes. The removal of surface albedo effects makes the change in CRF a more useful measure of cloud feedback, although other factors (such as changes in clear-sky solar absorption) can still muddle the interpretation.  I present examples from GCM greenhouse simulations that demonstrate how this new formula can help to differentiate between actual cloud feedbacks versus apparent ones induced by snow and ice meltback using the traditional CRF equation.  The results suggest that changes in surface albedo contribute approximately 20 to 40% of the high-latitude CRF anomaly using the standard formula applied to an equilibrium 2 x CO2 simulation and about 50% to the greater Arctic when used on 21st-century transient greenhouse experiments.",

Over Southeast Asia, where the most extensive tropical peatlands in the world occur, 11 climate models for the IPCC Fourth Assessment show an overall decrease of rainfall in future dry seasons.  Over Amazonia, future rainfall changes in dry seasons are highly uncertain; five models predict increased rainfall, and the remaining models predict the opposite.  We have further examined the UKMO-HadCM3, GISS-ER, and GFDL-CM2.1 models. Over Southeast Asia, all three models predict similar decreases of rainfall and evaporative fraction, implying an increase of water table depth and surface dryness during the dry season south of the equator.  Such changes would potentially switch peat ecosystems from acting as C sinks to C sources.  Over Amazonia, the two models with the best simulations of current rainfall produce conflicting results for the future of peat stability.",

Although the models examined here are able to simulate the land precipitation amount well, most of them are unable to reproduce the spatial patterns of the precipitation frequency and intensity. For light precipitation (1\u201310 mm day&#8722;1), most models overestimate the frequency but produce patterns of the intensity that are in broad agreement with observations. In contrast, for heavy precipitation (>10 mm day&#8722;1), most models considerably underestimate the intensity but simulate the frequency relatively well. The average number of rainy days contributing to most of the annual precipitation is a simple index that captures the combined effects of precipitation frequency and intensity on the water supply.

For the emission scenarios SRES B1 (a low projection), A1B (a medium projection), and A2 (a high projection) during the 21st century, all the models consistently show a shift towards more intense and extreme precipitation for the globe as a whole and over various regions. For both SRES B1 and A2, most models show decreased daily precipitation frequency and all the models show increased daily precipitation intensity. The multi-model averaged percentage increase in the precipitation intensity (2.0% K-1) is larger than the magnitude of the precipitation frequency decrease (-0.7% K-1).  However, the shift in precipitation frequency distribution towards extremes results in large increases in very heavy precipitation events (>50 mm day-1), so that for very heavy precipitation, the percentage increase in frequency is much larger than the increase in intensity (31.2% vs. 2.4%). The climate model-projected increases in daily precipitation intensity are, however, smaller than that based on simple thermodynamics (~7% K-1). Multi-model ensemble means show that precipitation amount increases during the 21st century over high latitudes, as well as over currently wet regions in low- and mid-latitudes more than other regions. This increase mostly results from a combination of increased frequency and intensity. Over the dry regions in the subtropics, precipitation amount generally declines because of decreases in both frequency and intensity. This indicates that wet regions may get wetter and dry regions may become drier mostly because of simultaneous increase (decrease) of precipitation frequency and intensity.",

For all energy budget components in the twentieth-century simulations (the 20C3M simulation), the across-model variance and the differences from observational estimates are largest in the marginal ice zone (Barents, Kara, Chukchi Seas). Both downward and upward longwave radiation at the surface are underestimated in winter by many models, and the ensenmble mean annual net surface energy loss by longwave radiation is 35 W/m2, which is less than for the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses but in line with some of the satellite estimates. \nIncoming solar radiation is overestimated by the models in spring and underestimated in summer and autumn. \nThe ensemble mean annual net surface energy gain by shortwave radiation is 39 W/m2, which is slightly less than for the observational based estimates, In the twentyfirst-century simulations driven by the SRES A2 scenario, increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase (average for 2080\u20132100 minus average for 1980\u20132000 averages) the annual average ensemble mean downward longwave radiation by 30.1 W/m2. This was partly counteracted by a 10.7 W/m2 reduction in downward shortwave radiation. \nEnhanced sea ice melt and increased surface temperatures increase the annual surface upward longwave radiation by 27.1 W/m2 and reduce the upward shortwave radiation by 13.2 W/m2, giving an annual net (shortwave plus longwave) surface radiation increase of 5.8 W/m2 , with the maximum changes in summer. \nThe increase in net surface radiation is largely offset by an increased energy loss of 4.4 W/m2 by the turbulent fluxes.",

Our experiments also support recent\nhigh-resolution ocean model experiments\nsuggesting that enhanced mesoscale eddy activity associated with poleward\nintensified winds influences subsurface warming. In particular, we\nfind that increased poleward heat transport associated with increased mesoscale\neddy activity enhances the warming south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\nFinally, we report on a mechanism involving offshore Ekman sea ice transport\n(modulated by enhanced mesoscale activity) which acts to significantly limit the\nhuman-induced high-latitude Southern Hemisphere surface temperature response.",

            "abstract": "Since the upper ocean takes up much of the heat added to the earth system by anthropogenic global warming, one would expect that global warming would lead to an increase in stratification and a decrease in the ventilation of the ocean interior. However, multiple simulations in global coupled climate models using an ideal age tracer which is set to zero in the mixed layer and ages at 1 yr/yr outside this layer show that the intermediate depths in the low latitudes, Northwest Atlantic, and parts of the Arctic Ocean become younger under global warming. This paper reconciles these apparently contradictory trends, showing that the decreases result from changes in the relative contributions of old deep waters and younger surface waters. Implications for the tropical oxygen minimum zones, which play a critical role in global biogeochemical cycling are considered in detail.",

            "title": "The effect of internal variability on anthropogenic climate projections",
            "abstract": "A single model ensemble of five members, with a CO2 increase of 1% per year, has been used to investigate the spread in climate change estimates. It is furthermore explored how this spread is related to internal variability of the climate system and the strength of the CO2 forcing. As expected, the fraction of the globe where a statistically significant climate change could be detected increased with the strength of the CO2 forcing. For temperature this fraction increased rapidly with integration time, while the increase of areas with statistically significant precipitation change was much slower. It is shown that increasing the averaging periods for estimating climate change from 20 to 40 yr reduced the spread due to internal variability by 40% in the Arctic regions. This is due to better sampling of decadal internal variability. In order to reduce sampling uncertainty below a fixed threshold, the number of ensemble members needed is much larger in the polar region than in the lower latitudes. This should be taken into account when designing modelling strategies (high-resolution modelling versus larger number of ensemble members) to reduce uncertainty in future polar climate change. At the time of doubling of CO2, the variance of the climate change estimates, based on 20 yr averages from a single model ensemble, constitutes 13% and 42% of corresponding multimodel ensemble variances for temperature and precipitation, respectively. In the case of precipitation, this indicates that some caution should be used in attributing different climate change estimates to differences in model formulations.",

            "abstract": "Several impacts of climate change may depend more on changes in mean daily minimum (Tmin) or maximum (Tmax) temperatures than daily averages. To evaluate uncertainties in these variables, we compared projections of Tmin and Tmax changes by 2046-2065 for 12 climate models under an A2 emission scenario. Average modeled changes in Tmin were similar to those for Tmax, with slightly greater increases in Tmin consistent with historical trends exhibiting a reduction in diurnal temperature ranges. In contrast, the inter-model variability of Tmin and Tmax projections exhibited substantial differences. For example, inter-model standard deviations of June-August Tmax changes were more than 50% greater than for Tmin throughout much of North America, Europe, and Asia. Model differences in cloud changes, which exert relatively greater influence on Tmax during summer and Tmin during winter, were identified as the main source of uncertainty disparities. These results highlight the importance of considering separately projections for Tmax and Tmin when assessing climate change impacts, even in cases where average projected changes are similar. In addition, impacts that are most sensitive to summertime Tmin or wintertime Tmax may be more predictable than suggested by analyses using only projections of daily average temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Most research on the agricultural impacts of climate change has focused on the major annual crops, yet perennial cropping systems are less adaptable and thus potentially more susceptible to damage. In regions where perennial crops are economically and culturally important, improved assessments of yield responses to future climate are needed to prioritize adaptation strategies. These impact assessments, in turn, must rely on climate and crop models that contain often poorly defined uncertainties. We evaluated the impact of climate change on six major perennial crops in California: wine grapes, almonds, table grapes, oranges, walnuts, and avocados. Outputs from multiple climate models were used to evaluate climate uncertainty, while multiple statistical crop models, derived by resampling historical databases, were used to address crop response uncertainties. We find that, despite these uncertainties, climate change in California is very likely to put downward pressure on yields of almonds, walnuts, avocados, and table grapes by 2050. Without CO2 fertilization or adaptation measures, projected losses range from 0 to >40% depending on the crop and the trajectory of climate change. Climate change uncertainty generally had a larger impact on projections than crop model uncertainty, although the latter was substantial for several crops. Opportunities for expansion into cooler regions were identified, but this adaptation would require substantial investments and may be limited by non-climatic constraints. Given the long time scales for growth and production of orchards and vineyards (~30 years), climate change should be an important factor in selecting perennial varieties and deciding whether and where perennials should be planted.",

            "abstract": "In this study, energy spectrum of blocking in the Northern Hemisphere is examined in the framework of the 3D normal mode decomposition using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for 51 years. Attention is concentrated to the barotropic component of the atmosphere, where the low-frequency variabilities dominate. The horizontal scale of disturbances is measured by the phase speed of a Rossby mode c instead of the horizontal wavenumber.\nAccording to the result of the energetics analysis in the phase speed domain, we find an accumulation of energy at the spherical Rhines speed cR when a blocking occurs. The energy level at cR exceeds the saturation spectrum E, denoted by E = ac2, which is derived theoretically from the criterion of Rossby wave breaking &#948;q/&#948;y <: 0, where a represents a constant proportional to mass of the atmosphere for the unit area, and q is the barotropic potential vorticity. The amplified Rossby wave persists longer at the same geographical location because the Rossby wave is stationary for the scale of cR. The wave cannot break down easily at the wave regime near cR.\nThe result suggests that an atmospheric blocking occurs when the energy level at cR exceeds the Rossby wave saturation spectrum of E = ac2. The blocking structure is characterized by &#948;q/&#948;y < 0, which represents the saturation criterion of Rossby waves to derive the spectrum of E = ac2.",

            "abstract": "In this study, energy spectrum and energy flow of the large-scale atmospheric motions are examined in reference to the Arctic Oscillation index. Attention is concentrated to the barotropic component of the atmosphere in the framework of the 3D normal mode decomposition.\nAccording to the result of the observational analysis in the phase speed domain, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is characterized as the energy increase at the meridional index l=3 with simultaneous decrease at l=5 of the zonal field. The result is consistent with the theory of the AO by the singular eigenmode of the global atmosphere. The accumulation of energy at the eigenmode of the AO is explained by the enhanced energy flux FZi associated with the zonal-wave interaction.\nIt is found in this study that the energy flux FZi comes from eddies at the spherical Rhines speed cR where the planetary-scale Rossby wave becomes stationary. The result suggests that the low-frequency variability associated with the AO is maintained by energy flux from cR, which is compensated by the up-scale energy cascade from synoptic eddies in addition to the forced stationary planetary waves by topography.",

            "abstract": "Winter cyclone activity over the Northern Hemisphere is investigated in an ECHAM4/OPYC3 greenhouse gas scenario simulation. The goal of this investigation is to identify changes in cyclone activity associated with increasing concentrations. To this aim, two 50-year time periods are analysed, one representing present day climate conditions and the other a perturbed climate when CO2 concentrations exceed twice the present concentrations. Cyclone activity is assessed using an automatic algorithm, which identifies and tracks cyclones based on sea level pressure fields. The algorithm detects not only large and long living cyclones over the main ocean basins, but also their smaller counterparts in secondary storm track regions like the Mediterranean Basin. For the present climate, results show a good agreement with NCEP-reanalysis, provided that the spectral and time resolutions of the reanalysis are reduced to those available for the model. \n\nSeveral prominent changes in cyclone activity are observed for the scenario period in comparison to the present day climate, especially over the main ocean basins. A significant decrease of overall cyclone track density is found between 35 and 55 degrees North, together with a small increase polewards. These changes result from two different signals for deep and medium cyclones: for deep cyclones (core pressure below 990 hPa) there is a poleward shift in the greenhouse gas scenario, while for medium cyclones (core pressure between 990 and 1010 hPa) a general decrease in cyclone counts is found. The same kind of changes (a shift for intense cyclones and an overall decrease for the weaker ones) are detected when distinguishing cyclones from their intensity, quantified in terms of Laplacian of pressure. Thus, the simulated changes can not solely be attributed to alterations in mean sea level pressure. Instead, corresponding increases in upper-tropospheric baroclinicity suggest more favourable conditions for the development of stronger systems at higher latitudes, especially at the delta regions of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific storm tracks.\n\n",

            "abstract": "Synoptic activity over the Northern Hemisphere is evaluated in ensembles of ECHAM5/MPI-OM1 simulations for recent climate conditions (20C) and for three climate scenarios (following SRES A1B, A2, B1). A close agreement is found between the simulations for present day climate and the respective results from reanalysis. Significant changes in the winter mid-tropospheric storm tracks are detected in all three scenario simulations. Ensemble mean climate signals are rather similar, with particularly large activity increases downstream of the Atlantic storm track over Western Europe. The magnitude of this signal is largely dependent on the imposed change in forcing. However, differences between individual ensemble members may be large. With respect to the surface cyclones, the scenario runs produce a reduction in cyclonic track density over the mid-latitudes, even in the areas with increasing mid-tropospheric activity. The largest decrease in track densities occurs at subtropical latitudes, e.g., over the Mediterranean Basin. An increase of cyclone intensities is detected for limited areas (e.g., near Great Britain and Aleutian Isles) for the A1B and A2 experiments. The changes in synoptic activity are associated with alterations of the Northern Hemisphere circulation and background conditions (blocking frequencies, jet stream). The North Atlantic Oscillation index also shows increased values with enhanced forcing. With respect to the effects of changing synoptic activity, the regional change in cyclone intensities is accompanied by alterations of the extreme surface winds, with increasing values over Great Britain, North and Baltic Seas, as well as the areas with vanishing sea ice, and decreases over much of the subtropics.

            "abstract": "A simple storm loss model is applied to an ensemble of ECHAM5/MPI-OM1 GCM simulations in order to estimate changes of insured loss potentials over Europe in the 21st century. Losses are computed based on the daily maximum wind speed for each grid point. The calibration of the loss model is performed using wind data from the ERA40-Reanalysis and German loss data. The obtained annual losses for the present climate conditions (20C, three realisations) reproduce the statistical features of the historical insurance loss data for Germany.\nThe climate change experiments correspond to the SRES Scenarios\nA1B and A2, and for each of them three realisations are considered. On average, insured loss potentials increase for all analysed European regions at the end of the 21st century. Changes are largest for Germany and France, and lowest for Portugal/Spain. Additionally, the spread between the single realisations is large, ranging e.g. for Germany from +4% to +43% in terms of mean annual loss.\nMoreover, almost all simulations show an increasing interannual variability of storm damage. This assessment is even more pronounced if no adaptation of building structure to climate change is considered. The increased loss potentials are linked with enhanced values for the high percentiles of surface wind maxima over Western and Central Europe, which in turn are associated with an enhanced number and increased intensity of extreme cyclones over the British Isles and the North Sea.",

Although significant trends in North Atlantic / European storm activity have not been identified for the last few decades, 25 recent studies provide evidence that under anthropogenic climate change the number of extreme storms could increase, whereas the total number of cyclones may be slightly reduced. In this study, loss potentials derived from an ensemble of climate models using a simple storm damage model under climate change conditions are shown. For United Kingdom and Germany ensemble-mean storm-related losses are found to increase by up 30 to 37%. Furthermore, the interannual variability of extreme events will increase leading to a higher risk of extreme storm activity and related losses.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the response of the terrestrial biosphere to changes in climate using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Land Model's Dynamic Vegetation Model (CLM-DGVM) driven with future climate projections from eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) participating in the fourth assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The simulated potential vegetation under the pre-industrial control (PICNTRL) climate (CO2 concentration held at 275ppm) is compared with that under the SRESA1B after-stabilization climate (CO2 concentration stabilizes at 720ppm beyond 2100). Simulated vegetation changes include increases or decreases of the fractional coverage of different plant functional types and the rather dramatic changes of the dominant plant functional types. Although such changes differ significantly across the different GCM climate projections,  a quite consistent pattern emerges, characterized by a considerable pole-ward spread or shift of temperate and boreal forests in the northern hemisphere high latitudes, and a substantial degradation of vegetation cover in the tropics especially in portions of West and southern Africa and South America. Despite the widespread vegetation degradation in the tropics, net primary productivity (NPP) is predicted to increase under most GCM scenarios over most of the globe. Carbon fluxes to the atmosphere due to fire generally increase too across the globe. Such responses of NPP and fire occurrence result from the synergistic effects of CO2 concentration changes, climate changes, and vegetation changes. A companion paper (in preparation) will examine how the biosphere response documented here influences the impact of climate change on surface hydrological conditions.  ",

The resulting signal resembles the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and is presumably associated with intrinsic dynamics of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). While certain phases of the oscillation are dominated by the anomalies in the North Atlantic region, other phases are characterized by global teleconnections to the North Pacific Ocean, Tropical Atlantic Ocean, as well as to the Southern Ocean. In particular, natural variability of sea-surface temperature in the Atlantic hurricanes\u2019 main development region has a peak-to-peak amplitude comparable in magnitude to this region\u2019s surface temperature increase over the past century, for all seasons. Evidence suggests that the AMO influence on secular trends in the global-mean surface temperature can arise via direct, regional, contribution to the surface temperature evolution, as well as via indirect route linked to variability of the oceanic uptake of CO2 associated with AMO-related THC changes.",

            "abstract": "Daily output from fifteen global climate system models and two global reanalyses were analyzed to create a synoptic climatology of Arctic sea level pressure and to assess predicted changes in net precipitation over the Arctic. The method of self-organizing maps was used to create the synoptic climatology from three decades of model output; 1991-2000, 2046-2055, and 2091-2100. The model derived synoptic climatology was compared to that from the two reanalyses, for the period 1991-2000, and this comparison was used to select a subset of models which best reproduced the currently observed synoptic climate of the Arctic. Of the fifteen models evaluated in this way only 4 models were able to reproduce the key features of the Arctic synoptic climate as depicted by the two global reanalyses. The synoptic climatology created using the self-organizing map technique lends itself to the study of extreme events and the projections from this subset of 4 models indicate an increase in cyclonically dominated weather patterns over the 21st century. The models also projected an increase in net precipitation over the Arctic cap and the large Arctic river watersheds during the 21st century. Using the synoptic climatology, a method to assess thermodynamic and circulation related changes in net precipitation was derived. The results of this assessment indicate that thermodynamic changes are responsible for more than 75% of the predicted change in Arctic net precipitation during the 21st century. ",

            "title": "The Arctic surface energy budget as simulated with the IPCC AR4 AOGCMs",
            "abstract": "Ensembles of simulations of the twentieth- and twentyfirst-century climate, performed with 20 coupled models for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment, provide the basis for an evaluation of the Arctic (70\u00b0&#8211;90\u00b0N) surface energy budget. While the various observational sources used for validation contain differences among themselves, some model biases and across-model differences emerge. For all energy budget components in the twentieth-century simulations (the 20C3M simulation), the across-model variance and the differences from observational estimates are largest in the marginal ice zone (Barents, Kara, Chukchi Seas). Both downward and upward longwave radiation at the surface are underestimated in winter by many models, and the ensenmble mean annual net surface energy loss by longwave radiation is 35 W/m2, which is less than for the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses but in line with some of the satellite estimates. Incoming solar radiation is overestimated by the models in spring and underestimated in summer and autumn. The ensemble mean annual net surface energy gain by shortwave radiation is 39 W/m2, which is slightly less than for the observational based estimates, In the twentyfirst-century simulations driven by the SRES A2 scenario, increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase (average for 2080&#8211;2100 minus average for 1980&#8211;2000 averages) the annual average ensemble mean downward longwave radiation by 30.1 W/m2. This was partly counteracted by a 10.7 W/m2 reduction in downward shortwave radiation. Enhanced sea ice melt and increased surface temperatures increase the annual surface upward longwave radiation by 27.1 W/m2 and reduce the upward shortwave radiation by 13.2 W/m2, giving an annual net (shortwave plus longwave) surface radiation increase of 5.8 W/m2 , with the maximum changes in summer. The increase in net surface radiation is largely offset by an increased energy loss of 4.4 W/m2 by the turbulent fluxes.",

            "title": "Intrinsic versus forced variation in coupled climate model simulations over the Arctic during the 20th Century.",
            "abstract": "There were two major multi-year, Arctic-wide (60-90&#61616;N) warm anomalies (> 0.7&#61616;C) in land surface air temperature (LSAT) during the 20th century, between 1920-1950 and again at the end of the century after 1979. Reproducing this decadal and longer variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, with considerable variability in amplitude among models. In contrast only eight models generated warm anomaly amplitude at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization, but not its timing. The durations of the mid-century warm events in all the models are decadal, while that of the observed was interdecadal. The variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations.  The random timing of mid-century warm anomalies in 20C3M simulations and the similar variance of the control runs in about half of the models suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability. Five models were considered to compare somewhat favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance of the observed temperature record in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly amplitude in their 20C3M simulations. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data.",

The former are characterized by the earliest warming, while the latter demonstrate latest or not achieved stable changes of the temperature.

The storm series in early 1990 and late 1999 led to enormous economic damages and insured claims. Although significant trends in North Atlantic/European storm activity have not been identified for the last few decades, recent studies provide evidence that under anthropogenic climate change the number of extreme storms could increase, whereas the total number of cyclones may be slightly reduced. In this study, loss potentials derived from an ensemble of climate models using a simple storm damage model under climate change conditions are shown. For the United Kingdom and Germany ensemble-mean storm-related losses are found to increase by up to 37%. Furthermore, the interannual variability of extreme events will increase leading to a higher risk of extreme storm activity and related losses.",

Nearly two dozen coupled ocean-atmosphere models have contributed output for a variety of climate scenarios. One scenario, the climate of the 20th century experiment (20C3M), produces model output that can be compared to the long record of sea level provided by altimetry. Generally, the output from the 20C3M runs is used to initialize simulations of future climate scenarios. Hence, validation of the 20C3M experiment results is crucial to the goals of the IPCC. We present comparisons of global mean sea level (GMSL), global mean steric sea level change, and regional patterns of sea level change from these models to results from altimetry, tide gauge measurements, and reconstructions.",

Precipitation averaged over monthly, seasonal and annual time periods is considered. The three regions encompass western, central and eastern North America excluding Alaska, northern Canada and Latin America. Most models compare well with observed precipitation for the central and eastern regions at all time scales. For the western region, all models over-predict precipitation at most time scales.

Major discrepancies on the spatial distribution of these precipitation changes remain in the latest generation models analyzed here. Despite this, we find a number of measures, both global and local, on which reasonable agreement is obtained, notably for the regions of drying trend (negative precipitation anomalies). Models agree on the overall amplitude of the precipitation decreases that occur at the margins of the convective zones, with percent error bars of magnitude similar to those for the tropical warming. Similar agreement is found on a precipitation climate sensitivity defined here, and on differential moisture increase inside and outside convection zones, a step in a hypothesized causal path leading to precipitation changes. A measure of local inter-model agreement on significant trends indicates consistent predictions for particular regions. Observed rainfall trends in several data sets show a significant summer drying trend in a main region of inter-model agreement: the Caribbean/Central-American region.",

These runs are examined for evidence of accelerated climate change associated with the removal of sea ice, particularly due to increasing surface albedo feedback. Both models become seasonally ice-free at an annual mean polar temperature of -9\u00b0C without registering much impact on the surface albedo feedback or disturbing the linear relationship between Arctic Ocean climate change and that of the surrounding region. When the polar temperature rises above -5\u00b0C, however, there is a sharp increase in the surface albedo feedback of one of the models, driving an abrupt elimination of Arctic ice and an increase in temperature above that expected from warming of the surrounding region. The transition to ice-free conditions is more linear in the other model, with ocean heat flux playing the primary driving role.",

            "abstract": "Key risks associated with projected climate trends for the 21st-century include the prospects of future climate states with no current analog and the disappearance of some extant climates. Because climate is a primary control on species distributions and ecosystem processes, novel 21st-century climates may promote formation of novel species associations and other ecological surprises, whereas the disappearance of some extant climates increases risk of extinction for species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities. Here we analyze multi-model ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience 1) high magnitudes of local climate change, 2) development of novel 21st-century climates, and/or 3) disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical montane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39% and 10-48% of the earth\u2019s terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20% and 4-20%. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates. There is a close correspondence between regions with globally disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots; for these regions, standard conservation solutions (e.g. assisted migration, networked reserves) may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity.",

The well-documented no-analog plant communities in late-glacial North America are closely linked to \u2018novel\u2019 climates also lacking modern analogs, characterized by high temperature seasonality.  In climate simulations for the IPCC A2 and B1 emission scenarios, novel climates arise by 2100AD, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.  These future novel climates are warmer than any present climates globally, with spatially variable shifts in precipitation.  These novel climates increase the risk of species reshuffling into future no-analog communities and other ecological surprises.  Most ecological models are at least partially parameterized from modern observations and so may fail to accurately predict ecological responses to these novel climates.  There is an urgent need to test the robustness of ecological models to climate conditions outside the modern experience.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies report that intensified precipitation resulting from anthropogenic climate change will stress civil infrastructures. Communities may have a window of opportunity to prepare, but information to support adaptation programs is sparse. For a small city\u2019s watershed, the present culvert system\u2019s capacity for conveying expected peak flow, Qp, resulting from climate change and full build-out was assessed. Least squares regression was used to transfer, to the study site, expected increases to point process location, scale, and regionalized shape parameters for 6 grid points from the GFDL CM-2.1 GCM. Runoff rates and Qp were modeled by the NRCS TR-55 curve number method and HEC-22. Standard civil engineering methods were used to reverse-engineer existing culverts, and replacement costs were estimated using national construction cost estimators. The mid-21st century 25-year precipitation is estimated to be 19% greater than the historical 25-year precipitation. This rate is similar to the 15% rule of thumb proposed by previous research. 43% of culverts likely will be undersized as a result of climate change and population growth, placing people and property at risk. A long-term upgrade program, utilizing existing strategies to manage uncertainty and costs, may maintain historically acceptable risk levels. The scientific, professional, and political communities remain concerned about the significant uncertainy that has not been eliminated from either GCM output or downscaling. However, numerous developments including scientific advancements, uncertainty management techniques, and increasing manifestation of climate change impacts, obviates the prudence of a \"wait-and-see\" strategy. This study proposes that current GCM output and statistical methods can generate reliable and specific estimates of impacts from climate change, in support of programs to adapt civil infrastructures.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the sensitivity of probabilistic predictions of the twenty-first century surface air temperature (SAT) changes to different multi-model averaging methods using available simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report. A way of observationally constrained prediction is provided by training multi-model simulations for the second half of the twentieth century with respect to long-term components. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) produces weighted probability density functions (PDFs) and we compare two methods of estimating weighting factors: Bayes factor and expectation\u2013maximization algorithm. It is shown that Bayesian-weighted PDFs for the global mean SAT changes are characterized by multi-modal structures from the middle of the twenty-first century onward, which are not clearly seen in arithmetic ensemble mean (AEM). This occurs because BMA tends to select a few high-skilled models and down-weight the others. Additionally, Bayesian results exhibit larger means and broader PDFs in the global mean predictions than the unweighted AEM. Multi-modality is more pronounced in the continental analysis using 30-year mean (2070\u20132099) SATs while there is only a little effect of Bayesian weighting on the 5\u201395% range. These results indicate that this approach to observationally constrained probabilistic predictions can be highly sensitive to the method of training, particularly for the later half of the twenty-first century, and that a more comprehensive approach combining different regions and/or variables is required.\n\nKeywords: global climate change; Bayesian model averaging; probabilistic prediction; surface air temperature",

We use climate models to study the possible causes of SST changes in Atlantic and Pacific tropical cyclogenesis regions. The observed SST increases in these regions range from 0.32 to 0.67C over the 20th century. The 22 climate models examined here suggest that\ncentury-timescale SST changes of this magnitude cannot be explained solely by unforced variability of the climate system. We employ model simulations of natural internal variability to make probabilistic estimates of the contribution of external forcing to observed SST changes. For the period 1906-2005, we find an 84% chance that external forcing explains at least 67% of observed SST increases in the two tropical cyclogenesis regions. Model \"20th century\" simulations, with external forcing by combined anthropogenic and natural factors, are generally capable of replicating observed SST increases. In experiments where forcing factors are varied individually rather than jointly,\nhuman-caused changes in greenhouse gases are the main driver of the 20th century SST increases in both tropical cyclogenesis regions.",

In both scenarios, the results indicate reduction of tropical forest cover areas which would be replaced by savannas. This reduction of tropical forests increases with the time through the end of the 21st century, mostly over southeastern Amazonia. Considering the biome changes from current potential vegetation in the case when at least 75% of the calculations agree on the projected biome change (consensus), the decrease of the tropical forest area in South America is 3% for the period 2020\u20132029, 9% for 2050\u20132059 and 18% for 2090\u20132099 for the A2 emission scenario.",

            "abstract": "In this paper the extensive integrations produced for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) are used to examine the relationship between ENSO and monsoons at interannual and decadal time scales. The study begins with an analysis of the monsoon simulation in the twentieth-century integrations. Six of the 18 models were found to have a reasonably realistic representation of monsoon precipitation climatology. For each of these six models SST and anomalous precipitation evolution along the equatorial Pacific during El Ni\u00f1o events display considerable differences when compared to observations. Out of these six models only four [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model versions 2.0 and 2.1 (GFDL_CM_2.0 and GFDL_CM_2.1), Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) model, and Max Planck Institute ECHAM5 (MPI_ECHAM5)] exhibit a robust ENSO\u2013monsoon contemporaneous teleconnection, including the known inverse relationship between ENSO and rainfall variations over India. Lagged correlations between the all-India rainfall (AIR) index and Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST reveal that three models represent the timing of the teleconnection, including the spring predictability barrier, which is manifested as the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three models (GFDL_CM_2.1) captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2\u20133 months after the summer monsoon, which is partially attributable to the intensity of the simulated El Ni\u00f1o itself. The authors find that the models that best capture the ENSO\u2013monsoon teleconnection are those that correctly simulate the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific and the associated changes to the equatorial Walker circulation during El Ni\u00f1o events.\n\nThe strength of the AIR-Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST correlation in the model runs waxes and wanes to some degree on decadal time scales. The overall magnitude and time scale for this decadal modulation in most of the models is similar to that seen in observations. However, there is little consistency in the phase among the realizations, suggesting a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon\u2013ENSO relationship.\n\nThe analysis was repeated for each of the four models using results from integrations in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration was raised to twice preindustrial values. From these \u201cbest\u201d models in the double CO2 simulations there are increases in both the mean monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent (by 5%\u201325%) and in its interannual variability (5%\u201310%). For each model the ENSO\u2013monsoon correlation in the global warming runs is very similar to that in the twentieth-century runs, suggesting that the ENSO\u2013monsoon connection will not weaken as global climate warms. This result, though plausible, needs to be taken with some caution because of the diversity in the simulation of ENSO variability in the coupled models that have been analyzed. Implications of the present results for monsoon prediction are discussed.\n\n",

            "abstract": "Observations show both a pronounced increase in ocean heat content (OHC) over the second half of the 20th century and substantial OHC variability on interannual-to-decadal time scales. Although climate models are able to simulate overall changes in OHC, they are generally thought to underestimate the amplitude of OHC variability. Using simulations of 20th century climate performed with 13 numerical models, we demonstrate that the apparent discrepancy between modeled and observed variability is largely explained by accounting for changes in observational coverage and instrumentation and by including the effects of volcanic eruptions. Our work does not support the recent claim that the 0- to 700-m layer of the global ocean experienced a substantial OHC decrease over the 2003 to 2005 time period. We show that the 2003-2005 cooling is largely an artifact of a systematic change in the observing system, with the deployment of Argo floats reducing a warm bias in the original observing system.",

            "abstract": "We show that the ratio of observed annual-mean land temperature change to ocean surface temperature change, f, has remained almost constant during 1955\u20132003. This is the case, despite most of the heat capacity of the climate system lying in the oceans, and rapid variations in climate forcing. Examining seven General Circulation Models (GCMs), we find land and ocean temperature behavior comparable to observations in six cases. For three models that reproduce observed f and for which we have data, we find no significant changes in future f under the SRES A1B scenario. We suggest that variations in land-ocean heat flux primarily balanced by ocean heat uptake are sufficient to maintain constant f. This flux is present in the six GCMs that resemble observations, suggesting that observed f may remain constant into the future, even if radiative forcing is markedly different than in the past.",

            "abstract": "  Changes in tropical cyclone activity are among the more potentially consequential results of global climate change, and it is therefore of considerable interest to understand how anthropogenic climate change may affect such storms. Global climate models are currently used to estimate future climate change, but the current generation of models lacks the horizontal resolution necessary to resolve the intense inner core of tropical cyclones. Here we review a new technique for inferring  tropical cyclone climatology from the output of global models, extend it to predict genesis climatologies (rather than relying on historical climatology), and apply it to current and future climate states simulated by a suite of global models developed in support of the most recent IPCC report.  This new technique solves the horizontal resolution problem by using a specialized, coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane model phrased in angular momentum coordinates, which provide high resolution of the core at low cost. This model is run along each of two thousand storm tracks generated using an advection-and-beta model, which is in turn driven by large-scale winds derived from the global models. In an extension to this method, tracks are initiated by randomly seeding large areas of the tropics with weak vortices and then allowing the intensity model to determine their survival, based on large-scale environmental conditions. We show that this method is largely successful in reproducing the observed spatial distribution,  seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of tropical cyclones in the present climate. When applied to simulations of global climate with double the present concentration of carbon dioxide, this method predicts substantial changes and geographic shifts in tropical cyclone activity, but with much variation among the global climate models used.  Changes in basin-wide power dissipation vary greatly from model to model and from basin to basin, but in general, storm frequency decreases and the frequency of landfall events declines nearly everywhere.  We demonstrate that in these simulations, the decrease in tropical cyclone activity is caused by the increasing difference between the moist entropy of the boundary layer and that of the middle troposphere as the climate warms. \n",

            "abstract": " Abstract: The Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) has a dipolelike pattern with a cold bias in the northern Tropics and a warm bias in the southeastern Tropics, which is reminiscent of the observed pattern of climate variability in boreal spring. Along the equator, in contrast, in boreal spring CCSM3 exhibits striking westerly winds with easterly winds in the upper troposphere, in turn reminiscent of the observed pattern of climate variability in boreal summer. The westerly winds cause a deepening of the eastern thermocline that keeps the east warm despite enhanced coastal upwelling. Thus, the bias in the seasonal cycle of the coupled model appears to project at least partially onto the spatial patterns of natural climate variability in this sector.\n\nInformation about the origin of the bias in CCSM3 is deduced from a comparison of CCSM3 with a simulation using specified historical SST to force the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3). The patterns of bias in CAM3 resemble those apparent in CCSM3, including the appearance of substantially intensified subtropical bands of sea level pressure (SLP), indicating that the problem may be traced to difficulties in the atmospheric component model. Positive SLP bias also appears in the western tropical region, which may be related to deficient Amazonian precipitation. The positive SLP bias seems to be the cause of the anomalous westerly trade winds in boreal spring, and those in turn appear to be responsible for the anomalous deepening of the thermocline in the southeastern Tropics.\n",

            "abstract": "The ability of coupled GCMs to correctly simulate the climatology and a prominent mode of variability of the West African monsoon is evaluated, and the results are used to make informed decisions about which models may be producing more reliable projections of future climate in this region. The integrations were made available by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison for the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The evaluation emphasizes the circulation characteristics that support the precipitation climatology, and the physical processes of a \u201crainfall dipole\u201d variability mode that is often associated with dry conditions in the Sahel when SSTs in the Gulf of Guinea are anomalously warm.\nBased on the quality of their 20th century simulations over West Africa in summer, three GCMs are chosen for analysis of the 21st century integrations under various assumptions about future greenhouse gas increases. Each of these models behaves differently in the 21st century simulations. One model simulates severe drying across the Sahel in the later part of the 21st century, while another projects quite wet conditions throughout the 21st century. In the third model, warming in the Gulf of Guinea leads to more modest drying in the Sahel due to a doubling of the number of anomalously dry years by the end of the century. An evaluation of the physical processes that cause these climate changes, in the context of our understanding about how the system works in the 20th century, suggests that the third model is providing the most reasonable projection of 21st century climate.",

            "title": "Interannual to Decadal Predictability of Tropical and North Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures",
            "abstract": "A multivariate empirical model is used to show that predictability of the dominant patterns of tropical and North Pacific oceanic variability, El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), is mostly limited to little more than a year, despite the presence of spectral peaks on decadal time scales. The model used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation statistics of July\u2013June-averaged SST from the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset for the years 1900\u20132002. The model accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data, including interannual and interdecadal spectral peaks that are significant relative to univariate red noise. Eigenanalysis of the linear dynamical operator yields propagating eigenmodes that correspond to these peaks but have very short decay times and, thus, limited predictability.\n\nLonger-term predictability does exist, however, due to two stationary eigenmodes that are more weakly damped. These eigenmodes do not strongly correspond to the canonical ENSO and PDO patterns. Instead, one is similar to the 1900\u20132002 trend and might represent anthropogenic effects, while the second represents multidecadal fluctuations of a pattern that potentially represents natural decadal variability; however, neither attribution can be made unambiguously with the analysis presented in this paper. Predictability of these two stationary eigenmodes is significantly enhanced by tropical\u2013North Pacific coupling. Neither stationary eigenmode is well captured in the control run of any coupled GCM in the CMIP-3 project of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), perhaps because in all of the GCMs tropical SST decadal variability is too weak and North Pacific SSTs are too independent of the Tropics.\n\nA key implication of this analysis is that the PDO may represent not a single physical mode but rather the sum of several phenomena, each of which represents a different red noise with its own autocorrelation time scale and spatial pattern. The sum of these red noises can give rise to apparent PDO \u201cregime shifts\u201d and seeming characteristics of a long memory process. Such shifts are not predictable beyond the time scale of the most rapidly decorrelating noise, less than two years, although the expected duration of regimes may be determined from the relative amplitudes of different eigenmodes.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice is an important climate component and often regarded as an early indicator of anthropogenic global change. For an assessment of coupled climate models, their performance with respect to the development of Arctic sea ice thickness during the 20th century is examined. Their behavior is compared with results from an ocean\u2013sea ice model using the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP) atmospheric forcing for the period 1948\u20132000. In lieu of actually observed sea ice thickness, this model result under realistic atmospheric forcing serves as a benchmark for the coupled climate models. The hindcast exhibits virtually no trend in Arctic ice volume over its integration period 1948\u20132000. Most of the coupled climate models show a negative trend over the 20th century that accelerates towards the end of that century.",

            "title": "On Intrinsic Uncertainties in Earth System Modelling",
            "abstract": "Uncertainties are pervasive in the Earth System modelling. This is not just due to a lack of knowledge about physical processes but has its seeds in intrinsic, i.e. inevitable and irreducible, uncertainties concerning the process of modelling as well. Therefore, it is indispensable to quantify uncertainty in order to determine, which are robust results under this inherent uncertainty. The central goal of this thesis is to explore how uncertainties map on the properties of interest such as phase space topology and qualitative dynamics of the system. We will address several types of uncertainty and apply methods of dynamical systems theory on a trendsetting field of climate research, i.e. the Indian monsoon.\n\nWith a monsoon model the uncertainty about the external influence of El Ni\u00f1o / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is determined. There is evidence that ENSO influences the variability of the Indian monsoon, but the underlying physical mechanism is discussed controversially. As a contribution to the debate three different hypotheses are tested of how ENSO and the Indian summer monsoon are linked. In this thesis the coupling through the trade winds is identified as key in linking these two key climate constituents. On the basis of this physical mechanism the observed monsoon rainfall data can be reproduced to a great extent. Moreover, this mechanism can be identified in two general circulation models (GCMs) for the present day situation and for future projections under climate change. ",

            "abstract": "Four simulations with atmosphere-ocean climate models have been produced using identical Last Glacial Maximum ice sheets, topography and greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the pre-industrial, the diagnosed radiative feedback parameter ranges between $-1.30$ and $-1.18 \\mathrm{Wm^{-2}K^{-1}}$, the tropical ocean sea-surface temperature decreases between $1.7$ and $2.7$ $^\\circ$ C, and Antarctic surface air temperature decreases by 7 to 11 \u00b0C. These values are all compatible with observational estimates, except for a tendency to underestimate the tropical ocean cooling.\nOn the other hand, the same models  have a climate sensitivity to CO$_2$ concentration doubling ranging between 2.1 and 3.9 K\nIt is therefore inappropriate to simply scale an observational estimate of LGM temperature to predict climate sensitivity.\nThis is mainly a consequence of the non-linear character of the cloud (mainly shortwave) feedback at low latitudes. Changes in albedo and cloud cover at mid and high latitudes are also important, but less so.}\n",

            "abstract": "A new set of Climate Change scenarios for 2050 for the Netherlands is produced recently. The scenarios span a wide range of possible future climate conditions, and include climate variables that are of interest to a broad user community. The scenario values are constructed by combining output from an ensemble of recent General Climate Model (GCM) simulations, Regional Climate Model (RCM) output, meteorological observations and a touch of expert judgment. For temperature, precipitation, potential evaporation and wind four scenarios are constructed, encompassing ranges of both global mean temperature rise in 2050 and the strength of the response of the dominant atmospheric circulation in the area of interest to global warming. For this particular area, wintertime precipitation is seen to increase between 3,5 and 7% per degree global warming, but mean summertime precipitation shows opposite signs depending on the assumed response of the circulation regime. Annual maximum daily mean wind speed shows small changes compared to the observed (natural) variability of this variable. Sea level rise in the North Sea in 2100 ranges between 35 and 85 cm. Preliminary assessment of the impact of the new scenarios on water management and coastal defence policies indicate that particularly dry summer scenarios and increased intensity of extreme daily precipitation deserves additional attention in the near future.",

The strength of these teleconnections seems to change over time. Using observations covering the last 128 years we show that these apparent changes can be explained by chance, stemming from sampling variability. This result is backed by experiments in which an atmosphere model is driven by 123 years of observed sea surface temperature. The possibility of ENSO teleconnection changes in a warming climate is further investigated using coupled GCMs driven by past and projected future greenhouse gas concentrations. These runs do not exclude physical changes in the teleconnection strength but do not agree on their magnitude and location. If existing at all, changes in the strength of ENSO teleconnection, other than obtained by chance, are small and will only be detectable on centennial time scales.",

Yet little attention has been paid to the response of these variables in the eastern Pacific Ocean and particularly south eastern Pacific Ocean to anthropogenic climate change. We wish in the following to complete this need by investigating the changes in the heat balance of the oceanic surface layer (air-sea processes and advective terms), at seasonal time scales which may be influenced by the forcing of greenhouse gases at secular time scales in the eastern Pacific with particular emphasis on two areas, Humboldt Current and Panama Bight systems. The Panama Bight  region is located north of the equator (9N-1S, 100W- coastal South America) and the Humboldt Current between 2S-40S, 90W and the coast of South America. In order to performe this research theme, we used monthly mean heat fluxes of all heat flux terms generated by various coupled general circulation models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. This will allow to gain an improved understanding of the sea surface temperature and the characteristics of the surface heat balance of the Humboldt Current and Panama Bight Systems, their spatial patterns, their seasonal structure, and how they evolve forced by greenhouse gases and other forcing under different scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Recent and potential future increases in global temperatures are likely to be associated with impacts on the hydrologic cycle, including changes to precipitation and increases in extreme events such as droughts. We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. The models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all future scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4-6 month duration) droughts from the mid 20th century to the end of the 21st. Long-term (more than 12 month duration) droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long term frequencies as do mid latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from natural variability for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the 21st century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means.",

            "abstract": "Expansion of irrigated land can cause local cooling of daytime temperatures by up to several degrees Celsius. Here we compare the expected cooling associated with rates of irrigation expansion in developing countries for historical (1961-2000) and future (2000-2030) periods with climate model predictions of temperature changes from other forcings, most notably increased atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, over the same periods. Indirect effects of irrigation on climate, via methane production in paddy rice systems, were not considered. In regions of rapid irrigation growth over the past 40 years, such as Northwest India and Northeast China, irrigation\u2019s expected cooling effects have been similar in magnitude to climate model predictions of warming from greenhouse gases. A masking effect of irrigation can therefore explain the lack of significant increases in observed growing season maximum temperatures in these regions and the apparent discrepancy between observations and climate model simulations. Projections of irrigation for 2000-2030 indicate a slowing of expansion rates, and therefore cooling from irrigation expansion over this time period will very likely be smaller than in recent decades. At the same time, warming from greenhouse gases will likely accelerate, and irrigation will play a relatively smaller role in agricultural climate trends. In many irrigated regions, therefore, temperature projections from climate models, which generally ignore irrigation, may be more accurate in predicting future temperature trends than their performance in reproducing past observed trends would suggest.",

            "abstract": "Models of yield responses to temperature change have often considered only changes in average temperature (Tavg), with the implicit assumption that changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR; the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperature) can safely be ignored. The goal of this study was to evaluate this assumption using a combination of historical datasets and climate model projections. Data on national crop yields for 1961-2002 in the 10 leading producers of wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), and maize (Zea mays) were combined with datasets on climate and crop locations to evaluate the empirical relationships between Tavg, DTR, and crop yields. In several rice and maize growing regions, including the two major nations for each crop, there was a clear negative response of yields to increased DTR. This finding reflects a nonlinear response of yields to temperature, which likely results from greater water and heat stress during hot days. In many other cases, the effects of DTR were not statistically significant, in part because correlations of DTR with other climate variables and the relatively short length of the time series resulted in wide confidence intervals for the estimates.\n\tTo evaluate whether future changes in DTR are relevant to crop impact assessments, yield responses to projected changes in Tavg and DTR by 2046-2065 from 11 climate models were estimated. The mean of climate model projections indicated an increase in DTR in most seasons and locations where wheat is grown, mixed projections for maize, and a general decrease in DTR for rice. These mean projections were associated with wide ranges that included zero in nearly all cases. The estimated impacts of DTR changes on yields were generally small (<5% change in yields) relative to the consistently negative impact of projected warming of Tavg. However, DTR changes did significantly affect yield responses in several cases, such as in reducing US maize yields and increasing India rice yields. Because DTR projections tend to be positively correlated with Tavg, estimates of yield changes for extreme warming were particularly affected by including DTR (up to 10%). Finally, based on the relatively poor performance of climate models in reproducing the magnitude of past DTR trends, it is possible that future DTR changes and associated yield responses will exceed the ranges considered here.\n",

            "abstract": "Warmer SST and more rain in the northern hemisphere are observed year-round\nin the tropical eastern Pacific. Southerly wind blows across the equator toward this atmospheric heating. Southerlies are minimal during boreal spring, when two\nprecipitation maxima straddle the equator. The climate of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere is analyzed in 15 coupled ocean-atmosphere models from 8 nations. Coupled models variously reproduce the observed meridional march with the seasons of sea surface temperature (SST) and intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) precipitation. Most models have too much rain in the southern hemisphere so that rain is nearly symmetric about the equator in the annual mean. In 8 out of 15 models the ITCZ alternates symmetrically between the hemispheres with the seasons. Simple metrics are introduced to diagnose model fidelity.\n\nSpread of the various solutions from the multi-model ensemble elucidates coupled\nphysics. The seasonally alternating ITCZ error generates two wind speed maxima per year, one northerly and one southerly, resulting in a semiannual cycle of equatorial SST and a cool bias of the equatorial ocean. A spurious cooling occurs in March on the equator in some models. March cold tongue temperature among the models is correlated to the scalar speed of cross-equatorial wind at \u20130.6. Models tend to simulate too weak a meridional asymmetry. Weaker than observed meridional wind within 1000 km of the South American coast explains a warm SST error. SST on the equator (80-90\u00ba W, 2\u00ba S-2\u00ba N) is correlated to meridional wind speed at \u20130.66 among models.\n\nNortheasterly wind jets blow over the Central American isthmus in winter and\ncool the SST in the eastern Pacific warm pool. In some models the strength of these winds contributes to the early demise of their northern ITCZ relative to observations. The February-April northerly wind bias on the equator is correlated to the antecedent December-February Central American Pacific wind speed at \u20130.87, suggesting an atmospheric connection between the Central American northeasterlies and the southward shift of the ITCZ.\n\nThe various representations of stratus clouds among models clearly affect the\nunderlying SST, but their effect on the meridional atmospheric circulation is difficult to discern from the multi-model ensemble. This study identifies several features to be improved in atmospheric and coupled GCMs, including the northeasterly cross-Central American wind in winter and the meridional wind on the equator. It suggests that both the double ITCZ error and equatorial SST errors in the eastern Pacific could be alleviated by reducing errors in the climatology of meridional wind.",

In contrast\nto the strengthening and contraction of the Hadley cell and the equatorward shift of the\ntropospheric zonal jets in response to El Nino, the Hadley cell weakens and expands poleward, and\nthe jets move poleward under a warmed climate, despite the ~SEl Nino-like~T enhanced warming over\nequatorial central and eastern Pacific.\nTwo feasible mechanisms are proposed for the zonal mean circulation response to global warming:\n(1) The increase in static stability of the subtropical and mid-latitude troposphere, a result of\nthe quasi-moist adiabatic adjustment to the surface warming, tends to stabilize the eddy growth\non the equatorward side of the storm track and push the eddy activity and the associated\neddy-driven wind and subsidence poleward, leading to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell\nand the shift of jet; (2) the strengthening of the mid-latitude wind at the upper-troposphere and\nlower-stratosphere, arguably a consequence of the rise in the height of the tropopause and the\nassociated increase in the meridional temperature gradient, can increase the phase speed of the\neddies emanating from the mid-latitudes, and thus the critical latitudes (where the eddy phase\nspeed matches the background zonal wind, and where the eddies break and extract angular momentum\nfrom the thermally driven wind) displace poleward and carry the eddy-driven circulation with it.\nBoth mechanisms are somewhat, if not completely, distinct from those in response to the El Nino\ncondition. The hydrological impacts of global warming also exhibit distinct patterns over the\nsubtropics and mid-latitudes in comparison to the El Nino.\nSince both mechanisms do not essentially depend on the details of the SST warming in the\nequatorial oceans and the variety of model physical parameterizations, these extratropical\nresponses to global warming may be of increased credence due to the fact that they are\ndynamically determined.",

            "abstract": "While most of the global climate models (GCMs) currently being evaluated for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report simulate present-day Arctic sea ice in reasonably good agreement with observations, the intermodel differences in simulated Arctic cloud cover are large and produce significant differences in downwelling longwave radiation. Using the standard thermodynamic models of sea ice, we find that the GCM-generated spread in longwave radiation produces equilibrium ice thicknesses that range from 1 to more than 10 meters. However, equilibrium ice thickness is an extremely sensitive function of the ice albedo, allowing errors in simulated cloud cover to be compensated by tuning of the ice albedo. This analysis suggests that the results of current GCMs cannot be relied upon at face value for credible predictions of future Arctic sea ice.",

            "abstract": "We examine the trajectory of Arctic summer sea ice in seven projections from the Community Climate System Model and find that abrupt reductions are a common feature of these 21st century simulations. These events have decreasing September ice extent trends that are typically 4 times larger than comparable observed trends. One event exhibits a decrease from 6 million square km to 2 million square km in a decade, reaching near ice-free September conditions by 2040. In the simulations, ice retreat accelerates as thinning increases the open water formation efficiency for a given melt rate and the ice-albedo feedback increases shortwave absorption. The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing. Analysis from multiple climate models and three forcing scenarios indicates that abrupt reductions occur in simulations from over 50% of the models and suggests that reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions moderate the likelihood of these events.",

The onset, end, and total rainfall during the summer monsoon are investigated using precipitation pentad estimates from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (1979-2004). Likewise, the variability of SAMS characteristics are investigated using the intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) coupled global climate model for Interdisciplinary Research (MIROC) in the 20th century (1981-2000) and in a scenario with the double present concentration of CO2 (2xCO2) (2061-2080).. It is shown that the spatial variability of the onsets over central Brazil simulated by MIROC for the 20th century run corresponds very well to the observations. Moreover, there is indication of change in the tails of the seasonal precipitation distributions over the savanna for the scenario with 2xCO2, comparatively to the present climate. This suggests changes in the probability of extremes (dry or wet) events over that region in a scenario with 2xCO2, which indicates according to MIROC the large exposure of the region to possible consequences of climate changes resulting from increasing greenhouse gases.",

Dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the vast Southern Ocean can influence large-scale surface climate features on various time scales. Its climatic relevance stems in part from it being the region where most of the transformation of the World Ocean's water masses occur. In climate change experiments that simulate greenhouse gas-induced warming. Southern Ocean air-sea heat fluxes and three-dimensional circulation patterns make it a region where much of the future oceanic heat storage takes place, though the magnitude of that heat storage is one of the larger sources of uncertainty associated with the transient climate response in such model projections. Factors such as the Southern Ocean's wind forcing, heat, and salt budgets are linked to the structure and transport of the ACC in ways that have not been expresed clearly in the literature. These links are explored here in a coupled model context by analyzing a sizable suite of preindustrial control experiments associated with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report. A framework is developed that uses measures of coupled model simulation characteristics, primarily those related to the Southern Ocean wind forcing and water mass properties, to allow one to categorize, and to some extent predict, which models do better or worse at simulating the Southern Ocean and why. Hopefully, this framework will also lead to increased understanding of the ocean's response to climate changes.",

Greater snow cover fraction leads to higher albedo and lower temperatures at 1xCO2 but has less influence at 2xCO2 when little snow remains due to global warming. This makes the simulation with higher albedo at 1xCO2 more sensitive to increased CO2, in agreement with past work. We show that the wide variation in simulated snow-albedo feedbacks and climate sensitivities among 15 other models correlates well with variations in the continental middle to high latitude present-day springtime albedo, in agreement with our CAM results.

Results from comprehensive numerical models of the climate system are fundamentally important for understanding climate processes and how climate has changed in the past and may change in the future.\nSome time ago CSIRO completed its submission to the IPCC AR4 Model database a set of experiments simulating past, present and future climate with the Mk3 Climate System. The Mk3 model has been in development and used for production climate runs for the best part of a decade and is the end result of a significant commitment of financial and intellectual resources from a relatively small group of developers and stakeholders.\nThe task of processing, deriving, validating and submitting Mk3 output provided significant computing and logistic challenges. Data requirements were substantially more demanding than ever before and the schedule for inclusion in the AR4 database was extremely tight. Particularly when several key model experiments were still underway when the call for data (from JSC/CLIVAR WGCM) came. However, the importance of contributing to the IPCC AR4 with a climate model developed in the Southern Hemisphere cannot be underestimated. This effort will provide a useful \u201cmodel development\u201d yardstick for the ACCESS  climate model development program that is underway in Australia. The best indicator of the Mk3 outcome is the inclusion of its performance in hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles and the many contractual reports completed and underway.\nWe briefly described the system for managing Mk3 model output based on a modern, locally developed, scripting computer language for the efficient processing of large and complex datasets. This system takes into account different Mk3 model configurations and model output inconsistencies and is able to generate a temporally, spatially and physically consistent set of data products. An essential feature is the ability to make the model results self describing (CF-compliant netCDF files) to enable efficient uptake by researchers. Experiences with data validation and quality control checking is described, an often overlooked aspect of data delivery. Our goal was to make the Mk3 model output easily accessible its to the international climate research community.\nIn this presentation a brief history of the development and features of the CSIRO Mk3 model will be provided. The Mk3.5 version of the climate model includes many improvements over its predecessor resulting in a control climate with a relatively small drift.  This new and updated archive of model outputs will provide the local and international community with a wealth of informative and sophisticated climate model experiments for completion of important institutional studies. An indication of the regional demands for Mk3 outputs will be given. Details of how to access the CSIRO Mk3.0 and Mk3.5 data will be provided.\n",

How can we determine whether specific regional climate projections may be untrustworthy in the light of such generic deficiencies? A calibration method is proposed whose basis lies in the emerging notion of seamless prediction. Specifically, calibrations of ensemble-based climate-change probabilities are derived from analyses of the statistical reliability of ensemble-based forecast probabilities on seasonal timescales. The method is demonstrated by calibrating probabilistic projections from the multi-model ensembles used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on reliability analyses from the seasonal-forecast DEMETER dataset. The focus in this paper is on climate-change projections of regional precipitation, though the method is more general.",

The results demonstrate good model agreement in quantities that have had a robust global observational basis and that are physically unambiguous.  The worst agreement occurs for quantities that have both poor observational constraints and whose model representations can be physically ambiguous.  In addition, components involving water vapor (frozen water) typically exhibit the best (worst) agreement, and fluxes typically exhibit better agreement than reservoirs.

            "abstract": "The extent to which the climate will change due to an external forcing depends largely on\nradiative feedbacks, which act to amplify or damp the surface temperature response. Differences\nin the representation of these feedbacks are directly responsible for the uncertainty in current\nmodel estimates of climate sensitivity. There are a variety of issues that complicate the analysis\nof radiative feedbacks in global climate models (GCMs), resulting in some confusion regarding\ntheir strength and distribution. In this paper, we present a method for quantifying climate\nfeedbacks based on \u201cradiative kernels\u201d which describe the differential response of the top-ofatmosphere\nradiative fluxes to incremental changes in the feedback variables. The use of\nradiative kernels enables one to decompose the feedback into one part that depends on the\nradiative transfer algorithm and the unperturbed climate state, and a second part that arises\nfrom the climate response of the feedback variables. Such decomposition facilitates an\nunderstanding of the spatial characteristics of the feedbacks and the causes of intermodel\ndifferences. This technique has the advantage of requiring fewer computations and being easier\nto implement than \u201cpartial radiative perturbation\u201d methods. More importantly, it provides a\nsimple and accurate way to compare feedbacks across different models using a consistent\nmethodology. Cloud feedbacks cannot be evaluated directly from a cloud radiative kernel\nbecause of strong nonlinearities, but they can be estimated from the change in cloud forcing and\nthe difference between the full-sky and clear-sky kernels. Our results using this method confirm\nthat models typically generate globally-averaged cloud feedbacks that are substantially positive\nor near neutral, unlike the change in cloud forcing itself which is as often negative as positive.",

            "abstract": "The relationships of upper tropospheric water vapor\n(UTWV), cloud ice and sea surface temperature (SST) are\nexamined in the annual cycles of ECMWF analyses and\nsimulations from 15 atmosphere-ocean coupled models\nwhich were contributed to the IPCC AR4. The results are\ncompared with the observed relationships based on UTWV\nand cloud ice measurements from MLS on Aura. It is shown\nthat the ECMWF analyses produce positive correlations\nbetween UTWV, cloud ice and SST, similar to the MLS\ndata. The rate of the increase of cloud ice and UTWV with\nSST is about 30% larger than that for MLS. For the IPCC\nsimulations, the relationships between UTWV, cloud ice\nand SST are qualitatively captured. However, the\nmagnitudes of the simulated cloud ice show a\nconsiderable disagreement between models, by nearly a\nfactor of 10. The amplitudes of the approximate linear\nrelations between UTWV, cloud ice and SST vary by a\nfactor up to 4. Citation: Su, H., D. E. Waliser, J. H. Jiang, J. Li,\nW. G. Read, J. W. Waters, and A.

The method indicates that in many models there is a significant rapid tropospheric adjustment to CO2 leading to changes in cloud, and reducing the effective radiative forcing, in a way analogous to the indirect and semi-direct effects of aerosol. By contrast, in most models the cloud feedback is small, defined as the part of the change which evolves with Delta-T. Comparison with forcing evaluated by fixing sea surface conditions gives qualitatively similar results for the cloud components of forcing, both  globally and locally. Tropospheric adjustment to CO2 may be responsible for some of the model spread in equilibrium climate sensitivity, and could affect time-dependent climate projections.",

            "title": "Increasing CO2 may compensate for the adverse effects of changing climate on China's ecosystems",
            "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 and China\u2019s climate have changed greatly since 1961.  How increased CO2 and changing climate influence the carbon cycle of the terrestrial China ecosystems is still unclear although it is important to understand the carbon dynamics.  In this article, we used a process-based ecosystem model, Biome-BGC, to isolate the effects of changing climate and elevated atmospheric CO2 on the terrestrial China carbon cycle during two time periods, (1) the present (1961-2000) and (2) a future with projected climate change under doubled CO2 (2071-2110).  The effects of climate change alone were estimated by driving Biome-BGC with the fixed CO2 and the changing climate, and the CO2 fertilization effects were the difference of the results driven by both increasing CO2 and changing climate to those by variable climate alone.  Model simulations indicate that, during 1961-2000, at the national scale, climate change alone reduced carbon stored in China\u2019s ecosystems, but increasing CO2 compensated for the adverse effects of climate change, resulting in the increased carbon storage by China\u2019s ecosystems despite of the decreased soil carbon.  The interannual variability of the carbon cycle was associated with climate variations.  Spatially, the normally reduced carbon in vegetation and soils, and the raised carbon in litter were mainly caused by climate change in most parts of East China, while carbon in vegetation, soils and litter increased nearly all over West China.  In the future (2071-2110), with doubled CO2, higher precipitation and temperature will occur all over China as predicted by the Hadley Centre HadCM3 for the IPCC Fourth Assessment.  The concomitant doubling of CO2 will continue to counteract the negative effects of climate change on carbon uptake in the future, leading to an increase in carbon storage relative to the present.  Regional differences in climate change produced differing regional carbon uptake responses.  This study highlights the role of CO2 fertilization in the carbon budget of China ecosystems, though it did not include other important processes such as land use change, human management practices (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and environmental pollutions, etc.",

Although the simulated warming makes snow season to shorten from its both ends in all of Eurasia and North America, SWE at the height of the winter generally increases in the coldest areas. Elsewhere, snow decreases throughout the winter. The average borderline between increasing and decreasing midwinter SWE coincides broadly with the &#8722;20\u00b0C isotherm in late 20th century November\u2013March mean temperature, although with some variability between different areas. On the colder side of this isotherm, an increase in total precipitation generally dominates over reduced fraction of solid precipitation and more efficient melting, and SWE therefore increases. On the warmer side, where the phase of winter precipitation and snowmelt are more sensitive to the simulated warming, the reverse happens. The strong temperature dependence of the simulated SWE changes suggests that projections of SWE change could be potentially improved by taking into account biases in simulated present-day winter temperatures. A probabilistic cross verification exercise supports this suggestion.",

            "abstract": "Observed changes in the timing of snowmelt dominated streamflow in the western United States are often linked to anthropogenic or other external causes. We assess whether observed streamflow timing changes can be statistically attributed to external forcing, or whether they still lie within the bounds of natural (internal) variability for four large Sierra Nevada (CA) basins, at inflow points to major reservoirs. Streamflow timing is measured by \u2018\u2018center timing\u2019\u2019 (CT), the day when half the annual flow has passed a given point. We use a physically based hydrology model driven by meteorological input from a global climate model to quantify the natural variability in CT trends. Estimated\n50-year trends in CT due to natural climate variability often exceed estimated actual CT trends from 1950 to 1999. Thus, although observed trends in CT to date may be statistically significant, they cannot yet be statistically attributed to external influences on climate. We estimate that projected CT changes at the four major reservoir inflows will, with 90% confidence, exceed those from natural variability within 1\u20134 decades or 4\u20138 decades, depending on rates of future greenhouse gas emissions. To identify areas most likely to exhibit CT changes in response to rising temperatures, we calculate changes in CT under temperature increases from 1 to 5\u0001. We find that areas with  average winter temperatures between \u00012\u0001C and \u00014\u0001C are most likely to respond with\nsignificant CT shifts. Correspondingly, elevations from 2000 to 2800 m are most sensitive to temperature increases, with CT changes exceeding 45 days (earlier) relative to 1961\u20131990.",

For the mid-Holocene (MH, 6,000 years ago), the models are forced by changes in the Earth\u2019s orbital parameters. The MH PMIP1 atmosphere-only simulations conducted with sea surface temperatures fixed to modern conditions show no MH consistent response for the poles, whereas the new PMIP2 coupled atmosphere\u2013 ocean climate models systematically simulate a significant MH warming both for Greenland (but smaller than ice-core based estimates) and Antarctica (consistent with the range of ice-core based range). In both PMIP1 and PMIP2, the MH annual mean changes in global temperature are negligible, consistent with the MH orbital forcing. The simulated last glacial maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) to pre-industrial change in global mean temperature ranges between 3 and 7degC in PMIP1 and PMIP2 model runs, similar to the range of temperature change expected from a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the CMIP simulations. Both LGM and future climate simulations are associated with a polar amplification of climate change. The range of glacial polar amplification in Greenland is strongly dependent on the ice sheet elevation changes prescribed to the climate models. All PMIP2 simulations systematically underestimate the reconstructed glacial\u2013interglacial Greenland temperature change, while some of the simulations do capture the reconstructed glacial\u2013interglacial Antarctic temperature change. Uncertainties in the prescribed central ice cap elevation cannot account for the temperature change underestimation by climate models. The variety of climate model sensitivities enables the exploration of the relative changes in polar temperature with respect to changes in global temperatures. Simulated changes of polar temperatures are strongly related to changes in simulated global temperatures for both future and LGM climates, confirming that ice-core-based reconstructions provide quantitative insights on global climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Ice cores provide unique archives of past climate and environmental changes based only on physical processes. Quantitative temperature reconstructions are essential for the comparison between ice core records and climate models. We give an overview of the methods that have been developed to reconstruct past local temperatures from deep ice cores and highlight several points that are relevant for future climate change.\nWe first analyse the long term fluctuations of temperature as depicted in the long Antarctic record from EPICA Dome C. The long term imprint of obliquity changes in the EPICA Dome C record is highlighted and compared to simulations conducted with the ECBILT-CLIO intermediate complexity climate model. We discuss the comparison between the current interglacial period and the long interglacial corresponding to marine isotopic stage 11, ca. 400 kyr BP. Previous studies had focused on the role of precession and the thresholds required to induce glacial inceptions. We suggest that, due to the low eccentricity configuration of MIS 11 and the Holocene, the effect of precession on the incoming solar radiation is damped and that changes in obliquity must be taken into account. The EPICA Dome C alignment of terminations I and VI published in 2004 corresponds to a phasing of the obliquity signals. A conjunction of low obliquity and minimum northern hemisphere summer insolation is not found in the next tens of thousand years, supporting the idea of an unusually long interglacial ahead.\nAs a second point relevant for future climate change, we discuss the magnitude and rate of change of past temperatures reconstructed from Greenland (NorthGRIP) and Antarctic (Dome C) ice cores. Past episodes of temperatures above the present-day values by up to 5degC are recorded at both locations during the penultimate interglacial period. The rate of polar warming simulated by coupled climate models forced by a CO2 increase of 1% per year is compared to ice-core-based temperature reconstructions. In Antarctica, the CO2-induced warming lies clearly beyond the natural rhythm of temperature fluctuations. In Greenland, the CO2-induced warming is as fast or faster than the most rapid temperature shifts of the last ice age. The magnitude of polar temperature change in response to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 is comparable to the magnitude of the polar temperature change from the Last Glacial Maximum to present-day. When forced by prescribed changes in ice sheet reconstructions and CO2 changes, climate models systematically underestimate the glacial-interglacial polar temperature change.",

            "abstract": "The state-of-the-art AOGCM simulations has recently (late 2004 - early 2005) been completed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in order to provide input to the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The present paper synthesizes the new simulations of both the 20th- and 21st-century arctic freshwater budget components for use in the IPCC AR4, and attempts to determine whether demonstrable progress has been achieved since the late 1990s. Precipitation and its difference with evapotranspiration are addressed over the Arctic Ocean and its terrestrial watersheds, including the basins of the four major rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean: the Ob, the Yenisey, the Lena, and the Mackenzie. Compared to the previous (IPCC Third Assessment Report, TAR) generation of AOGCMs, there are some indications that the models as a class have improved in simulations of the arctic precipitation. In spite of observational uncertainties, the models still appear to oversimulate area-averaged precipitation over the major river basins. The model-mean precipitation biases in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have retained their major geographical patterns, which are at least partly attributable to the insufficiently resolved local orography, as well as to biases in large scale atmospheric circulation and sea-ice distribution. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean is also slightly oversimulated. The simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean is in qualitative agreement between the models as well as with observational and reanalysis data. This is also generally the case for the seasonality of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean\u2019s terrestrial watersheds, with a few exceptions. Some agreement is demonstrated by the models in reproducing positive 20th century trends of precipitation in the Arctic, as well as positive area-averaged P-E late-20th century trends over the entire terrestrial watershed of the Arctic Ocean.\nFor the 21st century, three scenarios are considered: A2, A1B, and B1. Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and its watersheds increases through the 21st century, showing much faster percentage increases than the global mean precipitation. The arctic precipitation changes have a pronounced seasonality, with the strongest relative increase in winter and fall, and the weakest in summer. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean increases for all scenarios from all major river basins considered, and is generally about twice as large as the increase of freshwater from precipitation over the Arctic Ocean (70-90\u00b0N) itself. The across-model scatter of the precipitation increase for each scenario is significant, but smaller than the scatter between the climates of the different models in the baseline period.",

            "title": "ntrinsic versus forced variation in coupled climate model simulations over the Arctic during the 20th Century",
            "abstract": "There were two major multi-year, Arctic-wide (60-90&#61616;N) warm anomalies (> 0.7&#61616;C) in land surface air temperature (LSAT) during the 20th century, between 1920-1950 and again at the end of the century after 1979. Reproducing this decadal and longer variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, with considerable variability in amplitude among models. In contrast only eight models generated warm anomaly amplitude at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization, but not its timing. The durations of the mid-century warm events in all the models are decadal, while that of the observed was interdecadal. The variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations. The random timing of mid-century warm anomalies in 20C3M simulations and the similar variance of the control runs in about half of the models suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability. Five models were considered to compare somewhat favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance of the observed temperature record in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly amplitude in their 20C3M simulations. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper presents a methodology to downscale monthly precipitation to river basin scale in Indian context\nfor special report of emission scenarios (SRES) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the methodology presented,\nprobable predictor variables are extracted from (1) the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis\ndata set for the period 1971\u20132000 and (2) the simulations from the third generation Canadian general circulation model\n(CGCM3) for SRES emission scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT for the period 1971\u20132100. These variables include\nboth the thermodynamic and dynamic parameters and those which have a physically meaningful relationship with the\nprecipitation. The NCEP variables which are realistically simulated by CGCM3 are chosen as potential predictors for\nseasonal stratification. The seasonal stratification involves identification of (1) the past wet and dry seasons through\nclassification of the NCEP data on potential predictors into two clusters by the use of K-means clustering algorithm\nand (2) the future wet and dry seasons through classification of the CGCM3 data on potential predictors into two clusters\nby the use of nearest neighbour rule. Subsequently, a separate downscaling model is developed for each season to capture\nthe relationship between the predictor variables and the predictand. For downscaling precipitation, the predictand is chosen\nas monthly Thiessen weighted precipitation for the river basin, whereas potential predictors are chosen as the NCEP\nvariables which are correlated to the precipitation and are also realistically simulated by CGCM3. Implementation of the\nmethodology presented is demonstrated by application to Malaprabha reservoir catchment in India which is considered to\nbe a climatically sensitive region. The CGCM3 simulations are run through the calibrated and validated SVM downscaling\nmodel to obtain future projections of predictand for each of the four emission scenarios considered. The results show\nthat the precipitation is projected to increase in future for almost all the scenarios considered. The projected increase in\nprecipitation is high for A2 scenario, whereas it is least for COMMIT scenario.",

The \nspace-time structure of low-frequency variations are extracted using Optimal Persistence \nAnalysis, which is a technique that linearly decomposes a vector time series into a set of \nuncorrelated components, ordered such that the first component maximizes the decorrelation \ntime, the second maximizes the decorrelation time subject to being uncorrelated with the first, \nand so on.  The results suggests that only the first two optimal persistence patterns (OPPs) in the \nobservation-based record are statistically distinguishable from white noise.  These two \ncomponents can reproduce the spatial structure of local linear trends over various multi-decadal \nperiods, indicating that they give an efficient representation of the observed change in surface \ntemperature.  In contrast, most simulations suggest the existence of a single physically significant \nOPP, all with qualitatively similar time series but each with somewhat different spatial structure. \nThe leading OPP computed from the full model grid, and from the observation based grid and \nmissing data masked out, are surprisingly consistent with each other, suggesting that the \nobservation-based grid does not pose a serious barrier to extracting the dominant low-frequency \nvariations in the global climate system.

The analysis is confined to the SST anomalies along the equatorial Pacific and is based on the use of a non-linear neural classification algorithm, the Self-Organizing Maps. Systematic biases include a larger than observed proportion for modelled ENSO maximum variability occurring in the Western Pacific. No clear relationship is found between this bias and the characteristics of the modelled mean state bias in the equatorial Pacific. This bias is mainly related to a misrepresentation of both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a termination phases for most of the models. In contrast, the onset phase is quite well simulated. Modelled El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a peak phases display an asymmetric bias. Whereas the main bias of the modelled El Ni\u00f1o peak is to exhibit a maximum in the western Pacific, the simulated La Ni\u00f1a bias mainly occurs in the central Pacific. In addition, some models are able to capture the observed El Ni\u00f1o peak characteristics while none of them realistically simulate La Ni\u00f1a peaks. It also arises that the models closest to the observations score unevenly in reproducing the different phases, preventing an accurate classification of the models quality to reproduce the overall ENSO-like variability.",

If we allow for carbon dioxide fertilization, the desert areas become\nsmaller. Thus better understanding carbon dioxide fertilization is important for\npredicting desert response to climate. There is substantial spread in the model simulation\npredictions for regional and global averages.",

Enhanced activity is also found over the Asian continent and over the North Pacific near the Aleutian Islands. At high latitudes and over parts the subtropics, activity is reduced.

            "abstract": "Forest fires are a global hazard. Antarctica is the only continent entirely free from the combinations of fuels, weather conditions and ignition sources, which provide a potential wildfire hazard. Some regions such as California, Australia and the Mediterranean exhibit particular susceptibility to forest fires, and research throughout the 20th century established a strong correlation between meteorological variables and fire occurrence and extent. Since then, a number of fire-weather indices have been established which allow the seasonal and daily forecasting of fire hazards in these regions. The past decade has seen significant interest in the impact of anthropogenic climate forcing on the occurrence of forest fires, focused on the most fire-prone regions, predicting overall increases in fire-weather in Australia, Spain, Portugal and South-west U.S.A. An increase in fire-susceptibility has also been predicted for parts of the boreal forests of Canada and Russia. However, no global overview has been presented, and little interest is given to regions with a currently low fire danger, which may or may not experience an increase in forest fire occurrence in the future.\n\n\n\nThis study asks \u2018can we expect a change in the global distribution of forest fires due to anthropogenic climate change?\u2019 This question is of great significance due to the environmental, social and economic damage caused by forest fires. This damage may possibly be even greater in regions previously free of major fire hazards as they lack the management experience of current fire-prone regions. The increased occurrence of fire in forested regions not adapted to periodic fire seasons may also have significant ecological impact. \n\n\n\nA secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of a regional fire weather index to the global climate model. This study uses the ECHAM climate model data for the 4th IPCC Assessment along with the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) to compare the global distribution of forest fire weather in 2080 under a 2xCO2 climate with that of today. The model results are validated against observed forest fire data for the past 20 years. This validation enables the study to be evaluated as a model for predicting the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the global distribution of the forest fire hazard.\n\n\n\nValidation of the model suggests that it is useful as a predictive tool on a global scale, and also on a regional scale in Africa, China, Canada and Europe. For other regions alterations to the model are required to produce a more useful output. This study predicts a significant overall increase in global forest fire danger, with significant increases in Australia, Africa, South America, China, Canada and Europe. Other regions are predicted insignificant changes in fire danger.\n\n",

The observed SD shows a dominant semiannual signal due to the semiannual variation in the local Ekman upwelling resulting from a combination of the term related to the wind stress curl and the zonal wind stress.  However, all models failed to reproduce this important mechanism.  In particular, the latter contribution, which is determined by the seasonal variation of the zonal wind stress associated with the Indian monsoon, is not well simulated.  Successful models need to reproduce the asymmetric nature of the monsoon: shorter and stronger summer monsoon and longer and weaker winter monsoon.  Possible remedies for the model bias are also discussed.",

In order to investigate the effect of this simplification in ASGCMs on ECS estimation, a climate feedback analysis was performed doubled CO2 equilibrium experiments (2XCO2) by ASGCM and 1% per year CO2 increase experiments (1%CO2) by atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs, in which physical processes in the ocean are considered explicitly). In some models, the strength of ice-albedo and cloud feedback in 2XCO2 is different from those in 1%CO2. The possible factors controlling these feedbacks in 1%CO2 seem more reliable than those \nin 2XCO2 because the ocean physical processes are accounted for appropriately in 1%CO2. If we assume the strength of ice-albedo and cloud feedback in 1%CO2 to be more accurate than that in 2XCO2, the ECS changes about 1 K in some models. In order to decrease the uncertainty in estimating ECS resulting from such artificial problems in the experimental settings of ASGCMs, it is important to make the initial sea ice distribution and the surface temperature response as realistic as possible.

Here we show results from two global coupled climate models run with anthropogenic and natural forcings separately. Averaged over the continental U.S., they show that the observed changes in the four temperature extremes are accounted for with anthropogenic forcings, but not with natural forcings (even though there are some differences in the details of the forcings). This indicates that most of the changes in temperature extremes over the U.S. are likely due to human activity.",

            "abstract": "We present an approach to testing climate models with observations. In this approach, it is possible to directly observe the longwave feedbacks of the climate system in timeseries of annual average outgoing longwave spectra. Tropospheric temperature, stratospheric temperature, water vapor, and carbon dioxide have clear and distinctive signatures in the infrared spectrum, and it is possible to detect trends of these signals unambiguously from trends in the outgoing longwave spectrum by optimal detection techniques. We apply this approach to clear-sky data in the Tropics simulated from the output of an ensemble of climate models. Estimates of the water vapor-longwave feedback by this approach agree to within estimated errors with truth, and it is likely that an uncertainty of 50% can be obtained in twenty years of a continuous timeseries. The correlation of tropospheric temperature and water vapor anomalies can provide a constraint on the water vapor-longwave feedback to 5% uncertainty in twenty years, or 7% in ten years. Thus, it should be possible to place a strong constraint on climate models, which currently show a range of 30% in the water vapor-longwave feedback, in just ten years\u2019 time. These results may not hold in the presence of clouds, however, and so it may be necessary to supplement timeseries of outgoing longwave spectra with GPS radio occultation data, which is insensitive to clouds.",

This paper analyses the vulnerability of the beach tourism sector towards climate change by means of an index approach on a country level. A vulnerability framework for the tourism sector is developed and on its basis, indicators are defined for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. A transparent index approach, including a robustness analysis with multiple transformation methods and weighting sets, yields an assessment of the overall relative vulnerability of the beach tourism sector in 51 countries. Aggregate results on an annual level indicate that large developing countries might be among the most vulnerable, small islands states are also vulnerable, especially due to their high sensitivity, and developed high latitude countries as well as Mediterranean countries are amongst the least vulnerable. Despite several limitations of the index approach, the present study contributes to integrating the numerous direct as well as indirect effects climate change may have on beach tourism.",

This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, with the records in Central England going back to 1659, in the Netherlands to 1706 and in Denmark to 1768. The deviations were so large that under the obviously false assumption that the climate does not change, the observed temperatures for 2006 would occur with a probability of less than once every 10 000 years in a large part of Europe, given the distribution defined by the temperatures in the autumn 1901\u20132005. \n\nA better description of the temperature distribution is to assume that the mean changes proportional to the global mean temperature, but the shape of the distribution remains the same. This includes to first order the effects of global warming. Even under this assumption the autumn temperatures were very unusual, with estimates of the return time of 200 to 2000 years in this region. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is more than 100 to 300 years. \n\nApart from global warming, linear effects of a southerly circulation are found to give the largest contributions, explaining about half of the anomalies. SST anomalies in the North Sea were also important along the coast. ",

For model evaluation, the simulated indices representing the present climate were compared with indices based on observational data. This comparison shows that the model is able to realistically capture the observed climatological large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation indices, although the quality of the simulations depends on the index and region under consideration. In the climate projections for the twenty-first century, all considered temperature-based indices, minimum Tmin, maximum Tmax, and the frequency of tropical nights, show a significant increase worldwide. Similarly, extreme precipitation, as represented by the maximum 5-day precipitation and the 95th percentile of precipitation, is projected to increase significantly in most regions of the world, especially in those that are relatively wet already under present climate conditions. Analogously, dry spells increase particularly in those regions that are characterized by dry conditions in present-day climate. Future changes in the indices exhibit distinct regional and seasonal patterns as identified exemplarily in three European regions.",

            "abstract": "Sea-ice thickness is a key parameter for estimates of salt fluxes to the ocean and the contribution to global thermohaline circulation. Observations of sea-ice thickness in the Southern Ocean are sparse and difficult to collect. An exception to this data gap is time-series data from upward-looking sonars (ULS) which sample the drifting sea ice continuously. In this study we use ULS data from ten different locations over periods ranging from 9 to 25 months to compare with model data. Although these data are limited in space and time, they provide a qualitative indication of the ability of global climate models (GCMs) to adequately represent Southern Ocean sea ice. We compare the ULS data to output from four different GCMs (BCCR-BCM2.0, ECHAM5/MPI-OM, UKMO-HadCM3 and NCAR CCSM3) which were used for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They simulate the ice thickness reasonably well, but in most cases average model ice thickness is less than thicknesses derived from ULS data. The seasonal cycle produced by the models correlates well with the ULS except for locations near Maud Rise, where in summer the ULS find a low concentration of thick ice floes. This overly thin ice will have implications for both the salt flux to the central Weddell Sea during the growth season and the freshwater flux during the melt season. Using satellite-derived ice-drift data to calculate transports in the Weddell Sea, we find that the underestimation of ice thickness results in underestimated salt fluxes.",

This includes an analysis of sea ice transport and storage, ocean transport and storage, and net surface flux exchange. Simulated budgets for the late 20th century are compared to available observations, followed by an analysis of simulated changes from 1950 to 2050. The consistent theme over this period is an acceleration of the Arctic hydrological cycle, which is expressed as an increase in the flux of water passing through the hydrologic elements. Increased freshwater inputs to the ocean from net precipitation, river runoff, and net ice\nmelt result. While generally attended by a larger export of liquid freshwater to lower latitudes, primarily through Fram Strait, liquid freshwater storage in the Arctic Ocean increases. In contrast, the export and storage of freshwater in the form of sea ice decreases. The qualitative agreement between models for which the only common forcing is rising greenhouse gas concentrations implicates this greenhouse gas loading as the cause of the change. Although the models perform quite well in their simulations of net precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and terrestrial drainage, they differ significantly regarding the magnitude of the trends and their representation of contemporary mean ocean and sea ice\nbudget terms. To reduce uncertainty in future projections of the Arctic freshwater cycle, the climate models as a group require considerable improvement in these aspects of their simulations.",

            "abstract": "A snowpack model sensitivity study, observed changes of snow cover in the NOAA satellite data set and snow cover simulations from the CMIP3 multi-model dataset are used to provide new insights into the climate response of northern hemisphere snow cover. Under conditions of warming and increasing precipitation which characterizes both observed and projected climate change over much of Northern Hemisphere land area with seasonal snow cover, the sensitivity analysis indicated snow cover duration (SCD) had the highest climate sensitivity with sensitivity varying with climate regime and elevation.  The largest SCD-climate sensitivity was associated with maritime climates with extensive winter snowfall (e.g. western cordillera of North America - NA).  Analysis of significant local changes in snow cover duration over the 1967-1998 period of NOAA data showed that significant decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of -5\u00b0 to +2\u00b0C which extended around the coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models which showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) with the zone of earliest significant decreases located over the maritime margins of NA and Western Europe. The lowest SCD-climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relative cold, dry winters and short snow cover seasons where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing T and P in mountain regions due to non-linear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.",

In a formal detection and attribution analysis using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated \"fingerprint\" pattern of anthropogenically-caused changes in water vapor is identifiable with high statistical confidence in the SSM/I data. Experiments in which forcing factors are varied individually suggest that this fingerprint \"match\" is primarily due to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases and not to solar forcing or the recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.

We show that the relationship that links Sahel rainfall anomalies to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies at interannual time scales in observations is reproduced by most models, independently of the change in the basic state as the world warms. \n\nThe same SST/Sahel relationship can be used to predict the simulated 20th century changes in Sahel rainfall from each model's simulation of changes in Indo-Pacific SST and Atlantic SST meridional gradient, although the prediction overestimates the simulated trends. Conversely, such a relationship does not explain the rainfall trend in the 21st century in a majority of models.    These results are consistent with there being, in most models, a substantial direct positive effect of atmospheric greenhouse gases on Sahel rainfall, not mediated through SST.\n\n",

Of the 22 models analysed 18 produce a transmission signal; eight through both pathways (EP+NP), eight through the EP route only, and two show limited transmissions to WA. Overall, four models fail to simulate transmission through either pathway. The amplitude of the model ENSO controls the strength of the transmission. The meridional extent of the model ENSO determines whether NP Rossby waves are involved. Since most models produce an ENSO anomaly pattern that is too narrow and too equatorially confined, the importance of the NP pathway is underestimated. This model deficiency needs to be alleviated.",

Annual Antarctic snowfall accumulation trends in the GCMs agree with observations during 1960-1999, and the sensitivity of snowfall accumulation to near-surface air temperature fluctuations is approximately the same as observed, about 5 %/K , suggesting that if Antarctic temperatures rise as projected, snowfall increases may partially offset ice sheet mass loss by mitigating an additional 1 mm/y of global sea level rise by 2100. However, 20th century annual Antarctic near-surface air temperature trends in the GCMs are about 2.5-to-5 times larger-than-observed, raising questions about the robustness of the 21st century projections. Resolving the relative contributions of dynamic and radiative forcing on Antarctic temperature variability will be an important step toward improving GCM projections. ",

            "abstract": "The coupled climate models used in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change are evaluated. The evaluation is focused on 12 regions of Australia for the daily simulation\nof precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature. The evaluation is based on probability\ndensity functions and a simple quantitative measure of how well each climate model can capture the\nobserved probability density functions for each variable and each region is introduced. Across all three\nvariables, the coupled climate models perform better than expected. Precipitation is simulated reasonably\nby most and very well by a small number of models, although the problem with excessive drizzle is apparent\nin most models. Averaged over Australia, 3 of the 14 climate models capture more than 80% of the\nobserved probability density functions for precipitation. Minimum temperature is simulated well, with 10 of\nthe 13 climate models capturing more than 80% of the observed probability density functions. Maximum\ntemperature is also reasonably simulated with 6 of 10 climate models capturing more than 80% of the\nobserved probability density functions. An overall ranking of the climate models, for each of precipitation,\nmaximum, and minimum temperatures, and averaged over these three variables, is presented. Those climate\nmodels that are skillful over Australia are identified, providing guidance on those climate models that\nshould be used in impacts assessments where those impacts are based on precipitation or temperature.\nThese results have no bearing on how well these models work elsewhere, but the methodology is potentially\nuseful in assessing which of the many climate models should be used by impacts groups.",

Some regional assessments have omitted\nmodels based on specific criteria. We use a criteria based on the capacity of climate\nmodels to simulate the observed probability density function calculated using daily\ndata, model-by-model and region-by-region for each of the AR4 models over\nAustralia. We demonstrate that by omitting those climate models with relatively weak\nskill in simulating the observed probability density function of maximum and\nminimum temperature and precipitation difference, regional projections are obtained.\nOnce relatively weak models are omitted, the projected increase in mean maximum\nand mean minimum temperatures increase, but the change in the annual maximum\nand minimum temperatures is lower amongst the better models. There is little impact\non mean precipitation but the better models simulate a larger increase in the annual\nrainfall event combined with a large decrease in the number of rain days. We\ntherefore show that omitting weaker models based on a quantitative skill score\nderived using 20th Century observations provides a means to reduce uncertainty in\nclimate model projections. Since the weaker models appear to bias the amount of\nmean warming towards lower increases, bias annual maximum temperatures to\nexcessive warming and bias precipitation such that the amount of the annual rainfall\nevent is under-estimated we suggest that our approach would lead to improved\nregional scale estimates of future climate change.",

These models contribute to the fourth assessment report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4) in 2007. Our study aids the development of rainfall simulations for a geographical region that is characterized by important dynamic ocean/atmosphere processes and challenging to be represented accurately by climate models. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) analysis and seasonal climatology anomalies show that most models are better at simulating rainfall over northern Australia than the Indonesian maritime region, particularly during Austral winter and spring. The representation of seasonal rainfall remains problematic during Austral summer and autumn. We use cumulative absolute differences to rank the models and the MIUB-ECHO-G model is found to reproduce seasonal rainfall over terrestrial and oceans in the Austral-Indonesian region most accurately. The GISS-EH model is least able to reproduce these rainfall patterns.",

The response of the global-mean troposphere temperature to increasing greenhouse gases is more likely linear, while the amplitude and period of ENSO fluctuates in a multi-decadal time scale. The climate system model outputs suggest that the multi-decadal modulation of ENSO is related to the delayed response of the subsurface temperature in the tropical Pacific compared to the response time of the sea surface temperature (SST), which would lead a modulation of the vertical temperature gradient. Furthermore, an eigen analysis considering only two parameters, the changes in the zonal contrast of the mean background SST and the changes in the vertical contrast between the mean surface and subsurface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, exhibits a good agreement with the CGCM outputs in terms of the multi-decadal modulations of the ENSO\u2019s amplitude and period. In particular, the change in the vertical contrast, i.e., change in difference between the subsurface temperature and SST, turns out to be more influential on the ENSO modulation than changes in the mean SST itself.",

In this study, sixteen CGCM simulations of the response of the climate system to a 1\\% per year increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration to quadrupling are analysed with focus on Northern Hemisphere winter. A common signal in fourteen out of sixteen simulations is an increased or unchanged stationary wave amplitude.\n\nA majority of the simulations may be categorised into one of three groups based on the GHG induced changes in the atmospheric stationary waves. The response of the zonal mean barotropic wind is similar within each group. 50% of the simulations belong to the first group which is categorised by a stationary wave with five waves encompassing the whole NH and a strengthening of the zonal mean barotropic wind. The second and third group, consisting of three and two simulations respectively, are characterised by a broadening and a northward shift of the zonal mean barotropic wind respectively. A linear model of barotropic vorticity is employed to study the importance of these mean flow changes to the stationary wave response. The linear calculations indicate that the GHG induced mean wind changes explain 50%, 4% and 37% of the stationary wave changes in each group respectively. Thus, for the majority of simulations the zonal mean wind changes do significantly explain the stationary wave response.\n",

            "abstract": "Effective climate sensitivity is often assumed to be constant, but previous studies of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations have found it varying as the simulation progresses. This complicates the fitting of simple models to such simulations, as well as having implications for the estimation of climate sensitivity from observations. This study examines the evolution of the feedbacks determining the climate sensitivity in GCMs submitted to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project.  Apparent centennial timescale variations of climate sensitivity during stabilisation to a forcing can be considered an artifact of using conventional forcings, allowing only for instantaneous effects and stratosphere-adjustment. If the forcing is adjusted for processes occurring on timescales which are short compared to the climate stabilisation timescale then there is little centennial timescale evolution of climate sensitivity in any of the GCMs.  We suggest that much of the apparent variation in climate sensitivity identified in previous studies is actually due to the comparatively fast forcing adjustment. Persistent differences are found in the strength of the feedbacks between the coupled atmosphere--ocean (AO) versions and their atmosphere-mixed-layer ocean (AML) counterparts, (the latter are often assumed to give the climate sensitivity of the AOGCM). This indicates that the response of the dynamic ocean influences the atmospheric feedbacks in some GCMs and that the AML model may not provide a good estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity for the parallel AO version. The adjustment to the forcing to account for comparatively fast processes varies in magnitude and sign between GCMs, as well as differing between AO and AML versions of the same model. There is evidence from one AOGCM that the forcing adjustment may take a couple of decades, with implications for observationally based estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity.  We suggest that at least some of the spread in 21st century global temperature predictions between GCMs is due to differing adjustment processes, hence work to understand these differences should be a priority.",

Three ocean convection sites are simulated, in the Labrador, Irminger and Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas in agreement with observations. A mechanism linking the variability of the Arctic sea ice cover and convection in the GIN Seas is highlighted. Contrary to previous suggested mechanisms, in CNRM-CM3 the latter is not modulated by the variability of freshwater export through Fram Strait. Instead, the variability of convection is mainly driven by the variability of the sea ice edge position in the Greenland Sea. In this area, the surface freshwater balance is dominated by the freshwater input due to the melting of sea ice. The ice edge position is modulated either by northwestward geostrophic current anomalies or by an intensification of northerly winds. In the model, stronger than average northerly winds force simultaneous intense convective events in the Irminger and GIN Seas. Convection interacts with the thermohaline circulation on timescales of 5\u201310 years, which translates into MOC anomalies propagating southward from the convection sites.",

The third version of the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches M\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques) global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model (CNRM-CM3) was used to conduct climate change experiments for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). The analysis of the A1B scenario experiment shows that global warming leads to a slowdown of North Atlantic deep ocean convection and thermohaline circulation south of Iceland. This slowdown is triggered by a freshening of the Arctic Ocean and an increase in freshwater outflow through Fram Strait. Sea ice melting in the Barents Sea induces a local amplification of the surface warming, which enhances the cyclonic atmospheric circulation around Spitzberg. This anti-clockwise circulation forces an increase in Fram Strait outflow and a simultaneous increase in ocean transport of warm waters toward the Barents Sea, favouring further sea ice melting and surface warming in the Barents Sea. Additionally, the retreat of sea ice allows more deep water formation north of Iceland and the thermohaline circulation strengthens there. The transport of warm and saline waters toward the Barents Sea is further enhanced, which constitutes a second positive feedback.",

Strong annual peaks may therefore be seen as an indication for\nocean forced decadal SST variability in the extra-tropics.",

            "abstract": "It is shown that some important aspects of the space-time structure of multidecadal sea surface temperature (SST) variability can be explained by local air-sea interactions. A concept for \u201cGlobal Hyper Climate Modes\u201d is formulated: surface heat flux variability associated with regional atmospheric variability patterns is integrated by the large heat capacity of the extra-tropical oceans, leading to a continuous increase of SST variance towards longer timescales. Atmospheric teleconnections spread the extra-tropical signal to the tropical regions. Once SST anomalies have developed in the Tropics, global atmospheric teleconnections spread the signal around the world creating a global hyper climate mode. A simple model suggests that hyper climate modes can vary on timescales longer than 1,000 years. Ocean dynamics may amplify theses modes and influence the regional expression of the variability, but are not at the heart of the mechanism which produces the hyper modes.",

As in previous model generations, considerable differences in the simulated global mean radiation budgets are also found in the IPCC-AR4 models, particularly in the atmosphere and at the surface. We use a comprehensive set of surface observations to constrain these uncertainties, and focus on the downward shortwave and longwave radiation which can directly be validated against the surface observations. The majority of the IPCC-AR4 models still shows a tendency to overestimate the shortwave and underestimate the longwave downward radiation, each by 6 Wm-2 on average, a long standing problem in many GCMs. A subset of models, however, is now capable of simulating at least one of the downward radiative fluxes with no systematic bias. Model biases in all-sky and clear-sky fluxes are often similar, suggesting that deficiencies in clear-sky radiative transfer calculations are major contributors to the excessive surface insolation in many of the models. No indication is found that the simulated excessive surface insolation is due to missing cloud absorption. \n\n\n\n \n",

Here, the leading principal components of the sea level pressure field and local specific humidity are co-variates of the distribution parameters. The GEV parameters are estimated using data from 1949-1999 and the r-largest method. This statistical downscaling procedure is found to yield skill over the southern and northern West Coast, central USA and areas of western and eastern Canada when tested with independent data.\nThe projected changes in co-variates or predictors are obtained from transient climate change simulations conducted with the CGCM3.1 model of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, forced by the IPCC A2 forcing scenario. They are then used to derive the GEV distribution parameters for the period 2050-2099. The projected frequency of the current 20-year return maximum daily precipitation for that period suggests that extreme precipitation risk will increase heavily over the south and central US but decrease over the Canadian Prairies. The difference between the statistical downscaling results and those estimated using GCM simulation is also discussed.\n",

            "abstract": "This study assesses the detectability of external influences in changes of precipitation extremes in the 20th century, which is explored through a perfect model analysis with an ensemble of coupled climate model simulations. Three indices of precipitation extremes are defined from the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution: the 20-yr return value (P20), the median (Pm), and the cumulative probability density as a probability-based index (PI). Time variations of area-averages of these three extreme indices are analyzed over different spatial domains from the globe to continental regions. Treating all forcing simulations (ALL; natural plus anthropogenic) of the 20th century as observations and using a preindustrial control run (CTL) to estimate the internal variability, the amplitudes of response patterns to anthropogenic (ANT), natural (NAT), greenhouse-gases (GHG), and sulfate aerosols (SUL) forcings are estimated using a Bayesian decision method.\n\nResults show that there are decisively detectable ANT signals in global, hemispheric, and zonal band areas. When only land is considered, the global and hemispheric detection results are unchanged, but detectable ANT signals in the zonal bands are limited to low latitudes. The ANT signals are also detectable in the Pm and PI but not in P20 at continental scales over Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia. This indicates that indices located near the center of the GEV distribution (Pm and PI) may give better signal-to-noise ratio than indices representing the tail of the distribution (P20). GHG and NAT signals are also detectable, but less robustly for more limited extreme indices and regions. These results are largely insensitive when model data are masked to mimic the availability of the observed data. An imperfect model analysis in which fingerprints are obtained from simulations with a different GCM suggests that ANT is robustly detectable only at global and hemispheric scales, with high uncertainty in the zonal and continental results.",

Other\nmodels capture one or two of these variables well but show limitations, or could not be assessed, in a third. We, therefore,\nrecommend these three models to users of model results, but note that this recommendation is limited to this basin. However,\nour methodology provides quite a straightforward and quantitatively based means to choose climate models for impact\nassessment in any data-rich region.

Among, the models analyzed, the HadCM3 simulates the summer and spring circulation close to its observed, despite of locate the Bolivian High (BA) and the Chaco low (CL) shifted for the southwest of its climatological positions.  On the other hand, for future scenarios the BA is shifted to west, and the CL is stronger and extends its over center of Brazil, generating underestimates the precipitation on the Amazonia.  The GFDL model simulates better the precipitations in fall, over the north of the northeast Brazil. The subtropical highs of the north and south hemisphere show an adequate position to the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone - ITZC (over 5\u00b0S).  For future scenarios, this model does not change its circulation pattern, and in the last climatology (2071-2100), it generates positive anomalies over the north of the Amazonia.  The GISS model simulates a summer and spring circulation far from its observed in the present climate. However, for the 2071-2100 future scenarios simulates a lot rain over the Amazonia.\n\n",

The analysis is confined to the marine subtropics in an attempt to isolate low cloudiness from tropical convective systems. \n\nAll analyzed models have a negative bias in the low cloud fraction (model mean bias of  &#8722;15%). On the other hand, the models show an excess of cloud radiative cooling in the region (model mean excess of 13 W m&#8722;2). The latter bias is shown to mainly originate from too much shortwave reflection by the models clouds rather than biases in the clear-sky fluxes. These results confirm earlier studies, thus no major progress in simulating the marine subtropical clouds is noted. As a consequence of the combination of these two biases, this study suggests that all investigated models are likely to overestimate the radiative response to changes in low level subtropical cloudiness.",

            "abstract": "Similarities and differences between El Nino and global warming are examined in hemispherical and zonal tropical precipitation changes of the ECHAM5/MIP_MO simulations. Similarities include hemispherical asymmetry of tropical precipitation changes. This precipitation asymmetry varies with season. In the boreal summer and fall (winter and spring), positive precipitation anomalies are found over the northern (southern) hemisphere and negative precipitation anomalies are found over the southern (northern) hemisphere. This precipitation asymmetry in both the El Nino and global warming cases is associated with the seasonal migration of the Hadley circulation. However, their causes are different. In El Nino, a meridional moisture gradient between convective and subsidence regions is the fundamental basis for inducing the asymmetry. Over the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation, convection is enhanced by less effective static stability. Over margins of the ascending branch, convection is suppressed by the import of dry air from the descending branch. In global warming, low-level moisture is enhanced significantly due to warmer tropospheric temperature. This enhances vertical moisture transport over the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation, so convection is strengthened. Over the descending branch, the mean Hadley circulation tends to transport relatively drier air downward, so convection is reduced.",

            "abstract": "By analyzing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections, we find  a physically solid rationale for expecting that Atlantic tropical cyclone activity could gradually decrease over the 21st century. When the tropical North Atlantic is cool (warm) and the Atlantic warm pool is small (large), both the vertical wind shear and the moist static stability over the main development region (MDR) for hurricanes increase (decrease) while tropical cyclone activity decreases (increases). From the IPCC multi-model data set, we find that the North Atlantic warms more slowly than other oceans as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) decreases, whence a physically consistent scenario, confirmed by IPCC projections, suggests that the atmosphere should respond as if to a small (cool) warm pool and the vertical wind shear and the moist static stability over the MDR should increase, causing tropical cyclone activity to decrease.

            "abstract": "In this study, we present climate change projections based on the results from 23 climate model simulations performed for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report. Statistical methods are used to test how well each model simulated observed average (1961-1990) patterns of mean sea-level pressure, temperature and rainfall over the Australian region. The 15 models with the highest pattern correlations and smallest rms errors are identified. The 21st century simulations are driven by the IPCC \u2018SRES\u2019 greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenarios. Using the 15 best climate models, annual and seasonal average projections of Australian rainfall and temperature change are derived for various decades. Results are highlighted for 2030 and 2070 for comparison with projections published by CSIRO in 2001. The projections are expressed as ranges,\nincorporating uncertainty in both global warming and regional differences between climate simulations over Australia.\n\nInland regions show greater warming, compared to coastal regions. There are large decreases in the number of days below 0\u00b0C and large increases in the number of days above 35\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. Rainfall changes are more complex than temperature changes. Although increases and decreases in rainfall are projected in the future, decreases dominate the overall pattern, especially in the south in winter and spring.\n\nCSIRO\u2019s earlier projections, based on nine climate models, appear robust when compared with the updated projections. The patterns and magnitudes of warming are similar, although the updated projections have slightly less warming in coastal regions. The pattern of rainfall change is also similar, particularly the strong decrease in winter and spring over southern Australia, but the updated projections give a more widespread tendency for increases in summer in eastern Australia and a clearer tendency for decreases in autumn in Queensland and the eastern Northern Territory.

Both indices show a reasonable global number and spatial distribution of implied tropical cyclones compared to observations.\n\nUsing the same approach, we evaluate tropical cyclone activity in the last 20 year period of the 20th century in an ensemble of nine Coupled Global Climate Model simulations submitted to the IPCC AR4.  We extend this analysis backwards in time, through the 20th century, and find the ensemble derived CYGP suggests no trend in inferred TC numbers while the YGP, after applying a correction to compensate for its oversensitivity to sea surface temperature, suggests a small upward trend. Both indices give a fair geographical distribution of cyclogenesis. Finally, we assess future tropical cyclone trends using 3 emission scenarios. Using the CYGP, which appears the most robust index for application to climate change, a small increase is predicted in the North-Western Pacific in the A1B and A2 scenarios.",

To evaluate this approach, we investigate the relationship between inter-model similarity in patterns of current regional climate and inter-model similarity in patterns of regional enhanced greenhouse response using data from a multi-model database. Correlations of moderate magnitude are common, indicating the value of testing the current regional climate simulation of models. Notably, relationships vary significantly regionally (e.g., are weakest in the tropics), cross variables (e.g., current climate mean sea level pressure is related to temperature and precipitation change in some extra-tropical regions) and can be insensitive to whether the current climate is assessed in the region concerned or globally. The concept demonstrated here can provide a basis for evaluating and weighting models for use in preparing projections of regional climate change.",

Here, we show how both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods applied to relatively coarse-scale atmosphere-ocean general circulation model output are able to improve simulation of spatial and temporal variability in temperature and precipitation across the region. We then develop high-resolution projections of future climate change across the northeast USA, using IPCC SRES emission scenarios combined with these downscaling methods. The projections show increases in temperature that are larger at higher latitudes and inland, as well as the potential for changing precipitation patterns, particularly along the coast. While the absolute magnitude of change expected over the coming century depends on the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing, significantly higher increases in temperature and in winter precipitation are expected under a higher as compared to lower scenario of future emissions from human activities.",

The hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), an invasive insect introduced to eastern North America from Japan, has decimated stands of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina hemlock (T. caroliniana) from Georgia to Connecticut. However, its spread across central and northern New England has been slowed substantially by its inability to tolerate cold winter temperatures. Using data from previous lab and field studies collected over the past 17 years, including adelgid spread and overwintering mortality, we first characterize the temperature conditions that may limit adelgid spread. We then show how, in the future, rising winter temperatures due to climate change are likely to remove the conditions currently limiting adelgid spread, and facilitate the northward expansion as more suitable habitat becomes available.",

            "abstract": "Most prior climate change assessments for U.S. agriculture have focused on major world food crops such as wheat and maize. While useful from a national and global perspective, these results are not particularly relevant to the Northeastern U.S. agriculture economy, which is dominated by dairy milk production, and high-value horticultural crops such as apples (Malus domestica), grapes (Vitis vinifera), sweet corn (Zea mays var. rugosa), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), and maple syrup (sugar maple, Acer saccharum). We used statistically downscaled climate projections generated by the HadCM3 atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation model, run with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change future emissions scenarios A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower), to evaluate several climate thresholds of direct relevance to agriculture in the region. A longer (frost-free) growing season could create new opportunities for farmers with enough capital to take risks on new crops (assuming a market for new crops can be developed). However, our results indicate that many crops will have yield losses associated with increased frequency of high temperature stress, inadequate winter chill period for optimum fruiting in spring, increased pressure from marginally over-wintering and/or invasive weeds, insects, or disease, or other factors. Weeds are likely to benefit more than cash crops from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Projections of thermal heat index values for dairy cows indicate a substantial potential negative impact on milk production. At the higher compared to lower emissions scenario, negative climate change effects will occur sooner, and impact a larger geographic area within the region. Farmer adaptations to climate change will not be cost- or risk-free, and the impact on individual farm families and rural communities will depend on commodity produced, available capital, and timely, accurate climate projections.",

The air quality calculations were done with both a global chemistry-transport model and a regional air quality model focused on the northeast USA. The air quality simulations assumed no changes in regional anthropogenic emissions of the chemical species primarily involved in the chemical reactions of ozone creation and destruction, but only accounted for changes in the climate. Together, these idealized global and regional model simulations provide insights into the contribution of possible future climate changes on ozone. Over the coming century, summer climate is projected to be warmer and less cloudy for the northeast USA. These changes are considerably larger under the higher scenario as compared with the lower. Higher temperatures also increase biogenic emissions. Both mean daily and 8-h maximum ozone increase from the combination of three factors that tend to favor higher concentrations: (1) higher temperatures change the rates of reactions and photolysis rates important to the ozone chemistry; (2) lower cloudiness (higher solar radiation) increases the photolysis reaction rates; and (3) higher biogenic emissions increase the concentration of reactive species. Regional model simulations with two cumulus parameterizations produce ozone concentration changes that differ by approximately 10%, indicating that there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of changes due to uncertainties in how physical processes should be parameterized in the models. However, the overall effect of the climate changes simulated by these models \u2013 in the absence of reductions in regional anthropogenic emissions \u2013 would be to increase ozone concentrations.",

            "abstract": "With dense population and development along its coastline, the northeastern United States is, at present, highly vulnerable to coastal flooding. At five sea level stations in the United States, from Massachusetts to New Jersey, sea level rise (SLR) trends and tidal effects were removed from the hourly sea level time series and then frequency analysis was performed on the positive remaining anomalies that represent storm surge heights. Then using eustatic SLR estimates for lower and higher greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and assumed trends in local sea level rise, new recurrence intervals were determined for future storm surges. Under the higher emissions scenario, by 2050, the elevation of the 2005 100-year event may be equaled or exceeded at least every 30 years at all sites. In more exposed US cities such as Boston, Massachusetts and Atlantic City, New Jersey, this could occur at the considerably higher frequency of every 8 years or less. Under the lower emissions scenario, by 2050, the elevation of the 2005 100-year event may be equaled or exceeded at least every 70 years at all sites. In Boston and Atlantic City, this could occur every 30 years or less.",

            "abstract": "Winter recreation is an important part of the cultural identity of the Northeast United States and is a multibillion dollar contributor to the regional economy. This study examined the vulnerability of the two largest winter recreation industries, snowmobiling and alpine skiing, to four climate change scenarios for the twenty-first century. Under all scenarios, natural snow became an increasingly scarce resource. The diminished natural snow pack had a very negative impact on the snowmobile industry. As early as 2010\u20132039, 4 to 6 of the 15 snowmobile study areas were projected to lose more than half of the current season. Reliable snowmobile seasons (>50 days) were virtually eliminated in the region under the A1Fi scenarios by 2070\u20132099. The large investment in snowmaking substantially reduced the vulnerability of the ski industry and climate change posed a risk to only 4 of the 14 ski areas in 2010\u20132039, where average ski seasons declined below 100 days and the probability of being open for the entire Christmas\u2013New Year\u2019s holiday declined below 75%. Conversely, by 2070\u20132099 only four ski study areas had not reached these same economic risk criteria. In order to minimize ski season losses, snowmaking requirements are projected to increase substantially, raising important uncertainties about water availability and cost. Climate change represents a notable threat to the winter recreation sector in the Northeast, and the potential economic ramifications for businesses and communities heavily invested in winter tourism and related real estate is sizeable.",

The consequences of future pathways of greenhouse gas emissions on projected climate and impacts across climate-sensitive sectors is assessed by using downscaled projections from three global climate models under both higher (Alfi) and lower (B1) emissions scenarios. The findings illustrate that near-term reductions in emissions can greatly reduce the extent and severity of regionally important impacts on natural and managed ecosystems and public health in the latter half of this century, and increase the feasibility that those impacts which are now unavoidable can be successfully managed through adaptation.",

            "abstract": "An increase in the rate of sea-level rise and potential changes in storminess represent important components of global climate change that will likely affect the extensive coasts of the Northeastern USA. Raising sea level not only increases the likelihood of coastal flooding, but changes the template for waves and tides to sculpt the coast, which can lead to land loss orders of magnitude greater than that from direct inundation alone. There is little question that sea-level rise, and in particular an increased rate of rise, will result in permanent losses of coastal land. However, quantitative predictions of these future coastal change remains difficult due in part to the complexity of coastal systems and the influence of infrequent storm events, and is further confounded by coastal science\u2019s insufficient understanding of the behavior of coastal systems over decadal timescales. Recently, dramatic improvements in technology have greatly improved our capabilities to investigate and characterize processes and sedimentary deposits in the coastal zone, allowing us, for the first time, to address some of the over-arching problems involved in shoreline change. Despite advances in many areas of coastal geology, our fundamental understanding of shoreline change has been limited by a lack of a broad and integrated scientific focus, a lack of resources, and a lack of willingness on the part of policymakers who make crucial decisions about human activity along the coast to support basic research in this area. Although quantitative predictions remain constrained, there remains little doubt that the predicted climates changes will have profound effects upon the Northeastern coast.",

We modeled and mapped each species individually and show current and potential future distributions for two emission scenarios (A1fi [higher emission] and B1 [lower emission]) and three climate models: the Parallel Climate, the Hadley CM3, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in this region, especially under a high emissions trajectory. Results indicate that while species with potentially increasing areas of suitable habitat in the Northeastern US substantially outnumber those with decreasing areas of habitat, there are key species that show diminishing habitat area: balsam fir (Abies balsamea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), red spruce (Picea rubens), bigtooth and quaking aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. tremuloides), and black cherry (Prunus serotina). From these results we identified the top 10 losers and gainers for each US state in the region by scenario and emissions trajectory. By combining individual species importance maps and developing assembly rules for various classes, we created maps of potential forest types for the Northeast showing a general loss of the spruce\u2013fir zone with advancing oak\u2013hickory type.

            "abstract": "We examined the potential impacts of future climate change on the distribution and production of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the northeastern USA\u2019s continental shelf. We began by examining the response of cod to bottom water temperature changes observed over the past four decades using fishery-independent resource survey data. After accounting for the overall decline in cod during this period, we show that the probability of catching cod at specified locations decreased markedly with increasing bottom temperature. Our analysis of future changes in water temperature was based on output from three coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation models under high and low CO2 emissions. An increase of <1.5\u00b0C is predicted for all sectors under the low emission scenario in spring and autumn by the end of this century. Under the high emission scenario, temperature increases range from &#8764;2\u00b0C in the north to >3.5\u00b0C in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Under these conditions, cod appear vulnerable to a loss of thermal habitat on Georges Bank, with a substantial loss of thermal habitat farther south. We also examined temperature effects on cod recruitment and growth in one stock area, the Gulf of Maine, to explore potential implications for yield and resilience to fishing. Cod survival during the early life stages declined with increasing water temperatures, offsetting potential increases in growth with warmer temperatures and resulting in a predicted loss in yield and increased vulnerability to high fishing mortality rates. Substantial differential impacts under the low versus high emission scenarios are evident for cod off the northeastern USA.",

            "abstract": "Forest ecosystems represent the dominant form of land cover in the northeastern United States and are heavily relied upon by the region\u2019s residents as a source of fuel, fiber, structural materials, clean water, economic vitality, and recreational opportunities. Although predicted changes in climate have important implications for a number of ecosystem processes, our present understanding of their long-term effects is poor. In this study, we used the PnET-CN model of forest carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water cycling to evaluate the effects of predicted changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on forest growth, C exchange, water runoff, and nitrate ($$ {\\text{NO}}^{ - }_{3} $$) leaching at five forest research sites across the northeastern U.S. We used four sets of statistically downscaled climate predictions from two general circulation models (the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and the Parallel Climate Model) and two scenarios of future CO2 concentrations. A series of model experiments was conducted to examine the effects of future temperature, precipitation, CO2, and various assumptions regarding the physiological response of forests to these changes. Results indicate a wide range of predicted future growth rates. Increased growth was predicted across deciduous sites under most future conditions, while growth declines were predicted for spruce forests under the warmest scenarios and in some deciduous forests when CO2 fertilization effects were absent. Both climate and rising CO2 contributed to predicted changes, but their relative importance shifted from CO2-dominated to climate-dominated from the first to second half of the twenty-first century. Predicted runoff ranged from no change to a slight decrease, depending on future precipitation and assumptions about stomatal response to CO2. Nitrate leaching exhibited variable responses, but was highest under conditions that imposed plant stress with no physiological effects of CO2. Although there are considerable uncertainties surrounding predicted responses to climate change, these results provide a range of possible outcomes and highlight interactions among processes that are likely to be important. Such information can be useful to scientists and land managers as they plan on means of examining and responding to the effects of climate change.",

            "abstract": "We used three approaches to assess potential effects of climate change on birds of the Northeast. First, we created distribution and abundance models for common bird species using climate, elevation, and tree species variables and modeled how bird distributions might change as habitats shift. Second, we assessed potential effects on high-elevation birds, especially Bicknell\u2019s thrush (Catharus bicknelli), that may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, by using statistical associations between climate, spruce-fir forest vegetation and bird survey data. Last, we complemented these projections with an assessment of how habitat quality of a migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) might be affected by climate change. Large changes in bird communities of the Northeast are likely to result from climate change, and these changes will be most dramatic under a scenario of continued high emissions. Indeed, high-elevation bird species may currently be at the threshold of critical change with as little as 1\u00b0C warming reducing suitable habitat by more than half. Species at mid elevations are likely to experience declines in habitat quality that could affect demography. Although not all species will be affected adversely, some of the Northeast\u2019s iconic species, such as common loon and black-capped chickadee, and some of its most abundant species, including several neotropical migrants, are projected to decline significantly in abundance under all climate change scenarios. No clear mitigation strategies are apparent, as shifts in species\u2019 abundances and ranges will occur across all habitat types and for species with widely differing ecologies.",
