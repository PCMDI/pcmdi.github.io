<p>Under the AMIP subproject 26 we analyzed the monthly precipitation in
AMIP runs of 31 GCMs (Gadgil and Sajani 1998a,b). We find that while most
of the models simulate the&nbsp; seasonal migration of the primary rainbelt
over the African region and the&nbsp; rainfall patterns associated with
the African monsoon in austral and&nbsp; boreal summers, the seasonal variation
over the Asia-West Pacific region&nbsp; and&nbsp; the seasonal mean pattern
over the Indian monsoon zone is realistically simulated only by some models.

<p>In the AMIP decade there were large fluctuations of the Indian summer
monsoon with the droughts of 1982 and 1987&nbsp; being associated with
a warm event (El Nino) in the Pacific and the excess monsoon season of
1988 with a cold event. We expect best results for the simulation of these
three events in the AMIP runs because they were associated with large SST
anomalies which were used as boundary conditions in the AMIP runs. Yet
only five&nbsp; models were able to simulate anomalies of significant amplitude
and the correct sign, while another six simulated the correct signs but
not the amplitudes of the anomalies of these three events.

<p>We find that, on the whole, models which simulate the seasonal migration
of the primary rainbelt over the Asia-West Pacific region realistically
have a greater propensity for the simulation of the mean rainfall pattern
over the Indian monsoon zone as well as the simulation of the interannual
variation associated with ENSO. If analysis of the AMIP II runs support
this hypothesis, then in the strategy for improvement of the simulation
of the Indian monsoon rainfall and its interannual variation the&nbsp;
focus should be on better simulation of this large-scale feature.

<p>The additional years included in AMIP II are of particular interest
in understanding the interannual variation of the Indian monsoon and its
teleconnections with events over the Pacific. Whereas each El Nino event
in the first AMIP decade was associated with a deficient monsoon (although
the converse was not true!), despite the occurrence of El Nino warmings
of 1992, 93 and 94 no deficient monsoon seasons occurred after 1987. It
is possible that the dominating influence of the Pacific SSTs found for
the earlier period (Palmer et al. 1992) may have become less significant
in the last few years. Whether SSTs over other oceans or atmospheric factors
have become more important need to be investigated. AMIP II with improved
versions of the models, ensemble runs etc. provides a unique opportunity
to understand this and hence assess the potential for prediction of the
interannual variation of the Indian monsoon.

<p>The interannual variation of the Indian monsoon between good and poor
monsoons is linked to the intraseasonal variation between active and weak
spells or breaks over the monsoon zone (Krishnamurti and Bhalme 1976, Gadgil
1988). The intraseasonal variation over&nbsp; monsoonal regions comprises
such fluctuations between active/weak spells and, over the Indian longitudes
poleward propagations of the rainbelt (Sikka and Gadgil 1980, Gadgil and
Srinivasan 1990,&nbsp; Gadgil and Asha 1992 , Srinivasan and Smith 1996).
Mechanisms proposed so far involve variation in the stability of the atmosphere
and surface hydrological feedbacks (Krishnamurti and Bhalme 1976, Webster
1983, Nanjundiah et al. 1992, Srinivasan et al. 1993). Analysis of the
simulated variation of the relevent variables&nbsp; should provide insight
into the underlying mechanisms.

<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Analysis&nbsp; of the simulation of monthly fields of precipitation and
circulation and observations&nbsp; to assess the skill of simulation of
the mean seasonal rainfall pattern and the interannual variation during
AMIP II period in monsoonal regions</li>

<li>
to test the hypothesis suggested by our analysis of AMIP I runs (Gadgil
et al. 1997) viz that the propensity of a realistic simulation of the mean
seasonal rainfall pattern over the Indian monsoon zone and its interannual
variation is greater for the class of models which simulate the seasonal
variation over the Asia-West Pacific sector (70-140E) realistically</li>

<li>
further diagnostic studies to understand the observed change of the teleconnection
between the interannual variation of the Indian monsoon and ENSO during
the AMIP I decade (1979-88) and the period 1989-95 in AMIP II.</li>
</ol>
<a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>

<p>The dataset comprising monthly precipitation at all meteorological observatories
in India during 1901-90, obtained from the India Meteorological Department
analysed earlier (Gadgil et al. 1993) will be extended to cover the AMIP
II period. For analysis of satellite derived convection an objective method
developed for delineation of TCZ from the daily OLR-albedo data (Gadgil
and Guruprasad 1990) will be used. These indices of convection along with
HRC (for 1979-87), OLR from NOAA (for 1979-86), ERBE (available for the
period 1985-89) and MSU (for 1979-93) will be compared to model simulated
precipitation as in the AMIP I subproject 26.

<p>Since, besides the subproject proposed here, there are two monsoon subprojects
(No. 6, 25), we will ensure that duplication of effort is avoided by collaboration
and exchange of results.
