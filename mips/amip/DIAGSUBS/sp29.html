<p>Many of the techniques used to diagnose climatic variability (empirical
orthogonal functions, teleconnections, regression analysis, singular value
decomposition etc.) are formulated using methods taken from linear analysis.
Whilst these techniques can be legitimately applied to the nonlinear climate
system, by virtue of their linear formulation, it is difficult to use them
to analyze the nonlinear structure of the climate attractor.
<p>There are indications that it may be important to understand the nonlinear
structure of the climate attractor in order to understand recent climate
change. For example, there is evidence that changes in northern-hemisphere
climate in recent decades can be explained in terms of changes in the frequency
of occurrence of preferred nonlinear naturally-occurring atmospheric circulation
regimes (Palmer, 1998; Corti et al., 1998).
<p>If this is so, then it is essential that global climate models (GCMs)
be able to simulate accurately the observed atmospheric circulation regimes,
even though the dominant intraseasonal timescale of regime fluctuations
is much shorter than the decadal timescale of the climate change signal
itself. More generally, GCMs should be able to simulate the non-gaussian
structure of the climate attractor. As yet, only a few tests have been
performed on GCMs to assess this component of their behavior (e.g. Molteni
and Tibaldi, 1990; Haines and Hannachi, 1995; Hannachi, 1997, Tett et al.,
1997).
<p>In this proposal we introduce a diagnostic package which we hope will
become a standard tool for the assessment of circulation regimes and associated
nonlinear structure, both from GCM simulations, and from (re)analysis datasets.
We propose to apply this package to the set of AMIP-II integrations.
<p><a name="Objectives"></a><font size=+1>Objectives</font>
<p>The objectives of the intended research is to investigate:
<p>a) Whether the climate attractors (expressed as probability density
functions -PDFs) of global circulation models have statistically significant
non-gaussian structure, and well defined circulation regimes in particular.
Attention will be focussed on the northern hemisphere winter circulation.
The regime analyses will be performed over the whole hemisphere, and over
the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. The vertical (and hence thermal) structure
of the PDF maxima will also be estimated. Analyses from different models,
and with reanalysis data will be compared
<p>b) The extent to which time-mean differences between models can be explained
in terms of the difference in PDFs associated with dominant regimes will
be explored.
<p>c) The existence of intermittent synchronization between regimes in
the Atlantic and Pacific will be explored. The existence of such intermittent
synchronization may help explain why there appear to be coherent regimes
on the hemispheric scale.
<p>d) To study the differences between regimes defined by quasi-stationarity
on the one hand, and defined by PDF maxima on the other.

<p>Two different techniques are proposed to study nonlinear low frequency
variability (LFV) from both the AMIP-II and from re-analyses.
<p>The first (dynamical) method is based on minimizing the streamfunction
tendency using for example the barotropic vorticity equation (Haines and
Hannachi, 1995) within the phase space spanned by the dominant low frequency
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of the GCMs. It is believed that
this technique ought to be more realistic and computationally cheaper compared
to other approaches (Branstator and Opseegh, 1989, and Anderson, 1992),
since there are fewer degrees of freedom involved and also because the
whole of the chosen phase space, defined by the retained EOFs, can be explored.
Therefore, the method converges towards a few realistic minima within the
model attractor in contrast to the previously mentioned approaches which
always seek a single fixed point state close to some given observed flow.
We also propose at a later stage to diagnose three-dimensional (3D) flow
regimes by extending the previous technique to include the vertical structure
of the model variability as in Hannachi (1997). This is of particular interest
if we want to relate the vertical structure of the regimes to satellite
radiance observations (Christy and McNider, 1994, Hurrel and Trenberth,
1996, and Corti et al. 1998).
<p>Local and also global analyses will be performed. Specifically, we propose
to&nbsp; perform analyses over the North Atlantic and North Pacific sectors
as well as over the whole northern hemisphere. This will enable us in particular
to link local regimes to `planetary' regimes and to study the `intermittent'
synchronisation mentioned earlier.
<p>Next, the model attractors will be investigated to assess how well models
do represent the non-Gaussian behaviour. Each GCM model trajectory obtained
as (filtered) timeseries of the principal components (PCs) of the retained
(LFV) EOFs will be analysed using a mixture analysis (Haines and Hannachi,
1995, Hannachi, 1997) in which the probability distribution of the data
is expressed as a weighted sum (mixture) of Gaussians. Each Gaussian represents
the probability distribution of one regime identified by its centre and
its covariance matrix. The mixture model (Everitt and Hand, 1981) is very
convenient for regime studies and clusters identification (Wolfe, 1970),
especially given the existence of efficient iterative approaches such as
the expectation-maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). This analysis
will also enable us to test whether the model attractor supports non-Gaussian
behaviour.
<p>As before, the analysis will be performed locally over the North Atlantic
and North Pacific sectors and also over the whole northern hemisphere.
Extension to the 3D analyses will be performed at a later stage. Once the
regimes and their probability distributions are identified then we will
be able to do a composite analysis to analyse for the temperature field
pattern corresponding to each regime flow.

<p>We will require in the first instance the timeseries of the NDJFM daily
winter time geopotential height fields at 500 mb.&nbsp; At a later stage
we will require geopotential and temperature fields at a number of levels
in the upper and lower troposphere.
