<hr><a name="background"></a><b>Background</b>
<p>Atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) are used extensively in
making extended weather forecasts, climate predictions, as well as simulating
future climate changes.&nbsp; Due to differences in model physics and numerical
procedures, different GCMs tend to produce differences in atmospheric circulation
patterns.&nbsp; The climatological stationary waves simulated in the GCMs,
for example, can have considerable variation amongst themselves and are
often different from those in observations.&nbsp; The complexity of GCMs
makes it difficult to isolate the causes for the differences among GCMs.&nbsp;
We propose to use simplified models with the AMIP output to study the differences
in the maintenance of stationary waves. The AMIP program provides an ideal
opportunity for the proposed study.
<p>Linear stationary wave models have been powerful tools aiding in the
diagnostic understanding of the maintenance of stationary waves in both
GCMs and observations (e.g., Nigam et al. 1986, 1988; Valdes and Hoskins
1989; Ting, 1994; Wang and Ting, 1999). The linear model allows a separation
of different stationary wave forcings, i.e. diabatic heating, orography
and transient flux convergences.&nbsp; Thus the relative roles of the forcings
in the maintenance of stationary waves can be isolated. For example, Valdes
and Hoskins (1989) studied the northern winter stationary wave maintenance
using the ECMWF analysis while Wang and Ting (1999) examined the stationary
wave maintenance for the entire seasonal cycle using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis.
Both studies found that diabatic heating played the dominant role in stationary
wave maintenance.&nbsp; Given the complexity of the cumulus parameterization
schemes, it is expected that the stationary wave maintenance mechanisms
may be rather different in GCMs.&nbsp; Nigam (1986, 1988) showed that orography
and diabatic heating were of equal importance in the maintenance of northern
winter stationary waves in the GFDL GCM.
<p>In this study, we plan to investigate the stationary wave maintenance
in the AMIP-2 GCMs using a linear and a nonlinear stationary wave model.
Specifically, the relative role of diabatic heating and orography will
be examined.&nbsp; Using a linear model in conjunction with a non-linear
model will help us better understand the role of non-linearity in the maintenance
of stationary waves. Given the availability of the different components
of the diabatic heating, i.e. latent, sensible, and radiative heating in
AMIP-2, we plan to examine the relative importance of the different components
of the heating in the stationary wave maintenance. In most GCMs, latent
heating is further parameterized in terms of moist convective, dry convective
and large-scale precipitation processes. The relative roles of these diabatic
forcings can be further examined in a linear/non-linear model. This should
not only shed light into the roles of these diabatic processes in maintaining
stationary waves, but also provide insight into the importance of the different
parameterizations involved in latent heating in different seasons.
<p><a name="Objectives"></a><b>Objectives</b>
<p>The proposed study will determine:
<ul>
<li>
How well are stationary waves simulated in the various AMIP GCMs</li>

<li>
How are stationary waves maintained in the AMIP GCMs, in particular,</li>

<li>
the relative roles of diabatic heating and orography</li>

<li>
the relative contributions of latent, sensible and radiative heating</li>

<li>
How does different heating parameterization schemes affect the stationary
wave simulation and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<p>We plan to study stationary waves using the linear and non-linear stationary
wave models as tools to examine the maintenance mechanisms of stationary
waves during the different seasons.
<p>The linear model to be used here (Ting and Held, 1990) is one that is
linearized about the zonal-mean climatological flow and is subjected to
the zonally asymmetric forcings. The linear model can be used at a spatial
resolution of R30 or R15 with various vertical resolutions and is described
in Ting (1994). The basic model equations are the prognostic equations
for vorticity, divergence, temperature and log of surface pressure. The
forcings of the linear model include orography, diabatic heating, transients
and stationary nonlinearity.
<p>The non-linear model developed by Ting and Yu (1998) incorporates the
non-linear interaction among the orographic, diabatic and transient forcings
among themselves and with each other. This takes into account the necessary
but unrealistic forcing of stationary non-linearity in the linear model.
A combination of these two models will therefore help us understand the
non-linear stationary wave forcings of orography, diabatic heating and
transients and the different components of latent heating.
<p><a name="Data Requirements"></a><b>Data Requirements</b>
<br>The data required for the study outlined above are as follows:
<p>Upper-air low frequency (monthly mean) output at all 17-levels
<blockquote>1.Northward wind speed
<br>2.Eastward wind speed
<br>3.Vertical motion
<br>4.Air temperature
<br>5.Geopotential height
<br>6.Temperature tendency due to total diabatic heating
<br>7.Temperature tendency due to SW radiation
<br>8.Temperature tendency due to LW radiation
<br>9.Temperature tendency due to moist convective processes
<br>10.Temperature tendency due to dry convective processes
<br>11.Temperature tendency due to large scale precipitation
<br>12.Eddy kinetic energy
<br>13.Mean product of eastward and northward winds
<br>14.Mean product of northward wind and temperature</blockquote>
Single-level low frequency (monthly mean) output
<blockquote>1.Total precipitation
<br>2.OLR
<br>3.Surface pressure</blockquote>
Variable
<p>Model topography
<p>The monthly-mean pressure-surface data are required for constructing
the basic states as well as forcings for the linear and nonlinear models.&nbsp;
Surface pressure data is necessary for converting the pressure level data
to sigma surfaces in the linear and nonlinear models.&nbsp; Total precipitation
and OLR are requested for comparison of AMIP models with observations.&nbsp;
Model topography is a necessary forcing for the stationary wave models.
