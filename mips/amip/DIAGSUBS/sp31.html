<hr><a name="background"></a><b>Background</b>
<p>Thermodynamic estimates of tropical cyclone intensity have provided
a good tool for both understanding and predicting the factors that affect
the intensification of tropical cyclones. These estimates employ the available
energy existing in the atmosphere, together with that which becomes available
from air-sea interactions, to provide an objective estimate of the maximum
intensity that can be achieved. Published approaches either view tropical
cyclones as a heat engine (Emanuel 1986, 1991, 1995) or treat themas a
balance between moist adiabatic heating and buoyancy forcing (Holland,
1997).&nbsp; Using observed monthly SST and real-time radiosonde sounding
data near the tropicalcyclones location, Tonkin et al. (1998) evaluated
both Emanuel and Holland's Maximum Potential Intensity (MPI) models against
observed maximum intensity for a large number
<br>of tropical cyclones. Results suggest that the thermodynamic model
provides a good estimation (+- 20 hPa) of maximum intensity achieved by
tropical cyclones. More recent work by the authors, as yet unpublished,
has found that several dynamical factors contribute substantially to limiting
the potential for tropical cyclones to reach the thermodynamic limit.
<p>The approach developed by Holland (1997) was used by Henderson-Sellers
et al. (1997) for estimating the potential changes of cyclone intensity
associated with anthropogenic climate change. The results were subsequently
confirmed in an independent modelling study by Knutson et al. (1998).
<p>Therefore, the thermodynamic model provides an objective method of evaluating
the climatology of the MPI and any changes of MPI that might be caused
by climate change.&nbsp; AMIP II experiments provide good opportunity to
both extend the work of Henderson-Sellers et al. (1997) and to evaluate
additional parameters that may inhibit intensification.
<p><a name="Objectives"></a><b>Objectives</b>
<p>The main objectives of this subproject are:
<ul>
<li>
To estimate the global MPI over ocean, including the evaluation of the
climatology of MPI for current climate using both climate model output
and the NCEP reanalysis.</li>

<li>
To update and extend the work of Henderson-Sellers et al (1997) by application
of the approach of Holland (1997) to climate change scenarios, and to examine
the impact of several dynamical processes.</li>
</ul>
<a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<p>The thermodynamical approach of Holland (1997) will be applied to AMIP
II simulation
<br>outputs to estimate MPI. In addition, we shall apply the recent work
of Holland, Wang
<br>and Qu on the limitations on intensification induced by dynamical processes.
<p>The estimated MPI will be compared with the MPI calculated using the
NCEP reanalysis
<br>data set in order to assess the ability of the AMIP II models to simulate
the MPI.
<p>The observed Tropical Cyclone Best Track data for different basins will
be used to
<br>validate the estimated MPI.
<p><a name="Data Requirements"></a><b>Data Requirements</b>
<p>Low frequency (monthly mean) data will be used.&nbsp; We will require
the following model
<br>output fields, structured by tables as in the AMIP II Standard Model
