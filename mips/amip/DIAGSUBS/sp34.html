<hr align=LEFT size=4 width="100%"><a name="background"></a>Background
<p>The knowledge of the water vapor distribution and its transport is essential
for the understanding of the global water cycle of the atmosphere.&nbsp;
Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas and in the context of
a global climate change, it is usually considered to introduce a strong
positive feedback [Manabe and Wetherald, 1967].&nbsp; Despite the decrease
of specific humidity wiht height, the upper level moisture can play an
important role in the climate system through radiative processes [Schmetz
et al., 1995]. Hence a good description of the upper level humidity is
an important challenge for GCM's [Harries, 1996].
<p>A net effect of convection appears to be a moistening of the upper atmosphere
[Soden and Fu, 1995], so that, knowledge of the relationship between convective
activity and water vapor distribution is also one of the key issues for
modelling the atmosphere. Indeed, a GCM should not only reproduce the observed
mean climatology, but also the correlation between different parameters
which are likely to induce feedbacks. In the present frame, the GCM should
reproduce a correct distribution of both cloudiness and upper level moisture
and, also the response of subtropical dry subsidence areas to a modification
of convective activity in the ITCZ.
<p>Using a conceptual model, [Pierrehumbert, 1995] shows that the relationship
between convective tropical area and subtropical subsiding area is an important
parameter controlling the energy balance of the tropics, and [Picon et
al., 1995] deduced from Meteosat water vapor channel data a negative relationship
between the extension of the ITCZ and the size of the subtropical subsiding
areas.
<p>Recent work at LMD based on direct comparison between observed, Meteosat
water vapor channel equivalent brightness temperature (WVEBT) and simulated
WVEBT from the LMD GCM outputs, assessed the capacity of the LMD GCM to
reproduce the observed link, on a seasonal scale, between the size of the
ITCZ and the extension of subtropical subsiding areas [Roca et al., 1997].
<p><a name="objective"></a><b>Objectives</b>
<p>The objectives of this subproject are two fold :
<ul>
<li>
Evaluate the quality of the models climatologies of WVEBT versus the observations.</li>

<li>
Check the GCMs ability to reproduce&nbsp; the large scale relationship
between the extension of the ITCZ and the extension of subtropical subsiding
zones on seasonal and interannual scales.</li>
</ul>
<a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<p>II.1 METEOSAT water vapor channel data
<p>METEOSAT is a geostationary plateform located at the equator at 0 degrees
of longitude. The first one the serie was launched in late 70's and METEOSAT-7
has been launched on the 3rd of September 97. In this subproject, we will
use the data from its so-called water vapor channel, centered on the vibration-rotation
band of the water vapor around 6.3 microns. In clear sky conditions, it
is mainly influenced by the water vapor between 300 and 600 millibars,
whereas in cloudy atmosphere, it is sensible to the cloud top temperature
modulated by the water vapor above. METEOSAT water vapor channel has a
vicarious calibration that makes use of a radiatve transfer model and of
rawinsondes [Schmetz and Turpeinen, 1988].
<p>The monthly mean water vapor equivalent brightness temperatures patterns
have been linked to large-scale dynamics features : the coldest brightness
temperatures (CBTs) are associated to upwards vertical movement and the
warmest brightness temperatures (WBTs) are linked to subsiding motions
[Picon and Desbois, 1990].
<p>On a monthly mean basis, it has been shown using ISCCP cloud products,
that the CBTs from that channel are strongly correlated with high and thick
clouds and that the WBTs are associated with low levels clouds or clear
sky [Picon et al., 1995]. Hence the CBTs are related to the ITCZ and the
WBTs to the dry subsiding zones.
<p>II.2&nbsp;&nbsp; The model-to-satellite approach
<p>We will use a narrow band radiative transfer model to simulate the WVEBT
from the temperature, specific humidity profiles, introducing the cloudiness
profile consistently in the calculation. This model has 10 spectral intervals
covering the METEOSAT water vapor spectrum and was designed by Jean-Jacques
Morcrette, ECMWF, from an improved version of the code described in [Morcrette
and Fouquart, 1985]. The response function of the satellite captor is taken
into account explicitely by convoluting the spectral radiances with the
filter function of the instrument. The viewing angle is also taken into
account in the computation.
<p>This narrow band has been validated in the water vapor band against
the operational code of EUMETSAT and gives similar results within 1 Kelvin
in clear sky [Roca and Picon, 1997].
<p>The clouds are treated as grey bodies as in the original code and classical
overlap assumptions are available for the total sky radiance computation.
Using a set of temperature, humidity profiles from the ECMWF analysis together
with clouds profiles derived from EUMETSAT operational products, comparaisons
with observations yield a good agreement between observed and simulated
total sky brightness temperatures,&nbsp; within 3K for the maximum overlap
assumption [Roca, 1999].
<p>In this way, we can make direct comparison with Meteosat water vapor
images from both cloudy and clear part of the atmosphere without applying
any cloud-clearing algorithm to the satellite data.
<p>II.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Simulated climatology assessment
<br>Before studying in deep , the relationship between convection and upper-level
moisture in the GCMs, one needs to characterize the main behavior of the
models. This part of the proposed work accounts as much as the second point.
Precisely, by comparing the observed and simulated WVEBT fields, we evaluate
the ability of the GCMs to reproduce an observed important field over differents
time scale.
<p>For example,&nbsp; Figure 1 shows this kind of comparison for one integration
of the LMD-GCM cycle 6 with prescribed SST for an averaged july from 1983
to 1986. Fig 1(top) presents the observed monthly mean of the WVEBT. The
coldest patterns clearly identify the ITCZ, and the subsidence areas, both
side of the equator are also well characterized. The simulated field (fig
1 middle) shows up some relevant patterns like the ITCZ over Africa and
the southern hemisphere subsiding zone shape is in agreement with the observations.
Some discrepancies also appear: the nearly absent ITCZ over the Atlantic
ocean and the strong dry zone over the Azores which is not so develloped
in the observations. The extrema in the simulation are stretched compare
to the observations.
<br>Finally fig 1(bottom) is the difference between simulated and observed
WVEBT. The GCM has a very wet (cold) zone within the ITCZ over Ethiopia
which related to a well know cloud cover and precipitation overestimation
in the LMD-GCM over these moutains.
<p>But overall, this difference exhibits a double bias in the GCM: the
simulated WVEBT are warmer over the ITCZ and are colder over the observed
subsiding areas. In terms of moisture, it means that the GCM has a dry
(resp. wet) bias over the ITCZ (resp. upper level of the subsiding zones).
This seems to be a characteristic of many GCMs [Schmetz and Van de Berg,
1994; Soden and Bretherton, 1994; Roca et al., 1997] and may be important
to be checked over the AMIP2 participating models.
<p>Such a diagnostic can be related to problems in the simulation as diagnosticed
by the WGNE standard diagnostic and help to characterize them.
<p>II.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship between convection and upper-level moisture
<br>Aware of the eventual bias of the GCMs, one can now go deeper in the
analysis since models should reproduce climatology but also relationships
that implies important variables.&nbsp; This second part of the proposed
work aims to check the ability of model to reproduce an observed relationship
between the extension of the ITCZ and the extension of the subtropical
subsidence areas, which indicates that a broader ITCZ is associated with
smaller dry subsidence zones, i.e. an increase of convective activity in
the ITCZ leads to wetter subtropical subsiding zones [Picon et al., 1995;
Roca et al., 1997].
<p>The size of the ITCZ is defined using an arbitrary threshold and is
a first order indicator of the convective activity in this region. Similarly,
a second threshold allows to discriminate the subsiding zone. The prodecude
is fully detailled in [Picon et al., 1995]. Then, time series of these
indices will be computed, first over a mean seasonal cycle and then over
the anomalie fields computed from the 12 years of data and of simulations,
in order to assess the GCMs simulation of this large-scale moistening.
<p>Fig 2 is taken from the simulation described in Roca et al., 1997 and
shows this relationship over a mean seasonal cycle computed from a 5 years
period for both data and the LMD-GCM. The negative correlation indicates
that a broader ITCZ is associated with smaller dry subsidence zones in
the observations as well as in the GCM.
<p>In the present proposed diagnostic, we will consider both seasonal and
interannual variabilities of the upper tropospheric humidity and ITCZ size
to encompass differents modifications of the convective activity and related
dry zones.
<p>III Computation strategy and data
<p>II.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Methodological bias characterization
<br>Monthly means of Meteosat WVEBT are constructed from the imagery available
every 3 hours and are compared to synthetic WVEBT computed from the monthly
means of the models outputs, since the air temperature, specific humidity
and cloudiness profiles are not available on a six-hourly basis. We expecte
a slight bias induced by the use of monthly mean outputs[Chen et al., 1997].
<p>We have investigated this bias in details with the cycle 6 of the LMD-GCM.
This model is an improved version of the LMD model described in [Sadourny
and Laval, 1984] and has a diurnal cycle and a advanced surface scheme.
More details about this version of the model are avaliable in [Polcher
and Laval, 95].
<p>To assess the weak sensitivity of the simulated WVEBT monthly mean to
time sampling of the GCM outputs and to confirm the feasibility of this
diagnostic using monthly means of temperature, humidity and cloud profiles
provided by AMIP2, the LMD-GCM was run for July 1993 and outputs where
sampled as follow:
<p>a. One single monthly mean
<br>b. 30 daily means
<br>c. 120 4xdaily means (6 hours averages)
<br>d. 120 4xdaily snapshots (every 6 hours, no averaging)
<p>WVEBT simulations were performed for each of these runs and averaged
in monthly means. The comparison is done with respect to the first simulation
here considered as the reference.
<p>The figure 3(top) shows zonal mean differences between monthly mean
simulations of the METEOSAT-4 WVEBT in July 1993 for the runs b.(plain
line), c.(dashed line), d.(dotted line) and the reference (run a.). The
maximum difference occurs in the southern hemisphere&nbsp; and concerns
the 6 hourly snapshot run. This maximum reaches 1.5 Kelvin which is around
the uncertainties of the whole prodecure. For the others runs, this difference
is even smaller. Notice the small discrepancies between 30 daily averaged
inputs and 6 hourly averaged inputs.
<p>Overall, the frequency of GCM outputs have a weak impact on the final
WVEBT monthly mean and has to be related to difference between GCM WVEBT
and observations. Figure 3(bottom) represents the difference between run
a. and the observed WVEBT monthly mean build from the 3 hourly imagery.
This difference is large and may reach up to -15 Kelvin over a large part
of the considered region imagery, indicating that time sampling bias in
the comparison can be considered as negligible.
<p>These results imply that we can use the monthly mean outputs from GCM
as defined by the AMIP Panel to process our diagnostic without any important
methodological bias.
<p>III.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Satellite data
<br>We will consider the data from July 1983 to July 1995, i.e. from METEOSAT-2
to METEOSAT-5. These data are avalaible through the ISCCP program, in the
climatological studies adapted B3 format (1 pixel over 6 is retained from
the full resolution). Over the 1983-1995 period, many changes occured in
the METEOSAT time serie (changes of filter function of the captor, operational
calibration modifications). Hence the long term observations of METEOSAT
cannot be used as is. An intercalibration technique has been developped
at LMD [Picon et al., 1998] and has been applied to homogeneise the long
term serie of water vapor data [Picon et al., 1999] and is ready for use
in this diagnostic subproject.
<p>The observed monthly means images will be computed from this intercalibrated
database using the imagery every three hours.
<p>III.3&nbsp;&nbsp; AMIP variables needed

from the GCMs are needed:
<p>Air temperature , Specific humidity , cloud fraction
