<ul><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>The diagnostic subproject proposed
here is a continuation of Diagnostic Subproject No. 8 (Polar Processes
and Sea Ice) in AMIP-I. This subproject has focussed on the AMIP model-simulated
fields that are most relevant to the forcing of sea ice. Examples are the
near-surface temperatures (Tao et al., 1996), precipitation (Walsh et al.,
1997), surface winds (Cattle, ongoing) and the surface energy fluxes over
sea ice (Maslanik, ongoing). In addition, the AMIP simulations of moisture
fluxes and energy budgets over the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are
being examined by Bromwich and by Kattsov and Meleshko. A substantial part
of the collective effort in Subproject No. 8 has been invested in the enhancement
of the datasets required to assess the polar output of the AMIP models.
In the papers referenced above, for example, gridded datasets available
through PCMDI have been augmented with Arctic-specific data on temperature
and precipitation from various sources. The results of the collective effort
of our AMIP Phase I diagnostic subproject are being consolidated into a
report for submission to the WCRP.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>&nbsp;Several of the individual
efforts in our subproject are ongoing and will continue into the period
of AMIP-II. These studies will clearly benefit from the extended simulation
periods, from the inclusion of the additional variables in the Standard
Output and from the use of more realistic sea ice boundary conditions (concentrations)
vis-a-vis AMIP-I. More importantly, however, the next phase of a polar
diagnostic subproject will mesh with two major efforts that are coming
to fruition subsequent to our AMIP-I subproject. The first is the completion
of the atmospheric reanalysis projects at NCEP and ECMWF. While the reanalysis
products will be the cornerstone of many AMIP-II diagnoses and assessments,
their derived fields (e.g., surface fluxes, radiative fields) provide an
unprecedented opportunity to extend the diagnoses of polar simulations
in climate models. Second, 1997 marked the start of several coordinated
Arctic field programs: SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean),
DOE's ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) program on the North Slope
of Alaska and Adjacent Arctic Ocean, and NASA's FIRE-III campaign over
the Arctic Ocean [see Randall et al. (1998) for an overview]. All of these
programs are motivated by the need for data to test and improve the simulation
of polar processes in global climate models. Thus the opportunities for
meaningful collaboration between the polar and global climate modeling
communities will accelerate dramatically in the next few years, and our
proposed AMIP-II subproject is intended to provide a significant bridge
between the two communities.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>&nbsp;The earlier subproject also
included an examination of snow cover in the AMIP-I simulations (Frei and
Robinson, 1995). Because snow cover extends well beyond the polar regions,
and indeed varies primarily in middle latitudes during the northern winter,
we have concluded that the snow cover diagnosis in AMIP-II is more logically
a separate diagnostic subproject. Consequently, D. Robinson (Rutgers) and
R. Brown (Atmospheric Environment Service) will submit an AMIP-II subproject
proposal that will specifically address hemispheric snow cover.</font></font>

<a name="objectives"></a><b>Subproject description: Objectives, methodologies,
data requirements</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>While the scope of the proposed polar subproject is intended
to be sufficiently broad to allow for the entrainment of additional investigators
having polar interests, several foci have emerged: (1) polar clouds and
radiative fluxes, (2) the polar water vapor fluxes (lateral as well as
surface fluxes), and (3) downslope airflow in the vicinity of ice sheet
margins. In addition, we hope to stimulate AMIP-II experiments pertaining
to (a) the parameterization of horizontal thickness variations and leads
in pack ice, and (b) the inclusion of ice-phase microphysical processes
in polar clouds. These foci are addressed sequentially in the following
paragraphs.
<p>&nbsp;(1) Polar clouds and their radiative interactions are the scientific
drivers of the ARM, SHEBA and FIRE programs. For the evaluation and development
of parameterizations of cloud/radiative interactions, the field phases
(1997-98) of these programs have been designed to produce an Arctic dataset
containing vertical profiles of cloud and aerosol characteristics (e.g.,
ice and liquid water); radiative fluxes at the surface, top of atmosphere
and within the atmosphere; surface albedo and the interfacial fluxes of
sensible and latent heat. These variables will be compiled into averages
for GCM grid-sized areas. We will use this dataset as a benchmark for evaluating
the cloud and radiative fields in the AMIP-II simulations. The evaluations
will draw upon the following variables in the AMIP-II standard output (cf.
Tables 1 and 2 in AMIP-II Guidelines):
<p>&nbsp;Table 1: cloud fraction
<blockquote>&nbsp; cloud amount (surface and satellite views)
<br>&nbsp; cloud liquid water
<br>&nbsp; cloud ice
<br>&nbsp; extinction coefficient
<br>&nbsp; cloud emittance</blockquote>
&nbsp;Table 2: surface incident and reflected SW radiation
<blockquote>&nbsp; surface downwelling and upwelling LW radiation
<br>&nbsp; TOA reflected SW radiation
<br>&nbsp; TOA outgoing LW radiation
<br>&nbsp; net radiation at model top
<br>&nbsp; surface sensible heat flux
<br>&nbsp; surface latent heat flux
<br>&nbsp; surface evaporation (+ sublimation) rate
<br>&nbsp; vertically integrated cloud water
<br>&nbsp; vertically integrated cloud ice</blockquote>

<p><br>In using the AMIP-II standard output, we will work primarily with
the climatological (17-year) monthly means. It will be necessary to assume
that the SHEBA/ARM/FIRE datasets are representative of the corresponding
observational climatological means. Our experience with the AMIP-I output
suggests that the across-model scatter of the means of key Arctic variables
(e.g., surface radiative fluxes, surface evaporation) is considerably larger
than the estimated variability of the decadal-scale means of the observational
values.
<p>(2) Atmospheric water vapor transports are central components of the
hydrological cycles of the polar regions. Our AMIP-I work included an intercomparison
of the surface evaporative fluxes in the various models, together with
an attempt to diagnose the model-to-model differences in these fluxes (Walsh
et al., 1998). However, a more comprehensive diagnosis of the hydrologic
cycle was limited by the availability of output required for diagnostic
computations of poleward moisture fluxes (i.e., high-frequency v and q
with adequate vertical resolution). The inclusion of the mean product for
v and q for 17 levels in the AMIP-II output (Table 1) will permit more
complete closure of the models' polar moisture budgets and will permit
direct comparisons with corresponding quantities in the reanalyses. We
will perform systematic comparisons of the atmospheric moisture fluxes
and flux convergences in the AMIP-II models (and in the reanalysis output)
for several regions: the Arctic polar cap (70? -90? N), Greenland and Antarctica.
Bromwich will assume the lead role in the studies of the Greenland and
Antarctic regions, while Walsh will work with M. Serreze (U. Colorado)
in the moisture budget study for the central Arctic. A key issue of the
regional budget studies will be the partitioning of the moisture "source
term" between advective influx and surface evaporation (sublimation).
<p>(3)&nbsp; Downslope or katabatic winds are prominent features of the
coastal climates of Antarctica, Greenland and, to a lesser extent, the
smaller icecaps of the Northern Hemisphere. Because these winds lead to
coastal polynya formation by advecting sea ice offshore, they play important
roles in air-sea energy exchange, sea ice formation (i.e., new ice growth)
and the associated input of salt to the upper ocean (Liu et al., 1997).
The ability of models to capture the katabatic wind regime will be a key
issue for coupled model simulations of atmosphere-ocean interaction in
the areas surrounding the ice sheets. While katabatic winds have been reproduced
in short simulations with limited-area models of the atmosphere (Bromwich
et al., 1994), their simulation in global models has received little attention.
We propose to assess the AMIP-II model simulations of the katabatic wind
regimes over Antarctica and Greenland by evaluating the downslope wind
component relative to the synoptic-scale pressure gradients in the same
regions. The difference between the downslope wind component and the value
implied by the pressure gradient will provide an index of the katabatic
component of the wind. Since the ability of the reanalyses to capture katabatic
winds has yet to be determined, the verification will draw upon the routine
wind reports from coastal stations of Antarctica and Greenland, as well
as from the automated weather station (AWS) network of Antarctica and from
buoys on the Antarctic ice shelves.
<p>The major part of the katabatic wind assessment will utilize monthly
mean fields of the AMIP-II Standard Output: surface (10 m) winds, mean
sea level pressure and surface pressure (Table 2 of AMIP-II Guidelines).
The katabatic assessment will also require the surface topography grid
of each model (Table 5). In addition, we will select several models for
an examination of the high-frequency variations of the downslope wind component
in order to assess the models' abilities to simulate Katabatic Surge Events
(Liu et al., 1997), which represent an interplay between offshore synoptic
conditions and the downslope drainage phenomenon. This sub-task will require
the six-hourly values of surface (10 m) wind and pressure (Table 6) from
a subset of 3-5 models. A few annual cycles of the high-frequency output
from these models should be sufficient. We will inform all the AMIP-II
modeling groups of these needs, thereby offering any interested groups
the opportunity to provide this output either through the AMP-II Supplementary
Output or directly to our diagnostic subproject (D. Bromwich).
<p>In addition to the analyses of AMIP-II standard and supplementary output
as described above, we will work within the AMIP-II framework to encourage
numerical experimentation on two topics: (1) the role of ice-phase microphysics
in the seasonal cycle of Arctic cloudiness (Beesley and Moritz, 1999) and
the model sensitivities to sea ice thickness and the thickness distribution
(Rind et al., 1997). A first step will be preliminary experiments with
at least one model. The NCAR CSM is a natural candidate because it is available
to the broad community of university scientists and we have already contacted
the CSM Polar Working Group (J. Weatherly, co-chair) in order to initiate
action on this issue. Other models available to us for such purposes are
the MGO and UKMO global models. The second step, contingent on the results
from the first step, will be an experimental subproject proposal to AMIP-II.
The experimental subproject will complement the diagnostic subproject discussed
here, but it will not involve all participants in the diagnostic subproject.</blockquote>
