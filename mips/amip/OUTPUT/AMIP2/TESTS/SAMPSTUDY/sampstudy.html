<h3 align=CENTER>Testing some sampling, interpolation and data compression
issues in AMIP II</h3>

<h4 align=CENTER>(Work in progress) </h4>

<p>This document summarizes an exersize to address some questions regarding
the AMIP II model output. Sampling, interpolation and data compression tests have 
been made with the <a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd_ToC.html">
LMD</a>,<a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/23llnl_ToC.html"> LLNL</a>
and <a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/28ncar_ToC.html">NCAR</a>
models. Other groups that have performed relevant calculations are encouraged
to contact the AMIP&nbsp;Project Office (<a href="mailto:amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov">amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov</a>)
to arrange having their findings posted at this site. Model output resulting
from these experiments will be made available to the AMIP&nbsp;diagnostic
community so that they may study the importance of the issues raised here
to their own analysis. The problem: Unquantified or not fully understood
implications of some recommendations associated with the AMIP II standard
model output.</p>

<center><p><b><font size=+1>Questions addressed
</font></b></p></center><font size=+1>

<p><b><font size=+1>Temporal sampling:</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">To what extent are monthly averages biased
by using 6-hour snapshots instead of accumulating every time step?
</font></p>

<p>Tests: Calculate the monthly average both ways for those fields in Table
1 with footnote 2 (i.e., based on 4/day instantaneous values), and ground
temperature, surface pressure, u/v(10m) and q(2m) from Table 2. For consistency,
all 3-d calculations should be accumulated to the 17 p-surfaces and then
time averaged. </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">What is the effect of computing monthly average
<i>mean products</i>  (or covariances) based on 6-hour instantaneous values rather 
than on every model time step? Additionally, what is the effect of using 6-hr averages
rather than 6-hour snapshots, and is the estimate much different from sampling
daily? </font></p>

<p>Tests: Calculate the four mean products in Table 1b five different ways,
based on i) 6-hr instantaneous, ii) 6-hr averages, iii) daily instantaneous
iv) daily averages v) every time step. For consistency, fields should be
interpolated to p surfaces and then time averaged. </p>

<p><b><font size=+1>Vertical interpolaton:
</font></b></p><font size=+1>

<p><font color="#0000FF">What are the differences between
 computing monthly averages in either  i) model coordinates, ii) in model 
coordinates weighted by <i>time varying</i> mass (as described in 
Trenberth, NCAR/TN-396+STR), or iii) on the 17 WMO pressure surfaces?
</font> </p>

<p>Tests performed: Each of the three calculations are made for all terms
in Table 1. The sampling is consistent with the AMIP II recommendations
which are variable dependent. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Are vertical profiles of fields with sharp
gradients such as cloud-related fields significantly effected by the interpolation
process?</font></p>

<p>Tests performed: Monthly mean data was available on the model sigma/pressure
hybrid vertical coordinate. Using the surface pressure at each gridpoint,
the corresponding pressure level at each gridpoint was determined. These
data were then linearly interpolated to the 17 AMIP pressure levels. Although
more sophisticated interpolation techniques might be used, it was felt
at this stage to keep this aspect of the study very simple. Additionally,
the model pressure data (ie, the equivalent pressure of the monthly mean
eta coordinate levels) and the AMIP interpolated data were linearly interpolated
to a very fine vertical grid of 5 mb spacing. This was done to allow differences
to be computed. </p>

<p><font size=+1><b>Compression issues</b> </font></p><font size=+1>

<p><font color="#0000FF">What are the potential implications of &quot;aggressive&quot;
compression on 6-hourly model output.  For example,  what effect does this have
on calculations that involve divergence?.  </font></p>

<p>Tests: Save at 64bit the fields in Table 3, and as much of the Table
6 fields as possible. These data will be truncated to varying degrees with
LATS (either at PCMDI or by each participating modeler). These data will
be used in a variety of diagnostic calculations expected to be sensitive
to the truncation. </p>
