<hr>Perspectives of the AMIP Panel, the PCMDI and many others have formed
the basis for the AMIP II Standard Model Output listing. However, some

in the dry and moist convective temperature tendencies?</font></b>

<p>The final temperature tendency from the convection scheme is what is
desired. Whether that comes directly from latent heat release or indirectly
from the induced subsidence is not the point. Dry convective processes
refer to dry adiabiatic adjustment which is often needed explicitly over
deserts for example although, in some models, vertical diffusion does the
job. The "adiabatic subsidence" associated with cumulus convection should
be not be counted as a dry convective process, but rather included along
with detrainment as a moist convective process.

<p>For consistency, the moisture tendency should include water vapour only.
