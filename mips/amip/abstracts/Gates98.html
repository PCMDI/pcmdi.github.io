<P>The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), initiated in 1989
under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme, undertook the
systematic validation, diagnosis and intercomparison of the performance
of atmospheric general circulation models. For this purpose all models
were required to simulate the evolution of the climate during the decade
1979-1988, subject to the observed monthly-average temperature and sea
ice and a common prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and solar constant.&nbsp;
By 1995 thirty one modeling groups, representing virtually the entire international
atmospheric modeling community, had contributed the required standard output
of the monthly means of selected statistics.&nbsp; These data have been
analyzed by the participating modeling groups, by the Program for Climate
Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), and by the more than two dozen
AMIP diagnostic subprojects that have been established to examine specific
aspects of the models' performance.&nbsp; Here we summarize the analysis
and validation of the AMIP results as a whole, which serves to document
the overall performance of atmospheric general circulation/climate models
as of the early 1990's. We also report on the infrastructure and plans
for continuation of the AMIP project.

<P>&nbsp;Although there are apparent model outliers in each simulated variable
examined, validation of the AMIP models' ensemble mean shows that the average
large-scale seasonal distributions of pressure, temperature and circulation
are reasonably close to what are believed to be the best observational
estimates available.&nbsp; The large-scale structure of the ensemble mean
precipitation and ocean surface heat flux also resemble the observed estimates,
but show particularly large intermodel differences in low latitudes.&nbsp;
The total cloudiness, on the other hand, is rather poorly simulated, especially
in the Southern Hemisphere.&nbsp; The models' simulation of the seasonal
cycle (as represented by the amplitude and phase of the first annual harmonic
of sea-level pressure) closely resembles the observed variation in almost
all regions.&nbsp; The ensemble's simulation of the interannual variability
of sea-level pressure in the tropical Pacific is reasonably close to that
observed (except for its underestimate of the amplitude of major El Ninos),
while the interannual variability is less-well simulated in mid-latitudes.&nbsp;
When analyzed in terms of the variability of the evolution of their combined
space-time patterns in comparison to observations, the AMIP models are
seen to exhibit a wide range of accuracy, with no single model performing
best in all respects.

<P>&nbsp;Analysis of the subset of the original AMIP models for which revised
versions have subsequently been used to revisit the experiment, shows a
substantial reduction of the models' systematic errors in simulating cloudiness,
but only a slight reduction of the mean seasonal errors of most other variables.&nbsp;
In order to understand better the nature of these errors and to accelerate
the rate of model improvement, an expanded and continuing project (AMIP
II) is being undertaken in which analysis and intercomparison will address
a wider range of variables and processes, using an improved diagnostic
and experimental infrastructure.
