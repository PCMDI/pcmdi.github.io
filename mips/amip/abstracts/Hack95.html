<B>Hack, J. J.</B> and J. Kiehl, 1995: Reduction of systematic errors
in the NCAR CCM2. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific
Conference, Monterey, California, 96.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The NCAR Community Climate Model was extensively redesigned with the
introduction of the CCM2 in order to produce a state-of-the-art atmospheric
general circulation model which was easy to use and to modify. Excessively
simplified physical parameterizations, particularly for the determination
of surface temperature, surface energy exchanges, boundary layer transfers,
moist convection, and the diagnosis of cloud amount and its interaction
with the radiation field, were all improved. Consequently, the overall
CCM2 climate was substantially better than climates produced by previous
versions of the CCM, which suffered from a variety of large systematic
biases in the mean climate state.

<P>Although many of the aspects of the CCM2 simulation represent improvements,
a number of important systematic deficiencies remain, particularly in the
context of coupling the CCM2 to land and ocean component models. These
include a large warm bias in simulated July surface temperature over the
Northern Hemisphere, a systematic overprediction of precipitation maxima,
primarily over warm land areas, excessive ridging over the North Pacific
and an anomalous reduction in the height field over Western North America
in January, and cold polar tropopause temperatures. Our current understanding
of the sources of these simulation deficiencies are in various stages of
development, as are the associated solution strategies. We will report
on the reduction of many of these systematic errors in the latest version
of the NCAR CCM which has been developed as the atmospheric component for
the NCAR Climate Systems Modelling initiative. We will illustrate the improvements
in the simulation, both regionally and globally, and discuss the physical
reasons for the response. We will also describe ongoing activities aimed
at further improving the suitability of the CCM as an atmospheric component
in future community coupled modeling initiatives.
