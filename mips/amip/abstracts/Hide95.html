<BR>Irregular fluctuations in all three components of the Earth's rotation
vector on sub-decadal time scales are excited by compensating fluctuations
in the total angular momentum of the atmosphere, through stresses exerted
by the atmosphere on the underlying planet in the oceanic and continental
boundary layers, and also over topography, (including the equatorial bulge).
Their determinations by geodesists and astronomers serve as a useful surrogate
data set for atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) fluctuations, which are
intimately linked with global-scale energy fluctuations and must be simulated
correctly in any successful global numerical model. In Diagnostic Sub-Project
15 (Atmospheric Angular Momentum) we have intercompared the AMIP models
on the basis of their ability to represent the observed seasonal and interannual
AAM fluctuations and certain well-established regional phenomena discovered
in recent AAM studies. We have also investigated regional contributions
to the discrepancies between models revealed by the intercomparisons. When
AMIP "history data" become available, these studies will be extended to
shorter (intra-seasonal) time scales, where pronounced AAM fluctuations
are also known to occur. Detailed accounts of our findings to date are
in preparation for submission to various journals.
