<BR><I>Soil moisture</I>

<P>We compared simulations of soil moisture by the AMIP climate models
with observations taken in the former Soviet Union (FSU) for 1979-1985,
the People's Republic of China for 1981-1988 (which extend to 1991 in our
collection), and the state of Illinois in the United States for 1983-1988
(which extend to the present). The mean annual cycles and interannual variations
were compared to plant available soil moisture in the upper 1 m of soil
using data from more than 100 stations from the FSU, more than 100 from
China, and 17 from Illinois.

<P>In general, the model output was quite different from the data. The
reasons for these discrepancies were investigated. Models with 15-cm field
capacities did not capture the large high latitude values of soil moisture.
This has implications for their ability to also properly simulate evapotranspiration,
sensible heat flux, and runoff. The observed interannual variations of
soil moisture in Russia were not captured by any of the AMIP models. This
implies that interannual variations of precipitation in this region are
not driven by global sea surface temperature variations. Interannual variations
in China and the United States were also investigated. It was also found
that several models have large soil moisture trends during the first year
or two of the AMIP simulations, with potentially large impacts on global
hydrological cycle trends and on other climate elements. This is because
the simulations were begun without spinning up the soil moisture to the
model climatology, and soil moisture has a long enough memory to influence
climate for this time scale.

<P><I>Humidity and moisture fluxes</I>

<P>We have also examined aspects of tropospheric humidity by comparing
total column precipitable water (W) and zonally-averaged specific humidity
(q) fields from AMIP models with various observations. Our best verification
data for the AMIP period are radiosonde observations over the continent
of North America. There we find that the majority of the models simulate
the annual cycle, including its asymmetry, and the meridional profile of
W reasonably well, although there are a few far outliers. Simulations of
interannual variations in W are very diverse and generally quite poor.

<P>To expand the study to tropical (10S-10N) and midlatitude (30N-50N)
bands, we used ECMWF analyses as verification data. The AMIP models underestimate
zonally averaged q below 500 hPa and slightly overestimate it above. Relative
humidity simulations show a very broad range of values at all levels for
both regions. The models capture the seasonal shift over the Northern Hemisphere
oceans, where the maximum in W shifts eastward from summer to winter. However,
the models appear to overestimate W substantially in the western Pacific
during JJA.

<P>On the global scale, we used analyses of radiosonde data by A. Oort
to examine W and the net meridional flux of water vapor. Decadal- and global-mean
values of W tend to be lower for the AMIP models than estimates from the
observations, and differences of up to 15% exist among the model values.
As over N. America, the seasonal cycle in global W appears to be generally
well simulated, although there is a larger range of model values during
northern summer than at other times. Interannual variations in the models'
global W are marked by an ENSO signal (which is not prominent in the N.
American simulations), but the reality of this signal is difficult to confirm
with available observations. The simulated net poleward fluxes of water
vapor across midlatitudes, inferred from the models' hydrological fields,
appear to be too large, with possibly important consequences for the energetics
of these models.

<P>For most parameters, we find that a consensus (the mean or the median)
of the models agrees with the observations better than any individual model
does. We have also developed preliminary skill scores for quantitatively
aggregating our intercomparison diagnostic results for water vapor.
