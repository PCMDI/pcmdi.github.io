<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The technique of common principal
components (CPC) is applied to compare the results of a number of GCM simulations.
The data used are the 120 monthly mean fields from 30 Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations and an ensemble of five AMIP
integrations from a single GCM. The spatial grid and 120 time points allows
the calculation of up to 31 covariance matrices for input into the CPC
analyses.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The CPC methodology is applied to
a variety of model comparision problems within the context of the AMIP
experiment. The aspects of the simulations used for demonstration are the
seasonal cycle of precipitation over the United States, the global 200-hPa
velocity potential, and the difference between the 200-hPa divergence of
four closely related AMIP models and the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and a small
ensemble of simulations (five) of the European Centre for MediumRange Weather
Forecasts AMIP model.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">These analyses demonstrate the utility
of the CPC approach in identifying models systematic errors, the reduction
of data in ensembles of simulation, and in model parameterization comparisons.
The common errors among the models tend to highlight the area in which
a gap in knowledge or parameterization implementation exists. In addition
CPC analyses provide a more complete statistical picture of an emsemble
of simulations within a single model than the traditional means and variances.
It is often the common aspects of the ensembles that are sought as a robust
signal.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The CPC analyses tend to support
the observation that the models often have more in common with each other
than with the observations. The CPC has the ability to answer many pertinent
questions posed in the arena of model comparison when used in conjunction
with other techniques.</FONT>
