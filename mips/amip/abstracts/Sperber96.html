<BR>The interannual variability of rainfall over the Indian subcontinent,
the African Sahel and the Nordeste region of Brazil have been evaluated
in 32 models for the period 1979-1988 as part of the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The interannual variations of Nordeste
rainfall are the most readily captured, owing to the intimate link with
Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The precipitation
variations over India and the Sahel are less well simulated. Additionally,
an Indian monsoon wind shear index was calculated for each model. Evaluation
of the interannual variability of a wind shear index over the summer monsoon
region indicates that the models exhibit greater fidelity in capturing
the large-scale dynamic fluctuations than the regional scale rainfall variations.
A rainfall/SST teleconnection quality control was used to objectively stratify
model performance. Skill scores improved for those models that qualitatively
simulated the observed rainfall/El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
SST correlation pattern. This subset of models also had a rainfall climatology
that was in better agreement with observations, indicating a link between
systematic model error and the ability to simulate interannual variations.

<P>A suite of six European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
AMIP runs (differing only in their initial conditions) have also been examined.
As observed, all-India rainfall was enhanced in 1988 relative to 1987 in
each of these realizations. All-India rainfall variability during other
years showed little or no predictability, possibly due to internal chaotic
dynamics associated with intraseasonal monsoon fluctuations, and/or unpredictable
land surface process interactions. The interannual variations of Nordeste
rainfall were better represented. The State University of New York at Albany/National
Center for Atmospheric Research (SUNY/NCAR) Genesis model was run in five
initial condition realizations. In this model, the Nordeste rainfall variability
was also best reproduced. However, for all regions the skill was less than
that of the ECMWF model.

<P>The relationship of the all-India and Sahel rainfall/SST teleconnections
with horizontal resolution, convection scheme closure, and numerics have
been evaluated. Models with resolution T42 performed more poorly than lower
resolution models. The higher resolution models were predominantly spectral.
At low resolution, spectral versus gridpoint numerics performed with nearly
equal verisimilitude. At low resolution, moisture convergence closure was
slightly more preferable than other convective closure techniques. At high
resolution, the models that used moisture convergence closure performed
very poorly, suggesting that moisture convergence may be problematic for
models with horizontal resolution >=T42.
