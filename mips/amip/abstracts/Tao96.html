<BR>Simulations of Arctic temperatures by 19 general circulation models
are examined as part of a diagnostic subproject of the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The forcing of all the models by observed
sea surface temperatures and sea ice from a 10-yr period (1979-1988) permits
comparative evaluations of the model biases as well as the models' simulations
of the interannual variations contained i n the observational data. The
models capture the latitudinal and seasonal variability of surface air
temperatures in the Arctic, although a cold bias of -3.3&deg;C (std dev
= 3.4&deg;C) is apparent over northern Eurasia during spring, espe4cially
in the models that do not include vegetative masking of the high-albedo
snow. The 19-model mean bias over northern North America is less than 2
degrees C in all seasons. Over the Arctic Ocean, the spring temperatures
generally have a warm bias that averages 3.0 (std dev = 2.9&deg;C), although
the bias is smaller in the models in which the prescribed albedo of sea
ice is highest. For the summer season, correlations between simulated cloudiness
and surface air temperatures are negative and statistically significant,
but the corresponding correlations for the winter months are small and
statistically insignificant. The models without gravity wave drag are generally
colder than the other models at the Arctic surface, especially during autumn.
