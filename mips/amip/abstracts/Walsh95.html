<BR>As part of the AMIP polar diagnostic subproject, the surface air temperatures
and energy budgets of 19 models have been examined. Over Greenland and
the Arctic Ocean, the models' annual mean temperatures vary by up to 10
degrees C, 1995: the Greenland surface air temperatures are biased by the
models' smoothing of the topography. Over the northern land areas (poleward
of 60&deg;N) and Antarctica, the range among models is as large as 15&deg;C.
The models capture the latitudinal and seasonal variability of Arctic temperatures,
although a cold bias of 1-3&deg;C is apparent over the northern continents,
especially during spring over Eurasia. A warm springtime bias over the
Arctic Ocean is smallest in those AMIP models in which the prescribed albedo
of sea ice is highest. Summer temperatures over the Arctic Ocean are negatively
correlated (r=-0.48) with the mean total cloud fractions of the models.
However, there is little correlation between total cloudiness and mean
surface air temperature during winter. In most models, the interannual
variations of the simulated and observed polar temperature show little
correlation, although one model (the DERF model) developed for long-range
forecasting shows skill over northern Eurasia.

<P>The components of the surface energy budget vary substantially from
model to model. Over the Arctic Ocean, the annual mean shortwave radiation
ranges among models from 30 to 60 Wm-2, 1995: the net surface longwave
radiation ranges from -20 to -65 Wm-2 , 1995: the annual mean sensible
heat flux ranges from -15 to +6 Wm-2 , 1995: and the annual mean evaporation
ranges from 0.15 to 0.75 mm day-1. The model-to-model range of several
of these quantities is even greater over Greenland and Antarctica. The
longwave radiative and sensible heat fluxes tend to compensate the model-to-model
differences of incoming shortwave radiation at the surface. The surface
shortwave radiation, in turn, correlates negatively with the models' spring
and summer cloud fractions. The radiative flux differences among the models
are large enough to produce sea ice thickness changes of more than 10 cm
yr -1 when used to force a thermodynamic sea ice model.&nbsp;
