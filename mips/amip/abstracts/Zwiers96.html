<BR>This study considers an ensemble of six 10-year climate simulations
conducted with the Canadian Climate Centre 2nd generation General Circulation
Model (CCC GCM2). Each simulation was forced according to the Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) experimental protocol using monthly
mean sea surface temperatures and sea-ice extents based on observations
for January, 1979 to December 1988. One simulation, conducted on a CRAY
computer, was initiated from analysed 1 January 1979 conditions while the
remaining 5 simulations, conducted on NEC computer, were initiated from
previously simulated model states obtained from a long control integration.
The interannual variability and potential predictability of simulated and
observed 500 hPa geopoential, 850 hPa temperature and 300 hPa stream function
are examined and inter-compared using statistical analysis of variance
techniques to partition variance into a number of components. The boundary
conditions specified by AMIP are found to induce statistically significant
amounts of predictable variance on the interannual time scale in the tropics
and, to a lesser extent, at extratropical latitudes. In addition, local
interactions between the atmosphere and the land surface apparently induce
significant amounts of potentially predictable interannual variance in
the tropical lower atmosphere and also at some locations in the temperate
lower atmosphere. No evidence was found that the atmosphere's internal
dynamics on their own generate potentially predictable variations on the
interannual time scale. The sensitivity of the statistical methods used
is demonstrated by the fact that we are able to detect differences between
the climates simulated on the two computers used. The causes of these physically
significant changes are traced. The statistical procedures are checked
by confirming that the choice of initial conditions does not lead to significant
inter-simulation variation. The simulations are also interpreted as an
ensemble of climate forecasts that rely only on the specified boundary
conditions for their predictive skill. The forecasts are verified against
observations and against themselves. In agreement with other studies, it
was found that the forecasts have very high skill in the tropics and moderate
skill in the extratropics.
