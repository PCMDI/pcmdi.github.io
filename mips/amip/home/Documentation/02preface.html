This hypertext summary documentation of the models participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) centralizes information on the features of most of today's global atmospheric models. 

<p>
The information herein is much the same as that provided by the hardcopy PCMDI Report No. 18, "A Summary Documentation of the AMIP Models" by Thomas J. Phillips, but with some additions and corrections (see <a href="01bckgrnd.html">History of Changes</a>). This documentation will surely undergo further changes as the AMIP experiment is performed with additional models.

<p>
The AMIP model documentation is organized at several levels of complexity (see <A HREF="01toc.html">Main Document Directory</a>). 
<A HREF="10sumtbls.html">Summary Tables</a> list the participating <A HREF="../../amip/AMIP1/modeling_groups.html">modeling groups</a> and <A HREF="../../amip/AMIP1/subprojects.html">diagnostic subprojects</a>, and provide an overview of the major differences among the AMIP models. The user may glean more detailed information on the features of particular models from the respective summary reports. Additional details on algorithms and parameterizations may be obtained by consulting cited references that are listed in the model summary reports as well as in a 
<A HREF="38refs.html">comprehensive bibliography</a>. A 
<A HREF="07acron.html">glossary of acronyms</a> is also provided. The numerous hyperlinks that have been included can be utilized to readily access information at whatever level of complexity is desired.
<p>
Users are encouraged to report any technical problems (e.g., broken hyperlinks) or errors of content in the present summary documentation to:
