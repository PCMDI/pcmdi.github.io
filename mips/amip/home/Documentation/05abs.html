This hypertext document summarizes essential features of the global atmospheric models that are participating in the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP), an international effort to simulate the climate of the period 1979-1988 with common ocean boundary conditions and radiative forcings. Salient features of the AMIP models are summarized in tabular form, and the principal numerical, dynamical, and physical properties of each model are described in greater detail as well. An extensive bibliography of references on the algorithms and parametrizations used in the AMIP models is also provided.  (See the <a href="02preface.html">Preface</a> for a somewhat more detailed overview of this hypertext document.)
