Rita Anderson, Michael Br&ouml;sius, and Robert Lormand provided invaluable technical assistance in producing this hypertext summary documentation. In its earlier manifestation as a hardcopy report, Jay Cherniak, Elaine Price, and W. Lawrence Gates supplied considerable editorial guidance, while Christine Royce and Anna McCravy contributed substantial clerical support. This summary documentation also would not have been possible without the cooperation of representatives of the AMIP modeling groups, who supplied numerous details on model properties and verified the accuracy of the information.
