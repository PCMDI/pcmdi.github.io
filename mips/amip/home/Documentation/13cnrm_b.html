Model CNRM ARPEGE Cy11 (T42 L30) 1995</H2>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC3"></A>Model Designation</H3>
CNRM ARPEGE Cy11 (T42 L30) 1995
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC4"></A>Model Lineage</H3>
The model is a version (Cycle 11) of the ARPEGE climate model, which is
designed for use by the French climate community. (ARPEGE is the acronym
for Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle: Research Project
on Small and Large Scales.) ARPEGE is the successor to the <A HREF="13cnrm_ToC.html">EMERAUDE
baseline model</A>, and differs substantially in its numerics (especially
the <A HREF="#RTFToC7">horizontal representation</A>), as well as in the
formulation of <A HREF="#RTFToC20">horizontal diffusion</A>, <A HREF="#RTFToC21">gravity-wave
drag</A>, <A HREF="#RTFToC26">cloud formation</A>, and <A HREF="#RTFToC35">land
surface</A> schemes.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC5"></A>Model Documentation</H3>
The ARPEGE Cycle 11 model is described by Deque and Piedelievre (1995)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn34">[35]</A>,
with reference to documentation of an earlier version of the model by Deque
et al. (1994)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn32">[33]</A>. The model's <A HREF="#RTFToC7">horizontal
representation</A> is discussed by Hortal and Simmons (1991)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn35">[36]</A>
and by Courtier and Geleyn (1988)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn33">[34]</A>.
<A HREF="#RTFToC35">Land surface processes</A> are represented by the scheme
of Noihlan and Planton (1989)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn36">[37]</A> which
was implemented in the ARPEGE model by Mahfouf et al. (1995)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn37">[38]</A>.
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC6"></A>Numerical/Computational Properties</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC7"></A>Horizontal Representation</H3>
As in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC7">baseline model</A>, the horizontal
representation is spectral (spherical harmonic basis functions) with transformation
to a Gaussian grid for calculation of nonlinear quantities and some physics.
However, in the repeated AMIP integration with the ARPEGE Cy11 model, the
Gaussian grid is reduced longitudinally near the poles so that its <A HREF="#RTFToC8">horizontal
resolution</A> is everywhere approximately the same (cf. Hortal and Simmons
(1991)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn35">[36]</A>). (The ARPEGE Cy11 model is
coded so that the spectral basis functions may be mapped conformally from
the geographical sphere to a transformed sphere with a different pole,
while preserving local horizontal derivatives to within a latitude-dependent
mapping factor <B>m</B>. That is, the effective resolution of the model
may be varied, and the center of highest resolution may be located at any
geographical point--cf. Courtier and Geleyn 1988<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn33">[34]</A>.
<I>However, the option of using these stretched and rotated coordinates
was not exercised in the repeated AMIP integration</I>.)
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC8"></A>Horizontal Resolution</H3>
Spectral triangular 42 (T42), but with transformation to a reduced Gaussian
grid such that its resolution is everywhere approximately 300 km (cf. Hortal
and Simmons (1991)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn35">[36]</A>). The reduced
grid resulted in a savings of about 20 percent in <A HREF="#RTFToC13">computation
time</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC12"></A>Computer/Operating System</H3>
The repeated AMIP simulation was run on a Cray 2 computer using 4 processors
in a UNICOS environment.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC13"></A>Computational Performance</H3>
For the repeated AMIP experiment, approximately 12 minutes Cray 2 computation
time per simulated day.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC14"></A>Initialization</H3>
For the repeated AMIP simulation, the model was initialized for 1 January
1979 from the climate state obtained after a one-year integration with
climatological sea surface temperatures. The initial conditions for this
precursor integration were obtained from a December 1988 ECMWF analysis
that was interpolated to the model grid.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC16"></A>Smoothing/Filling</H3>
The <A HREF="#RTFToC7">horizontal representation</A> of the ARPEGE model
necessitates use of a vertical moisture borrowing scheme to correct spurious
negative humidities, rather than the horizontal borrowing scheme employed
in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC16">baseline model</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC17"></A>Sampling Frequency</H3>
For the repeated AMIP simulation, the history of selected variables is
written every 6 hours, with a full model history saved at 5-day intervals.
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC18"></A>Dynamical/Physical Properties</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC19"></A>Atmospheric Dynamics</H3>
As in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC19">baseline model</A>, primitive-equation
dynamics are expressed in terms of vorticity and divergence, temperature,
and specific humidity, and the natural logarithm of surface pressure (or,
on option, the surface pressure itself). Also as in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC23">baseline
model</A>, ozone is treated as a prognostic variable. In addition, however,
the nonconservation of atmospheric mass due to moisture sources/sinks (i.e.,
evaporation/precipitation) is accounted for in the ARPEGE model's continuity
equation; inclusion of this effect results in increased tropical rainfall
(cf. Deque and Piedelievre (1995)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn34">[35]</A>).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC20"></A>Diffusion</H3>
A linear del^6 formulation of horizontal diffusion of vorticity, divergence,
temperature, specific humidity, and ozone mixing ratio on constant hybrid
sigma-pressure vertical surfaces replaces the del^4 scheme of the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC20">baseline
model</A>. Below 100 hPa, the diffusivity <B>K</B> increases as (<B>n/N</B>)^6,
where <B>n </B>and <B>N</B> are the meridional and truncation wavenumbers,
respectively (i.e., <B>n</B>&lt;=<B>N</B>=42 at T42 resolution). Above
100 hPa, <B>K</B> increases as the inverse of the pressure, yielding very
strong diffusion in the model stratosphere. In addition, a mesospheric
drag is applied to the model winds and temperatures above 1 hPa: the winds
are relaxed toward zero and temperatures toward those of a standard atmosphere
at these levels. Cf. Deque et al. (1994)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn32">[33]</A>
for further details.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC21"></A>Gravity-wave Drag</H3>
The parameterization of gravity-wave drag is different from that of the
<A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC21">baseline model</A>.
<UL>
<LI>
The gravity-wave stress is assumed to be maximum at the surface, and in
a direction that depends on the (2 x 2) covariance matrix of the unresolved
oragraphy (a measure of the anisotropy of the mountains) as well as on
the mean wind in the planetary boundary layer. The magnitude of the surface
stress is proportional to the product of the air density, the Brunt-Vaisalla
frequency at the surface, the wind speed at the lowest vertical level,
and the root-mean square of the unresolved orography in the direction of
this wind (calculated from the subgrid-scale orographic variance).</LI>

<LI>
At levels above the surface, the gravity-wave stress is assumed to be in
the same direction as the surface stress. The vertically propagating gravity
waves do not interact with the mean flow below a critical level of resonance.
Above this level, their resonant amplification follows the experimental
results of Clark and Peltier (1984)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn38">[39]</A>,
while dissipation proportional to the square of the Froude number also
operates. The gravity waves are trapped and reflected with dissipation
at the vertical level where the Brunt-Vaisalla frequency becomes zero.
Cf. Deque et al. (1994))<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn32">[33]</A> for further
details.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC26"></A>Cloud Formation</H3>
Cloud formation is by the same diagnostic method as is used in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC26">baseline
model</A>, but a different critical humidity profile (humidities above
which cloud forms at different pressure levels) is specified. The 2 empirical
coefficients of the critical profile are tuned to accomplish several objectives:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
to produce generally larger cloud fractions than in the baseline model;</LI>

<LI>
to yield a planetary albedo of about 0.30;</LI>

<LI>
to result in approximate balance of global annual-mean radiation at the
top of the atmosphere.</LI>
</UL>
Cf. Deque and Piedelievre (1995)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn34">[35]</A>
and Deque et al. (1994)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn32">[33]</A> for further
details.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC33"></A>Surface Characteristics</H3>
Surface characteristics of land are different from those of the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC33">baseline
model</A> (cf. Mahfouf et al. (1995)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn37">[38]</A>).
<UL>
<LI>
Primary and secondary vegetation cover and type specified in each grid
box from 13 classes determined by the Manzi and Planton (1994)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn39">[40]</A>
simplification of the Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn40">[41]</A>
dataset. Roughness length, leaf area index (LAI), and minimum stomatal
resistance required by the <A HREF="#RTFToC35">land surface scheme</A>
are specified according to the vegetation class and soil characteristics
of the grid box by blending values associated with the primary and secondary
vegetation weighted in a 3 to 1 ratio, respectively. The coverage and roughness
length of deciduous and cultivated vegetation also undergo a seasonal cycle.
The roughness length includes a contribution from local subgrid-scale orography
as well.</LI>

<LI>
Soil color, column depth (derived from drainage data of Wilson and Henderson-Sellers
(1985)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn40">[41]</A>), and texture (fraction of
sand and clay required by the land <A HREF="#RTFToC35">land surface scheme</A>
obtained from Webb et al. (1991)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn41">[42]</A>
data) also are specified for each grid box. The depth of the <I>active</I>
soil layer required by the land surface scheme is assigned according to
the larger of the vegetation root depth vs the bare-soil depth.</LI>

<LI>
As in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC33">baseline model</A>, surface albedos
are a function of solar zenith angle, but their values are assigned differently.
Albedos over land are prescribed according to vegetation cover (blended
as described above for primary and secondary vegetation types) and soil
color. The chosen albedo values are validated against Earth Radiation Budget
Experiment (ERBE) clear-sky data and METEOSAT data provided by Arino et
al. (1991)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn42">[43]</A>. Surface longwave emissivities
are prescribed in the same manner as in the baseline model.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC34"></A>Surface Fluxes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The model follows the Louis et al. (1981)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn16">[17]</A>
formulation of turbulent surface fluxes, as in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC34">baseline
model</A>, but with roughness lengths for calculation of the momentum flux
over land set 10 times larger than those for the heat flux.</LI>

<LI>
Over land, the surface moisture flux is made up of evaporation from bare
ground and from moisture intercepted by the vegetation canopy, as well
as from transpiration by the foliage according to formulations of the <A HREF="#RTFToC35">land
surface scheme</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC35"></A>Land Surface Processes</H3>
Land surface processes are simulated by the Interactions between Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere
(ISBA) scheme of Noilhan and Planton (1989)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn36">[37]</A>
as implemented in the ARPEGE model by Mahfouf et al. (1995)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn37">[38]</A>.
(Use of ISBA results in less extreme ground temperatures over the summer
continents than in the <A HREF="13cnrm.html#RTFToC35">baseline model</A>.)
<UL>
<LI>
The ISBA scheme includes 5 prognostic variables: surface temperature, mean
surface temperature, surface volumetric water content, mean volumetric
water content, and the water amount intercepted by the vegetation canopy.
The time dependence of the prognostic variables are formulated as force-restore
equations after Deardorff (1978)<A HREF="13cnrm_fn.html#fn12">[13]</A>.</LI>

<LI>
ISBA also requires 7 parameters that are prescribed or derived from other
surface characteristics: the vegetation cover, leaf area index (LAI), minimum
stomatal resistance, surface shortwave albedo, longwave emissivity, active
soil depth, and surface roughness length (see <A HREF="#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>). In addition, climatoligical/equilibrium temperatures
and volumetric water contents, the maximum moisture capacity of the vegetation
canopy, as well as transfer coefficients and restoring time constants are
specified in the prognostic equations.</LI>

<LI>
The turbulent flux of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere includes
direct evaporation from the vegetation canopy and from bare soil, as well
as transpiration by the foliage (see <A HREF="#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</A>).</LI>

<LI>
Transpiration ceases when the soil moisture reaches a specified wilting
point corresponding to a water potential of -15 bar; evaporation occurs
at the potential rate when soil moisture is intermediate between its field
capacity (corresponding to a hydraulic conductivity of 1x10^-4 m/day) and
a saturation value that depends on the soil texture (see <A HREF="#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>). Surface runoff occurs when the saturation value of
soil moisture is exceeded.</LI>
