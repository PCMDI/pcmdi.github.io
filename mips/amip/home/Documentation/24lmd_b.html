LMD LMD6b (3.6x5.6 L11) 1995
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC4">Model Lineage</A></h3>
<P>
Model LMD LMD6b (3.6x5.6 L11) 1995 developed from modifications of the AMIP baseline model <A HREF="24lmd_ToC.html">LMD LMD5 (3.6x5.6 L11) 1991</A>.  Differences include: 
<UL>
<LI> Introduction of a <A HREF="#RTFToC22">diurnal cycle</A> (in addition to the seasonal cycle) in solar radiation.  This also requires  <A HREF="#RTFToC15">higher-frequency calculation</A> of radiative fluxes, provision for diurnal sun-angle dependence in <A HREF="#RTFToC33">ocean albedo</A>, and a somewhat different <A HREF="#RTFToC17">sampling (storage) procedure</A> for surface variables.
<P>
<LI> Inclusion of a <A HREF="#RTFToC35">multilayer soil heat transfer model</A>.  
<P>
<LI> A formulation of <A HREF="#RTFToC19">vertical advection of momentum</A> that ensures angular momentum conservation.
<P>
<LI> Changes in the numerics of <A HREF="#RTFToC7">horizontal advection of moisture</A>.
<P>
<LI> Modifications of the prognostic <A HREF="#RTFToC27">precipitation</A> scheme, which also affects <A HREF="#RTFToC26">cloud-formation</A>. 
<P>
<LI> Changes in the optical properties of clouds which impact their interaction with <A HREF="#RTFToC24">radiation</A>.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, the <A HREF="#RTFToC14">initial conditions</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC12">computational environment</A> of the AMIP integration are different from those of the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC12" >baseline model</A>.    

<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC5">Model Documentation</A></h3>
<P>
Documents that are especially relevant to the LMD6b model include a note on angular momentum conservation by Hourdin (1992)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn33">[34]</A>, a description by Polcher (1994)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn34">[35]</A> of the multilayer soil heat transfer model, and a discussion of the cloud-formation and precipitation schemes by Le Treut et al. (1994)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn35">[36]</A>.
<P>
<h2><a name="RTFToC6">Numerical/Computational Properties</a></h2>
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC7">Horizontal Representation</A></h3>
The semi-upstream horizontal advection scheme for moisture in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC7">baseline model</A> is replaced by a simple upstream scheme in order to avoid unrealistic simulation of clouds and precipitation associated with the former scheme.
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC12">Computer/Operating System</A></h3>
<P>
In contrast to the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC12">baseline model</A>, simulations are performed on an 8-processor Cray C90 (but only using a single processor) in a UNICOS operating environment. 
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC13">Computational Performance</A></h3>
<P>
Use of a more powerful computer than for the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC12">baseline integration</A> yields a <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC13">performance improvement > 200%</A>: about 0.8 minutes of C90 computation time per simulated day. 
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC14">Initialization</A></h3>
<P>
The conditions of atmospheric state, soil temperature/moisture, and snow mass/cover for the start of the repeated AMIP integration on January 1, 1979 are obtained from the conditions of the same variables after integrating companion model <A HREF="24lmd_ToC_c.html">LMD LMD6s (3.6x5.6 L11) 1995</A> with the <A HREF="24lmd_c.html#SECHIBA">SECHIBA</A> land-surface scheme for one year following its <A HREF="24lmd_c.html#RTFToC14"> 1 January 1978 initialization</A>.
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC15">Time Integration Scheme(s)</h3>
<P>
Because of the introduction of a <A HREF="#RTFToC22">diurnal cycle</A>, shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes are recalculated more frequently (every two hours) than in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC15">baseline model</A>.  Fluxes in cloudy regions are computed with cloud optical properties that are updated at each 30-minute physics time step.
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC17">Sampling Frequency</h3>
<P>
For the repeated AMIP experiment, daily mean values of model variables are saved once per 24 hours, as in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC17">baseline model</A>.  However, the daily maxima and minima of <I>surface</I> variables with large intradiurnal fluctuations (e.g., temperature, precipitation, evaporation) also are saved, together with the times of their maxima.
<P>
<h2><a name="RTFToC18">Dynamical/Physical Properties</a></h2>
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC19">Atmospheric Dynamics</a></h3>
<P>
In addition to the dynamical framework of the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC19">baseline model</A>, vertical advection is formulated so as to ensure conservation of angular momentum (cf. Hourdin 1992<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn33">[34]</A>).
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC22">Solar Constant/Cycles
</a></h3>
<P>
In contrast to the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC22">baseline model</A>, a diurnal cycle in solar forcing is simulated in addition to the seasonal cycle.
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC24">Radiation</a></h3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
As in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC24">baseline model</A>, cloud optical thickness and emissivity are determined from the cloud liquid water path <B>W</B> (in kg/m^2), the effective radius <B>r</B> of cloud droplets (in m), and the absorption coefficient <B>k</B> (in m^2/kg); however, the  prognostic cloud liquid water content (LWC)  (and therefore <B>W</B>) as well as <B>r</B> and <B>k</B> are determined differently. 
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
The LWC changes because of the introduction of a different parameterization of <A HREF="#RTFToC27">precipitation</A>.  The effective radius of cloud droplets <B>r</B> is prescribed as 10 x 10^-6 m for warm clouds (with cloud-top temperatures > -10 deg C) and as 30 x 10^-6 m for cold clouds (with cloud-top temperatures < -10 deg C), instead of <B>r</B> being a linear function of cloud liquid water density as in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC24">baseline model</A>.  The absorption constant <B>k</B> is also different for warm and cold clouds: 130 m^2/kg and 70 70 m^2/kg, respectively, rather than a constant 130 m^2/kg, as for all clouds in the baseline model.</LI>
<P>
<LI>
These changes in cloud optical properties result in a general improvement of the simulation of long-wave cloud radiative forcing as compared with Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (<a href="http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/erbe/ASDerbe.html">ERBE</a>) satellite data.  Cf. Le Treut et al. (1994)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn35">[36]</A> for further details.  See also <A HREF="#RTFToC26">Cloud Formation</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC27">Precipitation</A>.  
</UL>
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC26">Cloud Formation</a></h3>
<P>
The scheme for prognostic cloud formation as a function of liquid water content (LWC) is the same as in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC26">baseline model</A>. However, changes in cloud formation result from a different parameterization of <A HREF="#RTFToC27">precipitation</A>.

<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC27">Precipitation</a></h3>
<P>
Instead of specifying a sharp distinction between warm and cold clouds for the prediction of precipitation as in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC27">baseline model</A>, functions that provide for a smoother transition between warm and cold regimes are used.  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
For warm clouds (with cloud-top temperatures > -10 C) the precipitation rate is parameterized after Sundqvist (1981)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn36">[37]</A> as the product of a characteristic precipitation time scale <B>T</B> (value = 5.5 x 10^-4 s^-1), the prognostic cloud liquid water mixing ratio <B>m</B>, and an exponential function of (<B>m</B>/<B>C</B>)^2, where <B>C</B> is a prescribed precipitation threshold value = 2 x 10^-4 kg/kg.  
<P>
<LI>
For cold clouds (with cloud-top temperatures < -10 deg C), the precipitation rate is determined by the ratio of <B>m</B> to a different timescale <B>t</B> = <B>z</B>/<B>v</B>, where  <B>z</B> is the depth  of the vertical layer and <B>v</B> is the terminal velocity  of the water droplets, which is determined as an empirical function of <B>m</B> after Heymsfield and Donner (1990)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn37">[38]</A>.

<P>
<LI>
Because precipitation is the main sink term in the budget of cloud liquid water, these parameterization changes also affect <A HREF="#RTFToC26">cloud formation</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC24">cloud-radiative interactions</A>, both of which depend on cloud liquid water content (LWC).
</UL>
 
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics</a></h3>
<P>
Surface characteristics are treated in the same manner as in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC33">baseline model</A>, except that: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The ocean albedo is dependent on the diurnally and seasonally varying sun angle, which is recalculated at each 30-minute physics time step.  The albedo is prescribed so that at each latitude the integral over a 24-hour day  yields the same value as in the baseline model (with no diurnal cycle).
<P>
<LI> The seasonal variation of the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC33">vegetation</A> (affecting the seasonal land-surface albedo and roughness length) depends on the prognostic <A HREF="#RTFToC35">soil temperature</A>, rather than being prescribed as in the baseline model. (However, when vegetation and snow cover are present, the land-surface albedo is computed in the same manner as in the  <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC33">baseline model</A>.) Cf. Polcher (1994)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn34">[35]</A> for details.
</UL> 
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</a></h3>
<P>


Soil hydrology is simulated with the same "bucket" scheme as in the <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC35">baseline model</A>, but soil thermodynamics is instead determined by a 7-layer heat transfer model.   The 7 layers are of uneven depths and are spaced between 0.02 m and 3.0 m below the surface, providing for resolution of thermal forcing at periods from 0.5 hour to 2 years.  A zero-flux condition is imposed at the model's lower boundary, and the thermal insulation of snow is accounted for at its upper boundary. 
Introduction of the 7-layer model impacts ground temperature, snow mass/melt, and the <A HREF="#RTFToC33">seasonal change</A> in prescribed <A HREF="24lmd.html#RTFToC33">vegetation</A> that is tied to the soil temperature at a depth of 0.4 m. In turn, changes in snow cover and vegetation affect <A HREF="#RTFToC33">the albedo and roughness length over land</A>.  Cf. Polcher (1994)<A HREF="24lmd_fn.html#fn34">[35]</A> for further details.
