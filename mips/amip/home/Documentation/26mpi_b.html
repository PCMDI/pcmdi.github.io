<P>MPI ECHAM4 (T42 L19) 1996 </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC4"></A>Model Lineage </H3>

<P>Model MPI ECHAM4 (T42 L19) 1996 is the fourth in a series of models
developed at MPI that originally derive from cycle 17 of the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. The ECHAM4 model's immediate
predecessor is AMIP baseline model <A HREF="26mpi_ToC.html">MPI ECHAM3
(T42 L19) 1992</A>. The ECHAM4 model differs most sharply from its predecessor
in its treatment of <A HREF="#RTFToC7">transport</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC20">diffusion</A>,
of <A HREF="#RTFToC23">chemistry</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC24">radiation</A>,
and of the <A HREF="#RTFToC28">planetary boundary layer (PBL)</A>. The
parameterizatons of <A HREF="#RTFToC25">convection</A>, <A HREF="#RTFToC26">cloud
formation</A>, and land <A HREF="#RTFToC33">surface characteristics</A>
also have been modified. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC5"></A>Model Documentation </H3>

<P>Much of the literature on the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC5">baseline
model</A> remains relevant. Overall documentation of the ECHAM4 model is
provided by Roeckner et al. (1996)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn51">[52]</A>.
Details of the new semi-Lagrangian transport scheme are given by Williamson
and Rasch (1994)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn56">[57]</A> and Hack et al. (1993)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn57">[58]</A>.
The radiation scheme is documented by Fouquart and Bonnel (1980)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn62">[63]</A>,
Morcrette (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn63">[64]</A>, Giorgetta and Wild
(1995)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn67">[68]</A>, and Rockel et al. (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn16">[17]</A>.
The reformulation of the PBL is after Brinkop and Roeckner (1995)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn58">[59]</A>.
Modification of the convection scheme follows Nordeng (1996)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn71">[72]</A>,
and changes in cloud formation are after Sundqvist et al. (1989)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn72">[73]</A>
and Slingo (1987)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn73">[74]</A>. The new land surface
characteristics are described by Claussen et al. (1994)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn75">[76]</A>,
Patterson (1990)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn78">[79]</A>, and Zobler (1986)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn79">[80]</A>.
Validation of various aspects of the ECHAM4 model is provided by Chen and
Roeckner (1996)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn52">[53]</A>, Chen et al. (1996)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn53">[54]</A>,
Lohmann et al. (1995)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn54">[55]</A>, and Wild et

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC7"></A>Horizontal Representation </H3>

<P>The horizontal representation is as in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC7">baseline
model</A>, except that horizontal advection of water vapor and cloud water
are treated by the shape-preserving semi-Lagrangian transport (SLT) scheme
of Williamson and Rasch (1994)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn56">[57]</A>, with
further details supplied by Hack et al. (1993)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn57">[58]</A>.
Because the SLT scheme is not inherently conservative, mass conservation
is enforced at every time step through a variational adjustment of the
advected variable field which weights the amplitude of the adjustment in
proportion to the advection tendencies and the field itself. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC10"></A>Vertical Representation</H3>

<P>The vertical representation is as in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC10">baseline
model</A>, except that vertical advection of positive definite quantities
is treated by the <A HREF="#RTFToC7">SLT scheme</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC12"></A>Computer/Operating System </H3>

<P>The AMIP simulation was run on a Cray C90 computer using 4 processors
in the UNICOS environment. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC13"></A>Computational Performance </H3>

<P>About 3.5 minutes of Cray C90 computation time per simulated day. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC16"></A>Smoothing/Filling</H3>

<P>Smoothing and filling procedures are the same as for the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC16">baseline
model</A>, except that filling of spurious negative atmospheric moisture
values is obviated by the use of the <A HREF="#RTFToC7">SLT scheme</A>.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC18"></A>Dynamical/Physical Properties </H2>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC20"></A>Diffusion</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In contrast to the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC20">baseline model</A>,
linear tenth-order (del^10) horizontal diffusion is applied to all prognostic
variables below about 150 hPa. In the model stratosphere, the order of
the scheme is reduced incrementally to second-order (del^2) at the upper
two model levels. The horizontal diffusion coefficient is consistent with
a height-invariant damping time scale of 9 hours for the highest resolvable
wave number (n=42). </LI>

<LI>In a departure from the K-theory approach of the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC20">baseline
model</A>, a higher-order closure scheme after Brinkop and Roeckner (1995)
<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn58">[59]</A> is used to compute the vertical diffusion
of momentum, heat, moisture, and cloud water. The eddy diffusion coefficients
are calculated as functions of the square root of the prognostic turbulence
kinetic energy (TKE) and a mixing length which is a function of both stability
and height. Above the PBL, the asymptotic value of the mixing length (cf.
Blackadar 1962<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn59">[60]</A>) is assumed to decrease
exponentially with height, from ~ 300 m to ~ 30 m following Holtslag and
Boville 1993<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn60">[61]</A>). See also <A HREF="#RTFToC28">Planetary
Boundary Layer</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</A>. </LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC23"></A>Chemistry</H3>

<P>Trace constituents including methane, nitrous oxide, and 16 different
CFC's are added to the chemistry of the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC23">baseline
model</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC24"></A>Radiation</H3>

<P>The radiation scheme of the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC24">baseline model</A>
is replaced. Instead, shortwave radiation is treated by the two-stream
method of Fouquart and Bonnell (1980)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn62">[63]</A>,
and longwave radiation by the method of Morcrette (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn63">[64]</A>.
In addition, further changes are made in the treatment of other gaseous
absorbers, continuum absorption by water vapor, and cloud-radiative interactions.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>For clear-sky conditions, shortwave radiation is modeled by a two-stream
formulation in spectral wavelength intervals 0.25-0.68 micron and 0.68-4.0
microns using a photon path distribution method to separate the effects
of scattering and absorption processes. Shortwave absorption by water vapor,
ozone, oxygen, carbon dioxide,methane, and nitrous oxide is included. Rayleigh
scattering by gases and Mie scattering/absorption by aerosols also are
treated. Cf. Fouquart and Bonnell (1980)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn62">[63]</A>
and Morcrette (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn63">[64]</A> for further details.
</LI>

<LI>The clear-sky longwave scheme employs a broad-band flux emissivity
method in six spectral intervals from wavenumbers 0 to 2.820 x 10^5 m^-1.
The Morcrette (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn63">[64]</A> code is extended
to include additional greenhouse gases (i.e., methane, nitrous oxide, and
16 types of CFC's, as well as the 14.6 micron band of ozone (see <A HREF="#RTFToC23">Chemistry</A>).
The respective absorption coefficients are fitted from AFGL<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn64">[65]</A>,
HITRAN91<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn65">[66]</A>, and GEISA<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn66">[67]</A>
spectroscopic data. Based on calculations by Ma and Tipping (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn68">[69]</A>,
1992a<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn69">[70]</A>, 1992b<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn70">[71]</A>),
the formulation of the water vapor continuum has been revised to include
temperature-weighted band averages of e-type absorption and a band-dependent
ratio of (p-e)-type to e-type continuum absorption (cf. Giorgetta and Wild
1995<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn67">[68]</A>). </LI>

<LI>For cloud-radiative interactions, single-scattering properties are
calculated following Rockel et al. (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn16">[17]</A>,
a method that entails high-resolution Mie calculations using idealized
size distributions for both cloud droplets and ice crystals. The averaging
over the required wide spectral ranges is done by weighting with the Planck
function. The single-scattering parameters are expressed as functions of
effective radius <B>r</B> by polynomial fitting of the results for different
<B>r</B>. To account for the non-sphericity of ice crystals the associated
asymmetry factor is reduced to ~ 0.80 for a wide range of <B>r</B>. The
<B>r</B> values of both cloud droplets and ice crystals are parameterized
in terms of prognostic liquid and ice water content (see <A HREF="#RTFToC26">Cloud
Formation</A>). As in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC24">baseline model</A>,
radiative fluxes are calculated assuming that clouds of different types
are randomly overlapped in the vertical, while convective cloud and nonconvective
cloud of the same type in adjacent layers are treated as fully overlapped.
</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC25"></A>Convection</H3>

<P>The Tiedtke (1989)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn21">[22]</A> convection scheme
of the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC25">baseline model</A> still is utilized,
but with modifications introduced after Nordeng (1996)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn71">[72]</A>.
Organized entrainment depends on local buoyancy and organized detrainment
is derived for a spectrum of clouds. The detrained cloud water, as well
as that present in shallow non-precipitating cumulus clouds, is made a
source term in the stratiform cloud water transport equation (see <A HREF="#RTFToC26">Cloud
Formation</A>), and buoyancy in updrafts is controlled by the water loading.
The closure assumption of the baseline model also is modified: cloud-base
mass flux is linked to convective instability instead of moisture convergence.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC26"></A>Cloud Formation</H3>

<P>The prognostic cloud-formation scheme of the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC26">baseline
model</A> is modified. Fractional cloudiness is determined as a nonlinear
function of relative humidity excess above a threshold value, following
Sundqvist et al. (1989)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn72">[73]</A>. Threshold
values decrease exponentially with height (between 99% at the surface to
60% in the upper troposphere) after Xu and Krueger (1991)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn27">[28]</A>.
The formation of marine stratocumulus clouds is linked to the existence
of a low-level inversion following Slingo (1987)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn73">[74]</A>.
Cloud water from convective detrainment as well as that contained in non-precipitating
shallow cumulus clouds (see <A HREF="#RTFToC25">Convection</A>) is a source
term for prognostic stratiform cloud formation . The transport and turbulent
diffusion of cloud water also are treated by the SLT and TKE schemes (see
<A HREF="#RTFToC7">Horizontal Representation</A>, <A HREF="#RTFToC20">Diffusion</A>,
and <A HREF="#RTFToC28">Planetary Boundary Layer</A>). See also <A HREF="#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>
for treatment of cloud optical properties.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC28"></A>Planetary Boundary Layer </H3>

<P>The <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC28">baseline model's</A> PBL representation
is replaced by a higher-order closure scheme that computes the turbulent
transfer of momentum, heat, moisture, and cloud water (cf. Brinkop and
Roeckner (1995)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn58">[59]</A>). The eddy diffusion
coefficients are calculated as functions of the square root of the prognostic
turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and a mixing length which is a function
of both stability and height. The TKE is calculated from rate equations
for the respective variables which include buoyancy, dissipation, wind
shear, and vertical diffusion terms, but which neglect TKE advection. The
buoyancy flux is formulated in terms of cloud-conservative variables (see
Cloud Formation in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC26">baseline model</A>).
The boundary condition is expressed as a function of friction velocity
and convective length scale. The asymptotic value of the mixing length
(cf. Blackadar 1962<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn59">[60]</A>) is 300 m within
the PBL, following Holtslag and Boville 1993<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn60">[61]</A>).
See also <A HREF="#RTFToC20">Diffusion</A> and <A HREF="#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC33"></A>Surface Characteristics </H3>

<P>Vegetation parameters, albedos, and roughness lengths differ from those
of the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC33">baseline model</A>: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Fields of leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover, and forest
ratio are constructed by allocating these parameters according to major
ecosystem complexes identified by Olson et al. (1983)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn77">[78]</A>.
The albedos of snow-free land are derived by blending the albedos of these
biome distributions with those obtained from Earth Radiation Budget Experiment
(ERBE) satellite data and from the estimates of Dorman and Sellers (1989)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn74">[75]</A>.
The roughness lengths over land are recalculated to include the new vegetation
and forest covers as well as the effects of subgrid-scale orography and
urbanization, as in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC33">baseline model</A>.
Cf. Claussen et al. (1994)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn75">[76]</A> for further
details. See also <A HREF="#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</A>. </LI>

<LI>In addition, the roughness lengths for computing <A HREF="#RTFToC34">surface
fluxes</A> of heat and moisture over oceans are decreased from those of
the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC33">baseline model</A> in accordance with
experimental data of Large and Pond (1982)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn76">[77]</A>.
</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC34"></A>Surface Fluxes </H3>

<P>As in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC34">baseline model</A>, the turbulent
surface fluxes are formulated as functions of roughness length and moist
bulk Richardson number, but with decreased ocean roughness lengths used
for calculating the heat and moisture fluxes (see <A HREF="#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>). </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC35"></A>Land Surface Processes </H3>

<P>The treatment of land surface processes is the same as in the <A HREF="26mpi.html#RTFToC35">baseline
model</A>, except that the heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and field
capacity for soil moisture are prescribed according to geographically varying
values derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil type distributions
(cf. Patterson (1990)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn78">[79]</A>, and Zobler
(1986)<A HREF="26mpi_fn.html#fn79">[80]</A>). </P>
