Abstract</h3></center>
The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) is an international
effort to determine the systematic climate errors of atmospheric models
under realistic conditions, and calls for the simulation of the climate
of the decade 1979-1988 using the observed monthly-averaged distributions
of sea-surface temperature and sea ice as boundary conditions. Organized
by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) as a contribution
to the World Climate Research Programme, AMIP involves the international
atmospheric modeling community in a major test and intercomparison of model
performance; in addition to an agreed-to set of monthly-averaged output
variables, each of the participating models will generate a daily history
of state. These data will be stored and made available in standard format
by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI)
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Following completion of
the computational phase of AMIP in 1993, emphasis will shift to a series
of diagnostic subprojects, now being planned, for the detailed examination
of model performance and the simulation of specific physical processes
and phenomena. AMIP offers an unprecedented opportunity for the comprehensive
evaluation and validation of current atmospheric models, and is expected
to provide valuable information for model improvement.

<h3>
<a name="Section_1"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
Intercomparison of the results from different atmospheric model integrations
has been carried out since the beginning of large-scale atmospheric modeling
in the 1950s, and is an important part of modeling research. Most such
model intercomparisons have been made in connection with numerical weather
prediction, in which short-term forecasts in selected cases are compared
with one another and with observation. In particular, the Working Group
on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) has organized several such model tests
since the early 1970s in support of the World Climate Research Programme
(and of the earlier Global Atmospheric Research Programme). In the area
of climate, however, fewer such tests have been carried out, due in part
to the greater computational resources required and in part to the lack
of a clear experimental strategy. Among the first juxtapositions of the
results of atmospheric climate models was that given in the report of the
U.S. GARP Committee's Panel on Climatic Variation (National Academy of
Sciences, 1975) and in the subsequent compilation of the zonally-averaged
monthly mean sea-level pressure and precipitation of then-current atmospheric
climate models (Gates, 1975, 1987).

<p>The recent intercomparisons of the performance of atmospheric models
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with climatological
sea-surface temperatures (Gates et al., 1990, 1992) show that although
there is continuing disagreement among current models (and between models
and the corresponding observations), there has been an overall narrowing
of the range of model results and a reduction in the models' systematic
errors as a whole. A compilation of model systematic errors in the seasonal
mean sea-level pressure, temperature, zonal wind and precipitation as simulated
by 14 atmospheric models has also recently been completed under WGNE auspices
(Boer et al., 1991, 1992). In this study it was found, for example, that
a large-scale error common to all current atmospheric GCMs is colder than
observed air in the lower troposphere in the tropics and in the upper troposphere
in higher latitudes. A corresponding WGNE study of extended-range predictions
with 8 atmospheric models shows a similar common error (Bourke et al.,
1991).

<a name="Section_2"></a>2. AMIP background and purpose</h3>
The recent intercomparisons of the performance of atmospheric models by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with climatological
sea-surface temperatures (Gates et al., 1990, 1992) show that although
there is continuing disagreement among current models (and between models
and the corresponding observations), there has been an overall narrowing
of the range of model results and a reduction in the models' systematic
errors as a whole. A compilation of model systematic errors in the seasonal
mean sea-level pressure, temperature, zonal wind and precipitation as simulated
by 14 atmospheric models has also recently been completed under WGNE auspices
(Boer et al., 1991, 1992). In this study it was found, for example, that
a large-scale error common to all current atmospheric GCMs is colder than
observed air in the lower troposphere in the tropics and in the upper troposphere
in higher latitudes. A corresponding WGNE study of extended-range predictions
with 8 atmospheric models shows a similar common error (Bourke et al.,
1991).

<p>The basic purpose of AMIP is to undertake the systematic intercomparison
and validation of the performance of atmospheric GCMs on seasonal and interannual
time scales under as realistic conditions as possible, and to support the
in-depth diagnosis and interpretation of the model results. In particular,
the simulation of the mean climate and the sequence of shorter-term climatic
states, and the simulation of specific atmospheric processes and phenomena
are of interest to both the climate and weather prediction communities.
Such analyses and intercomparisons require that all models simulate the
same time period under comparable experimental conditions, and that the
same diagnostic measures of performance be calculated for all models. As
simple as it sounds, the decision to undertake such a structured or standardized
simulation is a major step forward in climate model intercomparison. In
terms of the WGNE's definitions of model intercomparison shown in <a href="Fig_1.html">Figure
1</a>, AMIP is a level 2 intercomparison in which the models' climate is
specifically generated for the purpose of intercomparison, in contrast
to model intercomparisons in which results are taken from uncoordinated
and possibly disparate runs (i.e., level 1 intercomparisons). An earlier
example of a level 2 diagnostic intercomparison is that of Cess et al.
(1989), while the reports of Boer et al. (1991) and Neelin et al. (1992)
are examples of level 1 model intercomparisons.

<h3>
<a name="Section_3"></a>3. AMIP experimental plan</h3>
The decade 1979-1988 was selected as the AMIP test period. This choice
was a compromise between the desire to use as long a simulation period
as possible in order to obtain representative results, and the increasing
difficulties with observed global data sets as one proceeds to earlier
years. This time period includes the FGGE observational year 1979 and the
occurrence of the major ENSO event during 1982/3. Satellite observations
also become increasingly available during this period. Realistic atmospheric
forcing is sought by specifying the global distribution of the sea-surface
temperature and sea ice in terms of the observed monthly averages on a
2 latitude-longitude grid, from which the appropriate spatial and temporal
interpolations can be made for each model. A data set meeting these requirements
was specifically constructed for AMIP by the NOAA Climate Analysis Center
in cooperation with the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions at
the University of Maryland. An edited version of this AMIP SST and sea-ice
data set is available from PCMDI, and has been distributed to AMIP participants.
These data are illustrated for the month of September 1982 in <a href="Fig_2.html">Figure
2</a>. The sequence of 120 monthly mean observed SST and sea-ice distributions
during 1979-1988 provides realistic forcing for (and constraint on) the
atmosphere, and constitutes a "perfect" ocean for the purposes of AMIP.

<p>Atmospheric GCMs represent the land surface character and its behavior
in a wide variety of ways, including the possible interaction with vegetation.
In order to keep the AMIP specifications as simple as possible, it was
decided to make no common specification of the land surface. Thus, over
land (as determined by each model's land-sea distribution) surface properties
such as the albedo, emissivity, roughness, soil moisture and snow/ice cover,
and the possible effects of surface vegetation, are left entirely up to
each modeling group. (The validation and intercomparison of land surface
parameterization schemes in atmospheric models is being undertaken by the
joint WGNE/GEWEX project PILPS (Henderson-Sellers, 1992). Neither has any
attempt been made to use common surface elevation data or to specify the
values of geophysical constants such as gravity and the orbital parameters,
although standard values of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
(345 ppm) and solar constant (1365 W/m^2) have been specified; these values
are close to the averages observed during the AMIP period.

</p><p>The initial conditions for the AMIP integrations beginning on 1 January
1979 were also not specified since these would presumably have no significant
effect beyond the first month. The atmospheric forecast models in AMIP
generally use an operational analysis for 1 January 1979 as initial AMIP
conditions, while most of the atmospheric climate models use either climatological
January conditions or the results of earlier model runs appropriate for
January. In any case, the integrations are carried out over the 3653-day
period 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1988, inclusive.

</p><p>A common list of standard monthly-averaged output has been established
as shown in the <a href="Table_1.html">Table</a>. Set 1 consists of the
monthly mean global geographical distributions of selected surface and
vertically integrated variables (sea-level pressure, ground and surface
air temperature, cloudiness, precipitable water, soil moisture and snow
mass). In addition, the monthly means of selected components of the atmospheric
heat and hydrologic budgets and the surface wind stress are accumulated
at each physics time step in the models' integrations. Set 1 also includes
the monthly mean cloud radiative forcing as found by subtracting the net
outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere in the (artificial) case
without clouds from that in the (normal) case with clouds. Set 2 of the
AMIP standard output consists of the monthly mean global geographical distributions
of selected three-dimensional variables (temperature, geopotential height,
specific humidity, the zonal and meridional wind and the associated stream
function and velocity potential) at the 850, 500 and 200 hPa levels. In
addition, set 2 includes the geographical distributions of the monthly
variance (defined as the variance about the monthly mean of the daily averages
found from 6 hourly values) of all variables in the set, while set 1 includes
the monthly variance of selected variables (sea-level pressure, ground
and surface air temperature). Set 3 of the AMIP standard output consists
of the monthly means of the zonally-averaged distributions of selected
variables in the meridional-vertical plane (temperature, specific and relative
humidity, cloudiness, zonal and meridional wind, and the mean meridional
streamfunction).

</p><p>In anticipation of the use of the AMIP results in a wide variety of
diagnostic studies, some of which may require information not contained
in the monthly averaged standard output sets, each participating modeling
group is requested to generate a 6-hourly history-of-state consisting of
the prognostic variables of the model, along with the 6-hourly sub-totals
of those quantities accumulated for the standard output. For those models
without a diurnal cycle, a once daily history is appropriate.

<h3>
<a name="Section_4"></a>4. AMIP implementation and present status</h3>
As part of its commitment to the implementation of AMIP, the PCMDI with
the support the Environmental Sciences Division of the U.S. Department
of Energy is providing computer time to those atmospheric modeling groups
wishing to run their models' AMIP simulation at LLNL, and is supporting
the visit to Livermore of a representative of each group for that purpose.
In order to manage effectively and to access the standard output and history-of-state
data that are expected to be in archival storage at LLNL, the PCMDI has
developed a data management system (known as the Data Retrieval and Storage
system, DRS) for storing, retrieving and visualizing both model-generated
and observational data. DRS is a file-oriented system of libraries and
utilities that support a machine-independent data file format. These consist
of the DRS Library, which is the programming interface to DRS, and the
PCMDI Graphics package, which is a menu-driven, point-and-click utility
that allows interactive data selection from DRS files and the creation
and manipulation of graphic displays and animations. This software, as
well as interactive utilities that support DRS file browsing and manipulation,
are available to all AMIP participants as well as to other groups engaged
in related studies.

<p>In support of AMIP and the broader interests of the atmospheric modeling
community, PCMDI is developing a computerized database of the properties
of the models participating in AMIP, as a subset of a more comprehensive
information system of the principal historical versions of atmospheric
GCMs. PCMDI is also assembling an observational database for validation
of the AMIP simulations and related diagnostic studies (see <a href="#Section_5">section
5</a>).

</p><p>In testimony to the widespread interest in model validation and intercomparison
in both the forecasting and climate modeling communities, there are presently
<a href="AMIPgroups.html">more than 30 modeling groups</a> participating
in the AMIP, some with multiple model entries. The principal characteristics
of the AMIP models are summarized by <a href="../../projects/modeldoc/">Phillips
et al. (1995)</a>.

</p><p>The horizontal resolution of the models being used for AMIP ranges from
2.5 degrees latitude x 3.75 degrees longitude to about 4 degrees latitude
x 6 degrees longitude among the 12 finite-difference models represented,
and from R15 to R40/T63 among the participating 19 spectral models, while
the number of vertical levels (usually in sigma or hybrid coordinates)
ranges from 2 to 30. Although most models include a diurnal cycle, there
are wide variations in the schemes used in models' parameterization of
radiation, convection, clouds, frictional effects and soil properties.

</p><p>From the monthly-averaged standard output (see <a href="Table_1.html">Table</a>),
the PCMDI, in cooperation with the participating modeling groups, will
undertake the preparation of a series of reports summarizing and intercomparing
the models' results, together with an estimate of the models' systematic
errors on the basis of the observational data bank being assembled for
AMIP model validation (described below). While much important information
on the model's individual and collective performance will be provided by
these statistics, insight into the models' portrayal of specific physical
mechanisms requires a deeper and more revealing diagnosis of the results.

<h3>
<a name="Section_5"></a>5. AMIP diagnostic subprojects</h3>
To promote the advanced or sophisticated diagnosis of the AMIP results,
a series of <a href="AMIPsubprojects.html">diagnostic subprojects</a> is
being undertaken by members of both the climate modeling and climate diagnostics
communities. Each diagnostic subproject is focussed on a particular phenomenological
aspect of the simulations, on a particular physical or dynamical process,
or on model performance in a particular region. Following approval of a
diagnostic subproject proposal by the WGNE AMIP Panel, the <a href="AMIPgroups.html">AMIP
modeling groups</a> are polled as to their willingness to release their
model's data and/or their interest in being more actively involved by providing
the required diagnostics and participating in the analysis.

<p>The PCMDI will assist the diagnostic subprojects in the acquisition
of the required model data from the AMIP standard output and the model
histories (which are expected to be available at LLNL in DRS format), and
will provide computational assistance to the extent feasible. Proposals
for additional AMIP diagnostic subprojects are welcome, and should be sent
to the author as soon as possible.

<h3>
<a name="Section_6"></a>6. Future plans</h3>
After completion of the computational phase of AMIP in 1994, attention
will increasingly focus on the analysis and intercomparison of the results
as discussed above. This diagnostic phase of AMIP is expected to continue
for as long as necessary in order to exploit fully the unique AMIP dataset.
An informal AMIP Newsletter is issued twice each year by PCMDI, in which
summaries of the project's status and other information relevant to AMIP
are given; AMIP Newsletters are available from PCMDI upon request. Depending
upon progress, it is anticipated that an international AMIP scientific
conference will be convened in 1995.

<p>The availability of observational data with which to validate the models'
performance is essential to the success of AMIP. Although data from a wide
variety of sources are currently available, they are generally not for
the specific AMIP decade or in a format readily useful in model validation
and diagnosis. To develop a model-oriented observational database in support
of AMIP, the PCMDI is acquiring gridded global data sets for as many of
the variables in the AMIP standard output and for as many months of the
AMIP period as possible. These data include temperature, geopotential,
wind and relative humidity from both ECMWF and NMC analyses, and the cloudiness,
radiation and precipitation as generated by the WCRP International Satellite
Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the WCRP/NASA Earth Radiation Budget
Experiment (ERBE), and the WCRP Global Precipitation Climatology Project
(GPCP) observational programs, respectively. It is planned to store these
data (and other relevant data that may become available) at PCMDI in uniformly-formatted
DRS files for ease of access and use in connection with AMIP analyses.
It is recognized that when a reanalysis of the period 1979-1988 is performed
with an advanced data assimilation system (as currently under consideration
by both the ECMWF and NMC), it will be possible to generate consistent
observational estimates of the AMIP monthly-averaged standard output variables
as well as a complete history. AMIP therefore provides an important justification
for carrying out such a reanalysis in a timely fashion over the next few
years (Bengtsson and Shukla, 1988).

</p><p>In addition to its obvious and unprecedented value in the comprehensive
validation of the current generation of atmospheric GCMs, the results of
AMIP can serve as a reference for the systematic documentation of model
improvements by the repetition of some or all of the AMIP simulation with
new model versions, and may also provide a useful yardstick for sensitivity
and predictability studies with atmospheric models. AMIP also compliments
the intercomparison of ocean models being undertaken by the WCRP TOGA Numerical
Experimentation Group (D. Anderson and T. Stockdale, personal communication),
and may serve as a prototype for intercomparisons of coupled atmosphere-ocean
GCMs. In the future it may be useful to extend the AMIP period beyond 1988
(and perhaps before 1979), and to repeat the AMIP integrations with improved
boundary conditions as well as with improved models. Independent realizations
of the AMIP integration with different initial conditions have already
been recognized by several modeling groups as an important source of information
on natural variability and climate predictability.

</p><p>AMIP may be regarded as the first "electronic" model intercomparison,
in the sense that its results and diagnoses (along with the corresponding
observed data) will be electronically available for analysis and display.
The greatest obstacle to achieving this goal lies in the development of
efficient techniques for the storage, retrieval and visualization of extremely
large databases. This is a major challenge to the computational sciences
community on whose skills climate modeling studies increasingly depend.
