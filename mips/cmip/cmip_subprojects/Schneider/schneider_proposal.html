<H2>Project Summary</H2>

<P>
The research will investigate the extent to which the 
differences in the higher latitude (especially North Atlantic) 
responses of some of the coupled models in the CMIP2 model 
intercomparison can be related either to forcing from the tropics or 
internal atmospheric dynamics. The experimental procedure will 
be to compare simulations of several of the CMIP2 AGCMs 
(CCM3, ECHAM4, CSIRO) forced by various tropical SST 
distributions, including those taken from observations and 
produced in the CMIP2 integrations. This is a pilot project to test 
the usefulness of the procedure. If the results are promising, we 
will attempt to involve other CMIP2 models and groups.

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
There are substantial differences in the geographical structure 
of the equilibrium response to doubling of CO2, even with the 
simple slab mixed layer ocean. It has been found that the 
difference in the geographical structure of the high latitude 
warming, as well as the difference in the global mean, between two 
of the more extreme models (MRI and CCSR2) in a WGCM model 
intercomparison (LeTreut and McAvaney, 2001) was related to the 
response of the tropical SST. Large high latitude and global mean 
warming was related to large warming in the eastern equatorial 
Pacific, while the low warming in high latitudes and the global 
mean was related to small eastern equatorial Pacific SST warming. 
The difference between coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM versions 
of the same models shows similar characteristics (Noda, 2001, 
private communication). Results from the CMIP2 intercomparison 
show that the CCSR2 model produces stronger tropical warming, 
but also much larger northern hemisphere high latitude warming at 
the time of doubling of CO2 compared to the other models (J. 
Räisänen, 2001, private communication). A mechanism for the 
structure of the tropical SST response to influence the global and 
higher latitude regional sensitivity has been discussed by Schneider 
et al. (1997). Hoerling et al. (2001) demonstrated that SST forcing 
between 30&#176S and 30&#176N probably influences the low frequency 
changes in the NAO.
<P>
From a practical point of view, understanding regional 
differences in the model sensitivity is perhaps even more important 
than the question of global sensitivity differences. The proposed 
work is designed to compare, in a series of controlled simulations, 
how different models respond in the extratropics and higher 
latitudes to potential structures of tropical warming.

<H2>2. Proposed research: Response to tropical warming</H2>
<P>
The geographical distribution of the warming at the time of 
doubling (J. Räisänen, 2001, private communication) shows that 
the 19 CMIP2 the models agree on certain features, such as 
warming in the eastern Pacific and equatorial Atlantic. However, 
the model responses vary widely in the North Atlantic and the 
Southern Ocean. For obvious reasons, it is important to understand 
why the models do not agree in the geographical distribution of 
their responses. The North Atlantic is of special interest to the 
countries of North America and Europe, and we will also be 
particularly interested in this region.
<P>
a) Background experiments 
<P>
There is a line of evidence, including papers cited in the 
introduction, that influences of tropical SST changes on the 
extratropics and higher latitudes could be important in simulating 
and predicting global warming. We have produced an example of 
the feasibility of this influence reduced to its simplest elements, 
using the COLA AGCM (Bengtsson et al., 2001). 50 year 
integrations of a T21 version of the COLA AGCM have been 
performed, forced with [climatological annual cycle of SST] plus 
[a constant in space and time SST anomaly between 10&#176N and 
10&#176S that represents the structure and amplitude of the observed 
trend of SST over the past 50 years]. The SST anomaly will be 
referred to below as the TSSTA (for Tropical SST Anomaly). The 
model winter SLP anomaly is highly significant and resembles to 
the observed 1948-1999 winter SLP trend from the NCEP 
reanalysis. Also of interest is the result from forcing the AGCM 
with the negative of TSSTA. The result in this case is not just the 
negative of the result found with TSSTA. This lack of symmetry 
shows that there is strong nonlinearity in the response to TSSTA 
anomaly, even in a single model. If nonlinearity of the response is 
due to changes in the wave propagation properties of the 
atmosphere, for example, then difference in regional responses 
might be explained by differences in the models' climatological 
mean simulation. The surface heat flux response in the TSSTA 
minus control experiment in a coupled model gives an indication 
of how the SST will tend to respond (in the absence of changes in 
the ocean heat transport and atmospheric feedbacks) to the SST 
forcing outside the forcing region. There are strong regional 
responses to the relatively small TSSTA, order 20 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. Some of 
these responses occur in regions where models agree. Other large 
responses occur in regions where models disagree (e.g. the North 
Atlantic south of Greenland). Differences in the tropical response 
of models to greenhouse forcing could then be responsible for 
differences in the extratropical response.
<P>
b) Proposed experiments
<P>
The proposed experiments use the same technique as those 
performed by Bengtsson et al. (2001). The equilibrium response of 
an AGCM to time-independent SST anomalies superimposed on a 
climatological (periodic) SST will be calculated, using long (order 
50 year) simulations. The AGCMs and the SST distributions will 
vary in the different simulations. The experiments will find to what 
extent the differences in high latitude responses and other regional 
aspects of the CMIP2 coupled models can be explained as intrinsic 
to the manner in which the atmospheric models respond to a 
similar tropical forcing, and to what extent the differences can be 
explained as model-consistent responses originating from different 
tropical forcings. As a pilot project, our experiments will use only 
the AGCMs in a limited model suite (CCM3, ECHAM4, and 
CSIRO). These models were chosen to span the range of global 
sensitivities in CMIP2. At the time of doubling, CCM3 (as part of 
CSM/PCM) has low temperature sensitivity and intermediate 
precipitation sensitivity; ECHAM4 has intermediate temperature 
sensitivity and low precipitation sensitivity; CSIRO has high 
temperature and precipitation sensitivity. The experiments or ones 
suggested by results from this pilot project could in principle be 
done independently by the full set of modeling groups, as an 
AMIP-type (specified SST) intercomparison. 
The experimental procedure is chosen because the signal can 
easily be separated from the noise by simple time means, and 
statistical significance of the signal can be made arbitrarily high by 
extending the length of the simulations. The questions that are 
relevant to the problem of extratropical/tropical coupling and the 
experiments that will be performed to answer them are:
<P>
1. Do the models have a significant extratropical response to 
tropical greenhouse-related SST anomalies? Do the 
responses of different models differ or are they similar?
<P>
The specified SST experiments described in Sec. 2.b will 
be repeated for each AGCM: 50 years with climatological 
annually varying SST, 50 years with TSSTA, and 50 years 
with -1&#215TSSTA.
<P>
2. Are processes internal to the atmospheric models 
responsible for the differences in extratropical SST at time 
of doubling in the CMIP2 experiments?
<P>
50 year simulations of each AGCM will be run forced by 
the time-of-doubled CO2 climatological annual cycle of 
SST averaged over all of the CMIP2 experiments. These 
experiments will also use doubled CO2 concentration in 
the models. The atmospheric circulation and surface heat 
flux (a predictor of SST difference when coupled) will be 
compared. Differences between results produced by the 
different AGCMs with the same forcing are due to 
processes internal to the models.
<P>
3. Is different tropical forcing responsible for differences in 
extratropical SST at time of doubling in the CMIP2 
experiments?
<P>
Experiments as described in the preceding bullet will be 
repeated, but with the time-of-doubled CO2 tropical SST 
of the respective CMIP2 integration for each AGCM 
added. This will provide a measure of the importance of 
the tropical forcing for each model. Additional 
experiments will be carried out using common tropical 
SST anomalies, including the extremes of tropical SST 
found in the full set of CMIP2 cases. Each model will 
have its own response to the tropical forcing. Differences 
between models in this response will be another measure 
of the role of differences internal to the models.
<P>
These experiments should show whether the differences in 
the regional (especially North Atlantic) behavior of the transient 
coupled greenhouse simulations can be attributed to differences in 
the atmospheric response to tropical forcing, to internal differences 
in the models, or to neither. If the response of the three 
atmospheric models is similar in experiments 1 and 2, then internal 
differences in the model are probably not important. If the 
response of  (one or more of) the models to tropical forcing is 
vigorous and can explain differences in the extratropical responses 
in the CMIP2 experiments, then tropical forcing is probably 
important in the explanation. 
<P>
c) Objectives for proposed work and expected significance
<P>
The objective is to design an experimental procedure to 
implicate or rule out the tropical behavior of coupled models as 
being responsible for disagreement between CMIP2 transient 
projections of regional higher latitude climate change (for a limited 
subset of the CMIP2 models). The procedure outlined above will 
be tested using the atmospheric components of three of the coupled 
models. If successful, the procedure could be applied in a full 
model intercomparison. However, this is exploratory research. We 
expect that the procedure may require modification as the research 
progresses. 
<P>
d) CMIP2 data requirements
<P>
Access to the SST data from the control and transient CMIP2 
is required for this project.
