    <div class="indent txt2"> 
        Anyone can browse the CMIP5 model output archive catalogue, but in order to download data you will be required to register (i.e. open an account) (see step 2 below).  Your account will be valid for browsing all data served by the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) — CMIP5 plus much, much more.  Because different restrictions are placed on different datasets served by ESGF, you must also enroll in one of the two “CMIP5 groups” and agree to the terms of use established for CMIP5 (see step 3 below). <br>

                All CMIP5 Model output can be accessed via any one of several websites serving as portals to the ESGF archive.  Note that these portals supersede the old gateways to CMIP3 data and also the ESG “gateways” originally used to access CMIP5 output that were deprecated in September 2012 (e.g., pcmdi3.llnl.gov).  Although nearly a dozen ESGF portals currently exist, the following sites provide the most reliable and complete access to CMIP5 output (as of November 2012):

Those of you already registered to download CMIP5 data (by registering at the now deprecated “gateways” referred to in 2a) may continue to do so without re-registering.  If you are one of these users, your registration has been transferred to the new system, and you have already been assigned a new openID, which is of the form  <b> https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/esgf-idp/openid/[<em>your user name</em>] </b>

Once registered, you are free to access data through any of the portals in the federation. </li>
            <li>
                Portals have registration procedures that are not all identical but are all quite straightforward.  The following registration instructions apply specifically to the PCMDI portal.

    <div class="indent">
        You can search for model output without registering as a user, but in order to download CMIP5 data you must both register (see step 2 above) and also enroll in a CMIP5 “group”.  One way to do this is as follows:

                <li> Login with your OpenID and password. </li>
                <li> Determine which of the two CMIP5 user groups you should belong to: the <em>“research”</em> group or the <em>“commercial”</em> group.  If you subscribe to the <em>“research”</em> group, you will gain access to all the CMIP5 data, but you may use it only for non-commercial educational and research purposes.  If you plan to use the data for other purposes, you should join the <em>“commercial”</em> group, and then you will be given access to output from a subset (about two-thirds) of the models, but your use of it is unrestricted.  The terms of use governing the CMIP5 data are spelled out in 
                    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/mips/cmip5/terms-of-use.html"> Terms of Use</a>.

                <li> Select and attempt to download a file from one of the CMIP5 models designated as available for <em>“unrestricted”</em> use (through ESGF HTTP link in Data Cart after you expand the Dataset, see 5., for example INM-CM4 tas file, click this link <a href="http://aims3.llnl.gov/thredds/fileServer/cmip5_css02_data/cmip5/output1/INM/inmcm4/1pctCO2/day/atmos/day/r1i1p1/tas/1/tas_day_inmcm4_1pctCO2_r1i1p1_20900101-20991231.nc"> tas_day_inmcm4_1pctCO2_r1i1p1_20900101-20991231.nc </a>
                    ).  You will be invited to choose between joining either the <em>“commercial”</em> or <em>“research”</em> group.  Choose the one appropriate for your data usage.  Now you will be able to download data from all models available to the group you joined.    To declare your intended use of the CMIP5 output, click on the “Account” tab at the top of the web page.  Click on <em>“Apply for Group Membership”</em>.  There are a number of ESG member groups that will be listed.  Click on either <em>“CMIP5 Research”</em> or <em>“CMIP5 Commercial”</em>, depending on your intent (as described in 3d above), and then click on <em>“subscribe”</em>.
                </li>
                <li> You next will be asked to read and agree to the terms of use.  If you agree, <span class="red_col">be sure to click on “I accept” before proceeding</span>.

If you are a member of the CMIP5 “commercial” group, and if the message suggests that you join the CMIP5 “research” group, you should decline.

                You can download <em>individual</em> files one at a time by clicking on the blue “download” links in the far right column of the table.

In the usual case, scripts will<em> not</em> execute until you have obtained an appropriate certificate, as described in the next section.  [If you need a certificate, the web page will indicate that you should obtain a certificate.] When you are ready to run your scripts, open a terminal window, check that the script files are designated as executable (if not, “chmod +x <em>filename</em>”), and run your scripts (e.g., “./wget-download.sh”).</div>

    <p class="txt2"><strong> 6. Obtaining a certificate.</strong></p>
    <div class="indent">
        To use wget scripts (described in the previous section) to download your selected files, you will usually need a certificate that attests to your right to access the data.  The certificate will expire after a set period (which will be in the range 12-72 hours, depending on the gateway configuration).  If you are unable to download your data within this period, you will need to acquire a new certificate.  <br><br>
        During this beta-testing phase, you may encounter difficulties in successfully obtaining a certificate.  One requirement is that the recent version of Java should be installed on your system (version 1.5 or higher).   Please report other problems to the help desk listed under item 7 below.
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The download webpage will indicate whether or not you need to obtain a MyProxy certificate, which you can usually get via your browser.  Click on the “Launch MyProxyLogon” link (on the page that also contains the link for downloading the wget script).  [You must be patient here.  At some point you might be asked to reenter your OpenID and/or password.  You may be asked to “allow” the application to be launched, and it may take some time for webstart to begin to execute.]  Eventually, a window should display a text box with your username, the Hostname, and Port.  You should enter your “Passphrase” (i.e., your ESG password), and then click on “Logon”.  [This is a java application that may not work with all browsers -- if it does not open, skip to step b below.  If you get as far as clicking on “download” and then nothing happens after at least a minute or two, then you may have a firewall that is preventing access.  You should consult your systems administrator.] The MyProxyLogon application will assign and store a certificate in a standard location on your computer where your wget script can subsequently access it.  Note that the certificate will remain valid for all wget scripts you run until it expires (after 12 to 72 hours, depending on gateway configuration). </li>
            <li>
                If the <em>MyProxyLogon</em> cannot be launched as described above, you should try the following.  First you should check that you have Java (version 1.5 or higher) correctly installed on your computer.  Next you should check that your browser settings are set to launch Java <em>WebStart</em> applications. If you are unsuccessful in launching MyProxy from your browser, there are other alternatives:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Sometimes (when you need to enter your OpendID), you’ll arrive at a webpage that is blank except for the words “OpenID Login” (plus a header and footer).  If you encounter this problem, you should clear all cookies in your browser and start over.  Sometimes simply closing and reopening your browser also works
