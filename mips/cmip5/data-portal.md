# CMIP5 - Data Access - Data Portal

## CMIP5 (also CMIP3)

The ESGF enterprise system (http://esgf-node.llnl.gov) is the official site for CMIP3/5 model output. The old gateway (http://pcmdi3.llnl.gov) and [Earth System Grid (ESG)](https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/) are deprecated and now shut down permanently. Please send e-mail to esgf-user@lists.llnl.gov to report bugs and provide feedback.

The CMIP3/5 Data is available through the portal Earth System Grid Federation COG, on the page <http://esgf-node.llnl.gov/>. 

It is highly recommended that you read the User Tutorials and FAQ pages first (linked on the site landing page).

See also [IPCC AR5 timetable](ipcc_ar5_timetable.html) for estimation of due dates for some IPCC"s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) activities.
