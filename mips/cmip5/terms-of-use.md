        <p>
            <i><b>May 2020 update:</b></i> The following modified Terms of Use
            guidance supercedes the <a href="terms-of-use-old.html">original
            Terms of Use</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        All model output in the CMIP5 archive is now available for
        “unrestricted” use, with data usage being conditional on the following
        terms:
        <ol>
        <li>I will hold no individual(s), organization(s), or group(s)Access
        responsible for any errors in the models or in their output data.</li>
        <li>In publications that rely on the CMIP5 model output, I will
        appropriately credit the data providers by an acknowledgment similar
        to the following:</li>
        <ul>
        <li><i>“We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working
        Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we
        thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table XX of this paper)
        for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP the
        U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
        Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of
        software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization
        for Earth System Science Portals.”</i></li>
        <li>Where “Table XX” in your paper should list the models and modeling
        groups that provided the data you used.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I understand that Digital Object Identifiers (DOI’s used, for
        example, in journal citations) are associated with CMIP5 contributing
        model documentation papers, and when available and as appropriate,
        I will cite the appropriate model references in my publications that
        are using these model data.</li>
        <li>I acknowledge the potential limitations of the data obtained from
        the CMIP5 archive. These may include (but are not necessarily limited
        to) errors in the models, shortcomings in the experiment designs, the
        conjectural quality of the forcing scenarios used to drive the models,
        and so on.</li>
        <li>I understand that although the model output has been subjected to
        a quality control procedure, unrecognized errors almost certainly
        remain.</li>
        <li>To aid participating groups in understanding and improving upon
        their models’ behaviors, I will respond to reasonable requests from
        the WGCM for feedback about my CMIP5 research results (e.g., reporting
        model deficiencies, recording CMIP5 publications, etc.).</li>
        <li>Although I may freely share downloaded CMIP5 data with close
        collaborators, I understand that I may not redistribute the data more
        widely without abiding by additional terms of use enumerated below.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
        If you wish to redistribute CMIP5 data to others (beyond your close
        collaborators, please be sure to:
        <ol>
        <li>Ask them to read the above "terms of use" and "acknowledgement"
        statements.</li>
        <li>Inform them that the original CMIP5 data can be accessed through
        the ESGF data portals (see
        <a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/">
        https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/</a> or the project page
