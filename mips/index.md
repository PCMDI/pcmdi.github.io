# Model Intercomparison

#### [AMIP - Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project][AMIP]
AMIP is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs).

#### [CMIP - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project][CMIP]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) studies output from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models that also include interactive sea ice.

#### [CMIP2][CMIP2]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase II

#### [CMIP3][CMIP3]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase III

#### [CMIP5][CMIP5]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase V

#### [CMIP6][CMIP6]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase VI

# obs4MIPs

#### [obs4MIPs][obs4MIPs]
obs4MIPs (Observations for Model Intercomparisons Project) is an activity to make observational products more accessible for climate model intercomparisons

# input4MIPs

#### [input4MIPs][input4MIPs]
input4MIPS (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects) is an activity to make available via ESGF the boundary condition and forcing datasets needed for CMIP6. Various datasets are needed for the pre-industrial control (piControl), AMIP, and historical,  simulations, and additional datasets are needed for many of the <a href="http://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-cmip6-endorsed-mips" target="_blank">CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) experiments</a>. Earlier versions of many of these datasets were used in the <a href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5" target="_blank">5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)</a>
