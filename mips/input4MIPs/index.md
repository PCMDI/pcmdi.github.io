# input4MIPs
input4MIPs (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects) is an activity
to make available via ESGF the boundary condition and forcing datasets needed
for Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs). Various datasets are needed for the
CMIP Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK, see
[Eyring et al., 2016][EyringGMD2016] and [Dunne et al., 2024][DunneGMD2024])
experiments including the pre-industrial control (piControl), amip and
historical experiments.

Work is underway on next-generation forcing datasets to meet the experimental
needs of the upcoming CMIP7 project, with the first data now
[published to the input4MIPs CMIP7 MIP era on ESGF][CMIP7]. For more
information, see [input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io][input4MIPs]. Additional
prototype data are currently available,
[published to the input4MIPs CMIP6Plus MIP era on ESGF][CMIP6Plus].

Earlier versions of forcing data were prepared for the preceding phase, CMIP6,
and were also [published to the input4MIPs CMIP6 MIP era on ESGF][CMIP6], which
include data for the CMIP6 DECK experiments, and additional datasets were
prepared for many of the [CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) experiments][CMIP6EndorsedMIPs].

Earlier versions of many of these datasets were used in the [5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)][CMIP5].
