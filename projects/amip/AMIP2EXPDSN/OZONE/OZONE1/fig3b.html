<p><b>Figure 3. (b) A latitude pressure cross-section of the ozone distribution
for the FUB/KNMI data set for October. In order to be able to present the
entire depth of the atmosphere on a single diagram the logarithm (base
10) is taken of the original data that was in units of parts per million
by volume(ppmv). It is this log data that is plotted on the figure. </b></p>
