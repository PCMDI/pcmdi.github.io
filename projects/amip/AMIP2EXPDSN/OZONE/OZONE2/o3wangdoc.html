<hr width="100%"><p></p>

<p><a name="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>Atmospheric ozone (O<font size=-2>3</font>) absorbs solar radiation,
in particular, the ultraviolet radiation that controls basic biological
processes. It also traps outgoing longwave radiation, thus acting as a
greenhouse gas. The presence of O<font size=-2>3</font> is therefore important
not only to the biological activities on the Earth&iacute;s surface but
also to the radiation budget and climate (Bower and Ward 1982). Ozone observations
have been substantially expanded, especially since the late 1970s when
satellite measurements became available. The atmospheric O<font size=-2>3</font>
distribution has been changing, notably decreases in the lower stratosphere
around the globe and increases in the upper troposphere in the mid-to-high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. These changes can significantly perturb
the radiative forcing and thus modify the Earth-atmosphere climate system
(WMO 1994). General circulation model (GCM) studies have shown that an
accurate O<font size=-2>3</font> representation is required not only to
simulate a realistic present climate but also to study potential climate
responses to O<font size=-2>3</font> changes (Hansen et al. 1993; Wang
et al. 1995; Liang and Wang 1995). </p>

<p>However, the O<font size=-2>3</font> climatologies used in most GCMs
are based on measurements before 1970s and, at the best, limited early
satellite measurements. In general, these climatologies are represented
by latitude-altitude variations of O<font size=-2>3</font> mixing ratio
and/or longitude-latitude distributions of column total ozone amount. Among
the 30 GCMs participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(AMIP; Gate 1992; Phillips 1994), one-third use O<font size=-2>3</font>
latitude-altitude variations that are obtained from a few years&iacute;
ozonesonde observations over North America (Herring and Borden 1965; Dopplick
1974; Wilcox and Belmont 1977). Another one-third include O<font size=-2>3</font>
latitude-altitude variations that are partly derived from satellite measurements
during a short period (D&uuml;tsch 1978; McPeters et al. 1984; Rosenfield
et al. 1987; Keating et al. 1987). For the rest of GCMs, some incorporate
only the observed total ozone distributions (London et al. 1976; Bowman
1988), while others employ simple model prediction or parameterization.
</p>

<p>Recently, we have replaced the zonally symmetric O<font size=-2>3</font>
climatology (D&uuml;tsch 1978) in the SUNYA/NCAR GCM with more contemporary
measurements that include longitudinal variations (Wang et al. 1995). This
new three-dimensional climatology is constructed from long-term records
of TOMS (total ozone mapping spectrometer) and SAGE (stratospheric aerosol
and gas experiment) II satellite data as well as ozonesonde measurements.
The O<font size=-2>3</font> update has been found to substantially ameliorate
regional climate simulations (Wang et al. 1995). In addition, when the
O<font size=-2>3</font> trend estimated from TOMS is imposed upon the new
climatology in the lower stratosphere, the GCM simulates quite realistic
climate responses when compared with observations, in particular, the lower
stratospheric cooling signals that were identified with O<font size=-2>3</font>
depletion during 1979-1992 (Liang and Wang 1995). Since then, many modeling
groups have requested this data set for use in their GCMs. The purpose
of this report is to document in details the construction of the O<font size=-2>3</font>
climatology and its implementation in GCMs. </p>

<p>Below, we first describe the data preparation, which covers the correction
of obvious data biases, the fill-in of missing data, and the merging of
different data sets. As a result, a three-dimensional global, monthly mean
O<font size=-2>3</font> climatology is given. We then provide a procedure
for GCM implementation. Finally we discuss several data problems and outline
future refinements. </p>

<p><a href="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>

<p><a name="Data Sources"></a><b>Data Sources and Preparation</b> </p>

<p>The available measurements are still inadequate to construct a truly
three-dimensional O<font size=-2>3</font> climatology. Although measurements
of total O<font size=-2>3</font> amount are extensive and adequate to provide
geographic distribution on a global basis, information on the O<font size=-2>3</font>
vertical distribution is lacking. The construction of the O<font size=-2>3</font>
climatology therefore involves ad hoc linkages between vertical profiles
and total amounts. </p>

<p><a name="Stratospheric"></a><u>Stratospheric Ozone Profiles</u> </p>

<p>The stratospheric O<font size=-2>3</font> latitude-altitude distribution
is constructed from SAGE II measurements. The raw data were provided in
the GEDEX CD-ROM [USA_NASA_NCDS_GEDEX_004], as released in 1992 by the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The data cover the period October 1984
to November 1989, and the details were described in McCormick (1989). SAGE
II performs 15 sunrise and 15 sunset daily measurements, each separated
by 24.5&deg; in longitude. Because of the satellite orbital inclination,
the SAGE II spatial coverage extends over a latitude range of approximately
80&deg;S to 80&deg;N, which varies with months. The measurement precision
was estimated to be within 7% at all altitudes between 20 and 53 km, degrading
to 20% at 60 km and to 50% at 10 km (Cunnold et al. 1989). </p>

<p>Note that SAGE I measurements is also available for the period February
1979 to November 1981. We however exclude their use because of the existence
of substantial differences between long-term SAGE I and II averages. Cunnold
et al. (1989) indicated that SAGE II profiles are more precise than SAGE
I profiles. In addition, the altitude registration of SAGE I data are now
found to be offset by 300 meters (WMO 1994). Therefore, as suggested by
McCormick et al. (1992), we use here only the SAGE II self-calibrating
instrument data to eliminate uncertainties caused by systematic instrumental
differences. Note also that SAGE II data in the troposphere are biased
due to the presence of clouds (McCormick et al. 1992). Thus, only stratospheric
measurements are adopted here. </p>

<p>We first calculate monthly, zonal mean profiles of O<font size=-2>3</font>
volume mixing ratio from all available SAGE II measurements within 5&deg;
wide latitude bands. These profiles are obtained at the 1 km vertical resolution
(as in the original data) extending over the geometric altitude range of
13.5-60.5 km. The resulting monthly, latitude-altitude distributions are
illustrated in <a href="F1.html">Fig. 1</a>. Three problems are noticed.
First, no data are available over polar regions with the latitudinal extent
a function of particular months. Second, for several mid- and low latitude
bands, data are missing in February, June, August and December. Third,
obvious data biases exist at and around the latitudes where missing data
are found. </p>

<p>The above data problems are resolved as follows. We first eliminate
these edging biases by extrapolation through vertical or meridional gradient
adjustments toward adjacent latitudes and months, which are chosen subjectively.
Then linear interpolations between three successive months are applied
to fill the data gaps in the middle month. Finally subjective extension
to the polar regions is conducted by manual drawing of the contours. Note
that all data treatments are done on the logarithm of O<font size=-2>3</font>
volume mixing ratio to allow better representation of the two orders of
magnitude variations over the computational domain. The analyzed results
are plotted in <a href="F1.html">Fig. 1</a>, overlaying with the raw data
distributions for comparison. </p>

<p><a href="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>

<p><a name="Tropospheric"></a><u>Tropospheric Ozone and Upper Boundary
Condition</u> </p>

<p>The tropospheric O<font size=-2>3</font> latitude-altitude distribution
was provided by J.A. Logan of Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
This data set is based on measurements from more than 40 ozonesonde and
surface stations. The data periods range from 4 to 18 years during 1963-1984.
(Logan 1985; Oltmans and Komhyr 1986; Spivakovsky et al. 1990). The monthly
mean O<font size=-2>3</font> volume mixing ratios are given at a latitude
resolution of 15&deg; for 75&deg;S-15&deg;N and 7.5&deg; for 15&deg;N-75&deg;N.
For most latitude bands, data are available at 1000, 700, 500, 300, 200,
150, 100 hPa pressure levels. At 22.5&deg;N and 15&deg;S, additional data
are presented at 900, 800, 850 and 70 hPa levels. In the equator, only
the annual mean values are supplied and assumed to be the same for all
months. Values at higher latitudes are set equal to values at 75&deg;.
Note that measurements are sparse for the tropics and Southern Hemisphere.
</p>

<p>To be consistent, the tropospheric data are interpolated to the same
computational grids as for the SAGE II analysis, i.e., with the resolution
of 5&deg; in latitude and 1 km in altitude. The lowest pressure level (1000
hPa) data, however, are maintained. Again, the interpolations are done
on logarithm of O<font size=-2>3</font> volume mixing ratio, which is assumed
to depend linearly on both latitude and altitude. The altitude versus pressure
conversion is made according to the US-1976 Standard Atmosphere (see next
section). </p>

<p>As indicated above, the SAGE II profiles provide useful stratospheric
O<font size=-2>3</font> information up to approximately 60 km. Above this
level, we assume that the logarithm of O<font size=-2>3</font> volume mixing
ratio is a linear function of altitude. To complete the extrapolation,
a top boundary condition is specified according to the AFGL standard O<font size=-2>3</font>
profiles (McClatchey et al. 1971). The O<font size=-2>3</font> volume mixing
ratio at 98.5 km (~0.0003 hPa) is set to 0.0521105 ppmv for all latitudes
and months. </p>

<p><a href="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>

<p><a name="Column"></a><u>Column Total Ozone Distribution</u> </p>

<p>The geographic distribution of column total O<font size=-2>3</font>
amount is represented by TOMS measurements. The raw data were based on
the version 6 algorithm and provided in the CD-ROMs [USA_NASA_UARP_OPT_001
to 003] by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as released in December
1990, July 1991 and April 1992. The data cover the period November 1978
to January 1992 and are given as monthly mean gridded values at a resolution
of 1.25&deg; longitude by 1&deg; latitude. The measurement details were
documented in McPeters et al. (1993). The measurement precision was estimated
to be 2 % or better (Bhartia et al. 1984; Bojkov et al. 1988). The version
6 data have corrected the calibration drift of the TOMS instrument (McPeters
and Komhyr 1991; Herman et al. 1991; Stolarski et al. 1991). </p>

<p>Since the TOMS instrument measures backscattered solar radiation, no
data are available at polar night (Bowman and Krueger 1985). Thus, a special
treatment is needed to fill these data gaps. First, the individual, monthly
mean series of raw data contour maps are examined to determine additional
latitude bands near the boundaries of missing values. Contours over these
bands are substantially noisy and differ from those over the interior data
domain. This is likely caused by insufficient samples that were used to
produce monthly means over these areas. For the interior data domain, a
linear longitudinal interpolation is then applied to obtain values for
the few places with missing data. Analyses of the temporal variations of
zonal means show that, for each year, the measurements over the north polar
regions start and end almost at the maximum and minimum of the column O<font size=-2>3</font>
annual cycle <a href="F2.html">(Fig. 2)</a>. This characteristic allows
us to develop the following simple but efficient procedure to fill the
missing values. </p>

<p>First, the time series of the zonal mean at 89.5&deg;N are linearly
interpolated to eliminate missing data months. For the first and last years
of records, extrapolation is done such that their seasonal variations follow
the adjacent year but with the cycle amplitude their own. This continuous
data series is assigned to the north pole at 90&deg;N, where no longitudinal
variation occurs. The remaining gaps are then filled, for each month, by
a linear latitude interpolation between the north pole value and those
at corresponding longitudes along the nearest latitude circle where data
are available. The satisfaction of this procedure can be visualized from
<a href="F2.html">Fig. 2</a>, where the resulting time series of zonal means
at 89.5&deg;N, 80.5&deg;N and 70.5&deg;N are illustrated along with the
raw data, as well as the 60.5&deg;N series for reference. The same procedure
is applied for data gaps near the south pole. The performance however is
not as good because the annual cycle minima were not measured. Nevertheless,
temporal variations at 80.5&deg;S and equatorward are well reproduced (Fig.
2). In addition, the geographic distributions of our analyzed total O<font size=-2>3</font>
amount over northern high latitudes agree well with GO<font size=-2>3</font>OS
(global ozone observing system) ground-based observations during the overlap
period November 1991 to January 1992 (WMO 1993). </p>

<p>Given the above procedure, global monthly distributions of long-term
averaged climatology and linear trend can be archived using the analyzed
data that continued from November 1978 through January 1992. <a href="F3.html">Figure
3</a> depicts seasonal variations of the zonal mean climatology and trend
of total O<font size=-2>3</font> amount. For comparison, corresponding
results derived from the raw data are also shown. </p>

<p><a name="Composite"></a><b>Composite 3-D O<font size=-2>3</font> Climatology</b>
</p>

<p>We now combine the analyzed data sets to construct a three-dimensional
O<font size=-2>3</font> climatology for a given GCM longitude-latitude
grid mesh designated by <img src="IMG00057.gif" height=24 width=49>.
First, the SAGE II stratospheric profiles are merged with the tropospheric
soundings and the prescribed upper boundary extrapolation to produce a
unique latitude-altitude structure of O<font size=-2>3</font> volume mixing
ratio. The merging levels are specified at 16.5 and 57.5 km, respectively.
A smooth transition is ensured by invoking a log-linear altitude interpolation
between the SAGE II at 15.5 km and the tropospheric soundings at 12 km,
although the latter have data up to 16.3-18.5 km (100-70 hPa). This unified
set, which carries data from 90&deg;S to 90&deg;N with a 5&deg; interval,
is linearly interpolated in latitude into the GCM grid mesh. As a result,
the outputs are given at the GCM grid latitudes and 1-km-interval vertical
levels. We denote this product as <img src="IMG00058.gif" height=24 width=61>.
Second, the analyzed TOMS data at the 1.25&deg;x1&deg; resolution are interpolated
linearly both in longitude and latitude to obtain GCM gridded total O<font size=-2>3</font>
amount distribution <img src="IMG00059.gif" height=24 width=74>.
The final local O<font size=-2>3</font> volume mixing ratio <img src="IMG00060.gif" height=24 width=78>
is composited from the adjustment of the vertical profile <img src="IMG00061.gif" height=24 width=61>
toward a correct column total amount <img src="IMG00062.gif" height=24 width=74>:
</p>

<center><p><img src="IMG00063.gif" height=67 width=284>
(1) </p></center>

<p>where <img src="IMG00064.gif" height=19 width=16>
is the local air density <img src="IMG00065.gif" height=24 width=64>,
<img src="IMG00066.gif" height=25 width=19>
is the surface elevation <img src="IMG00067.gif" height=24 width=49>,
<img src="IMG00068.gif" height=26 width=23>
is the volume of an ideal gas at STP (standard temperature and pressure
at the sea level), and <img src="IMG00069.gif" height=17 width=24>
is the mean molecular weight of air. The vertical integration is over the
entire atmosphere column, where <img src="IMG00070.gif" height=24 width=61>
values outside of the data altitude domain 0.118-98.5 km are assumed by
homogeneous extension. Thus, at each <img src="IMG00071.gif" height=24 width=49>
grid point, the vertical profile maintains a zonally symmetric shape while
its amplitude is scaled to adjust the column total amount toward the TOMS
data. </p>

<p>So far we present the vertical O<font size=-2>3</font> variations as
a function of geometric altitude. For use in GCMs, it is preferred to invoke
a pressure dependence. Without the instantaneous atmospheric temperature
structure, the actual geometric altitude in unknown. For reference, we
adopt the altitude versus pressure conversion that is based on the US-1976
Standard Atmosphere using the analytic representation of Fels (1986). Thus,
we have monthly distributions of <img src="IMG00072.gif" height=24 width=64>
and <img src="IMG00073.gif" height=24 width=74>,
and </p>

<p><a name="GCM"></a><b>GCM Implementation</b> </p>

<p>The most pertinent GCM component that depends on atmospheric ozone is
the radiation process. To compute the absorption in the solar and longwave
radiative transfer parameterizations, ozone path lengths are needed and
usually defined as (Chervin 1986): </p>

<center><p><img src="IMG00084.gif" height=82 width=545>
(3) </p></center>

<p>where <img src="IMG00085.gif" height=26 width=43>
1013.25 hPa is the pressure at STP, and <img src="IMG00086.gif" height=16 width=33>
1 or 2. <img src="IMG00087.gif" height=24 width=87>
is needed for solar absorption, while longwave calculations require both
<img src="IMG00088.gif" height=24 width=87>
and <img src="IMG00089.gif" height=24 width=88>.
For a specific GCM application, we recommend the following procedure to
evaluate Eq. (3). </p>

<p>First, at the beginning of each calendar date, a linear interpolation
between the two nearest months is applied to calculate the representative
<img src="IMG00090.gif" height=24 width=64>
and <img src="IMG00091.gif" height=24 width=74>
distributions for that day. On the data grid mesh, two additional quantities
are computed: </p>

<center><p><img src="IMG00092.gif" height=119 width=487>
(4) </p></center>

<p>where <img src="IMG00093.gif" height=25 width=39>
is the pressure at the lower interface of the <img src="IMG00094.gif" height=25 width=69>
data layer that is centered at pressure <img src="IMG00095.gif" height=26 width=21>.
These four fields are saved for subsequent calculations of instantaneous
local ozone path lengths during the entire day. </p>

<p>Second, at each step of radiation calculations, corresponding parameters
at a specific model pressure level <img src="IMG00096.gif" height=26 width=23>
are calculated by </p>

<center><p><img src="IMG00097.gif" height=65 width=391>
(5) </p></center>

<p>where <img src="IMG00098.gif" height=26 width=122>,
and the superscript <img src="IMG00099.gif" height=16 width=21>
denotes for a quantity that is carried on the model pressure levels. The
adjustment of the total O<font size=-2>3</font> amount toward <img src="IMG00100.gif" height=24 width=74>
is represented by the scaling factors: </p>

<center><p><img src="IMG00101.gif" height=65 width=345> (6) </p></center>

<p>Finally, the instantaneous local ozone path lengths are given by </p>

<center><p><img src="IMG00102.gif" height=64 width=309>
(7) </p></center>

<p>Note that the units of <img src="IMG00103.gif" height=25 width=94>
are generally in cm-STP. Through the above procedure, this is realized
as long as <img src="IMG00104.gif" height=24 width=74>
is given in cm-STP and <img src="IMG00105.gif" height=19 width=23>
and <img src="IMG00106.gif" height=24 width=23>
in hPa. </p>

<p><a name="Concluding"></a><b>Concluding Remarks</b> </p>

<p>We have constructed a three-dimensional global, monthly mean O<font size=-2>3</font>
climatology using long-term records of TOMS and SAGE II satellite measurements
together with ozonesonde data. Special efforts have been taken to prepare
this climatology for general use in GCMs. Although it has significantly
improved over the data sets that are prescribed in most of current GCMs,
substantial uncertainties remain. Several issues are discussed below. </p>

<p>First, the latitude-altitude O<font size=-2>3</font> distribution <img src="IMG00107.gif" height=24 width=64>
over polar regions is almost completely obtained by extrapolation, while
the specification of local O<font size=-2>3</font> vertical profiles through
adjustment of <img src="IMG00108.gif" height=24 width=64>
toward correct column total amount <img src="IMG00109.gif" height=24 width=74>
is arbitrary. These however are not likely to be resolved in the near future
due to the data limitation. Second, above 57.5 km, the log-linear altitude
extrapolation toward the AFGL upper boundary condition is questionable.
As Keating et al. (1987) showed, the ultraviolet instrument aboard the
solar mesosphere explorer satellite (Barth et al. 1983) observed O<font size=-2>3</font>
volume mixing ratio minima near 0.02 hPa (approximately 75 km). This has
not been incorporated in the present <img src="IMG00110.gif" height=24 width=64>
climatology. Perhaps the most pertinent problem with the <img src="IMG00111.gif" height=24 width=64>
distribution lies in the vertical domain near the tropopause and in the
troposphere, where scarce and inhomogeneous soundings are used. In particular,
the radiative forcing and the climatic effect of O<font size=-2>3</font>
change indicate the greatest sensitivity in the vicinity of the tropopause
(Wang et al. 1980; Lacis et al. 1990), which is just at the transition
level from direct sounding to satellite data. Third, the <img src="IMG00112.gif" height=24 width=74>
climatology includes the perturbations caused by the eruption of the El
Chichon in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 as well as the systematic measurement
biases due to a failure of the TOMS instrument from May 1991 onward (WMO
1994). All of these may affect the representativeness of the climatology.
</p>

<p>It is therefore important to continue refinements using more contemporary
measurements. Recently, comprehensive and long-term records of high quality
ozonesonde data have been archived (Logan 1994; Bojkov et al. 1995). The
TOMS version 7 data set of total O<font size=-2>3</font> amount is now
available, which extends the record period from November 1979 through April
1993 and have corrected several version 6 biases (McPeters et al. 1996).
Currently, Earth Probe TOMS and ADEOS TOMS provide near real-time total
O<font size=-2>3</font> amount data. Meanwhile, the SAGE II O<font size=-2>3</font>
profile measurements continue to the present. In addition, the scheduled
SAGE III lunch in 1998 will augment such measurements and resolve the O<font size=-2>3</font>
vertical structure up to 85 km. Appropriate processing and the merging
of all these data sets are warranted to construct an improved O<font size=-2>3</font>
climatology. </p>
