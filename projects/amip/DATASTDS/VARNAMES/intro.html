<p>What follows is an overview of the PCMDI strategy to establish "reasonable"
variable names for climate model and observational data.&nbsp; Use of these
naming conventions is strictly adhered to at PCMDI, and will be utilized
for projects managed by PCMDI such as AMIP, CMIP and PMIP. The need for
adherence to these conventions is essential for efficient managment of
AMIP, a project for which PCMDI anticipates receiving over 1Tb of model
output from over 30 modeling groups by the year 2000.

<p>Variable names are created with <a href="#constructs">naming constructs</a>.
The <a href="#varnames">complete listing</a> of PCMDI standard variable
names is fully consistent with the naming constructs, and both are updated
regularly. For convenience, the table of PCMDI standard variable names
also includes standard units and metadata titles used by PCMDI.

<p>This schema has been made public in response to a request made by several
modeling groups. Those who are appreciative of the potential advantages
of developing standards for the community may wish to adopt the PCMDI standards
for their own use. Institutions choosing to collaborate with this effort
should contact PCMDI <a href="mailto: amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov">amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov</a>.
Requests will be taken to continuously add new fields to this list as the
demand arises.

<p>Certain rules and guidelines have been established for the creation
of PCMDI variable names. For example, 1) Keeping the variable names as
short as possible is a high priority, 2) Only basic properties of the variable
should be described, and thus any spatial or temporal averaging (e.g.,
zonal and monthly respectively) is identified by file names, not the variable
names, and 3) The methodology must ensure that the listing of PCMDI standard
variable names can easily be continuously updated. This third criteria
is the most serious constraint given the diversity of categories which
are expected to arise (e.g., from the various sub-models of the atmosphere,
ocean, land surface, trace chemistry, etc.). At PCMDI it has thus been
concluded that constructing variable names in the future will require flexibility
to expand the listing in ways that cannot be anticipated. Thus, many of
the guidelines developed are unique to each <i>variable property</i> (e.g.,
albedo, radiation, temperature, etc.). This enables much more versatility
than attempting to create a comprehensive set of rigid rules that all variable
names must adhere to. On the other hand, a concerted effort is made to
ensure that there is as much consistency as possible throughout the various
variable properties.&nbsp; The variable property is identified by the variable
name <i>prefix</i>. Current prefixes in use are listed in the following
table:
