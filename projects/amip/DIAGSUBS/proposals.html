<h1>Call for AMIP II Diagnostic Subproject
Proposals</h1>
Proposals for the formation of AMIP II diagnostic subprojects are still
being accepted for review by the WGNE AMIP Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp;
many have already been established, and the approval of any new subproject
will be contigent on whether or not they conflict with existing projects.
<p>As in AMIP I, in-depth analysis and intercomparison of the AMIP II simulations
will be be carried out by a diverse community of experts. Scientists with
interest in establishing an offical AMIP II diagnositc subproject should
be familiar with the <a href="../NEWS/amipnl8.html">AMIP
II guidelines</a>, especially the responsibilites of AMIP II diagnostic
subprojects. Approved diagnostic subprojects will have exclusive access
to AMIP II model output for the first two years after it has been placed
in the AMIP archive. There will be no direct funding provided by the AMIP
Project Office to approved diagnostic subprojects.
<p>Proposals should be no more than 1000 words (excluding references),
and include:
<p>1) Short title <a href="../AMIP1/subprojects.html">(examples
from AMIP I)</a>
<p>2) Name and address of proposed subproject leader(s)
<p>3) Background to the intended research
<p>4) Objectives: A clear and concise discussion of the intended diagnostic/intercomparison
study, including justification of its importance
<p>5) Methodology (e.g., specific computations and diagnoses to be made,
sources of validation data to be used)
<p>6) Data requirements: A listing of the variables from the AMIP II Standard
Model Output that are required for the intended study, including specification
of the averaging period (monthly or 6-hourly). Each requested variable
should be justified, particularly the 6-hourly data.
<p>7) References (including a listing of all relevant publications by the
proposed subproject leader(s))
<p>Existing AMIP I diagnositic subprojects must be re-approved if they
are to be continued in AMIP II. The above instructions apply for existing
subprojects, although the proposal can be similar to that accepted in AMIP
I if justification is given for the continuation of the subproject.
<p>Proposals should be sent to the <a href="mailto:amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov">AMIP
Project Office</a> as ascii text (strongly preferred), or by regular mail
to:
<p>AMIP Project Office
