<a name="background"></a><b>Background</b>

<p>The Madden-Julian (Intraseasonal) Oscillation (IO) is a dominant mode
of variability in the tropics (Madden and Julian 1971, 1972). It has long
been recognized that it is manifested on a time scale of ~30-60 days through
large-scale circulation anomalies, which occur in conjunction with eastward
evolving convective anomalies in the tropical eastern hemisphere. Characteristics
of the life cycle of intraseasonal oscillations have been described by
many authors (e.g., Knutson and Weickmann 1987, Rui and Wang 1990, Hendon
and Salby 1994, Matthews and Hoskins 1996, Sperber et al. 1996). The principal
focus of research in Subproject 1 of AMIP I involved the diagnosis and
assessment of the IO in 15 participating AGCMs. The results, described
in Slingo et al. (1996), indicated that:
<ul>1) No model was able to capture the dominance of the intraseasonal
oscillation seen in the ECMWF analyses; the simulated oscillations were
usually weaker and not as spatially coherent as observed; the correct seasonality
was not well reproduced.

<p>2) Buoyancy closure of a convection scheme may be preferable to moisture
convergence for the simulation of intraseasonal oscillations. Models with
the most realistic intraseasonal oscillations appeared to have precipitation
distributions which were well correlated with warm sea surface temperatures.

<p>3) Those models with weak intraseasonal activity tended also to have
a weak seasonal cycle; an accurate description of the basic climate may
be a prerequisite for producing a realistic intraseasonal oscillation.</ul>
Following the basic assessment of 15 AGCMs, Sperber et al. (1996) analyzed
case study periods from two of the models that produced the most realistic
IO's to investigate the initiation and propagation of the IO and the potential
mechanisms involved. The model results were compared with a similar diagnosis
of NCEP/NCAR reanalyses. This study indicated that:
<ul>1) The models were unable to simulate the large scale organization
of convection associated with the IO and its eastward migration from the
Indian Ocean into the western Pacific. Rather, the simulated convection
and latent heat flux tended to lock onto the west Pacific warmpool.

<p>2) Evaporative wind feedback and frictional wave-CISK are not the principal
mechanisms for maintaining eastward propagation of the IO in either the
NCEP/NCAR reanalyses or in the models.

<p>3) Sea surface temperatures display intraseasonal variability which
may interact coherently with the IO and thus may play a role in its initiation
and propagation.</ul>
The results from AMIP I show that a realistic simulation of the IO has
yet to be achieved. The nature of the IO, particularly its periodicity,
its seasonality and its sporadic occurrence, has still to be unraveled.
However, Slingo et al. (1996) and Sperber et al. (1996) have demonstrated
the considerable benefits and advances in understanding that can be achieved
through inter- comparison of models and validation against reanalyses.

<p><a name="objectives"></a><b>Objectives</b>

<p>As in Subproject 1 of AMIP I, the IO will continue to be a focus of
research. However, with improved availability of model history data, more
emphasis will be placed on the synoptic timescale and its interaction with
the IO. The main emphasis will continue to be on the coherent eastward
propagating IO which occurs predominantly during northern winter. The intraseasonal
activity during northern summer, which is characterised by northward propagation
and is closely linked to Asian summer monsoon active/break periods, will
be studied in a related subproject. Specifically, we plan to:

<p>1) Provide a continuing assessment of the skill of participating models
to simulate the IO, including its seasonality and interannual variability.

<p>2) Investigate further the processes responsible for the initiation,
maintenance, and dissipation of the IO.

<p>3) Assess the reproducibility of the interannual behaviour of the IO
and its relationship with ENSO.

<p>4) Investigate the interdependence of the multiple time scale interactions
in the tropics (e.g., cloud clusters and super cloud clusters, westerly
wind bursts); to explore tropical-extratropical interactions which may
affect, or be affected by the IO (e.g., cold surges).

<p>5) Investigate the impact of intraseasonal variability in modulating
the seasonal progression and interannual fluctuations of the Austral Monsoon.
It is hypothesized that the intensity, frequency and duration of active
and break periods associated with the IO may be important modulators of
the intensity of the monsoon.

<p><a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology and Validation</b>

<p>Preliminary identification of IO will be made from analyzing hovmoller
diagrams of 200hPa velocity potential. The velocity potential is the field
in which the IO is most readily identified. The forced Rossby wave response
and the vertical structure of the IO will investigated using eddy streamfunction
at 200hPa, 850hPa and the surface. Bandpass filtering, Fourier analysis,
space-time decomposition and empirical orthogonal function analysis will
be used to identify the characteristics of the IO. Use of wavelet analysis
may facilitate diagnosis of the interdependence of the multiple time and
space scales of convection.

<p>The life-cycle of the IO will be studied from a statistical point of
view via lagged correlation analysis with OLR, precipitation (indicative
of diabatic heating), vertical motion at 500hPa, clouds, and surface latent,
shortwave, longwave and sensible heat fluxes. Specific case studies will
be analyzed in detail to understand the surface energy budget for comparison
against TOGA/COARE observations (Zhang 1996, Lau and Sui 1996, and Flatau
et al. 1996) and reanalysis. In this way we will be able to investigate
the mechanisms by which the models initiate and maintain the eastward propagation
of the IO.

<p>Extensive use of the NCEP and ECMWF reanalysis data sets will be made
in order to assess the ability of the AMIP-II models to simulate IO variability.
The degree of agreement among these reanalysis products will provide a
measure of observational uncertainty against which the model performance
can be interpreted. We will use the AMIP-I integrations as a baseline against
which model improvement can be judged so that we may assess our understanding
of the physical processes that may be important for IO simulation.

<p><a name="data"></a><b>Data requirements</b>

<p>Extensive use of the 6-hourly data will be made, particularly from those
models for which the Table 6 6-hourly supplementary output is available
(only with the data from Table 6 can we probe mechanisms of IO variability,
for those models that do not supply this optional data, only the basic
characteristics of the IO can be identified). From Tables 3 and 6 we require:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>u- and v-wind component at 200hPa, 850hPa and the surface (from which
divergence, relative vorticity, streamfunction and velocity potential can
be calculated)
<br>vertical motion at 500hPa
<br>Outgoing longwave radiation
<br>surface downwelling longwave radiation
<br>surface upwelling longwave radiation
<br>surface incident shortwave
<br>surface reflected shortwave radiation
<br>surface sensible heat flux and surface latent heat flux
<br>total precipitation rate
<br>precipitable water
<br>total cloud cover</ul>
Evaluation of the basic state of the models is important to establish the
context within which the IO variations are embedded. Therefore, monthly
mean output for the afore-mentioned variables will be required (Tables
1 and 2). Additionally, upper-air data on the WMO standard levels will
be required for the: temperature tendency due to total diabatic heating,
temperature tendency due to SW radiation, temperature tendency due to LW
radiation, temperature tendency due to moist convective processes, temperature
tendency due to dry convective processes, temperature tendency due to large
scale precipitation, and total moisture tendency due to diabatic processes.
