<p>Because the land surface is the locus of most human activities, realistic
simulation of continental weather and climate is of crucial importance.
Land-surface parameterizations in today's atmospheric models exhibit a
wide range of complexity: classic "bucket" models (e.g., <a href="#Manabe 1969">Manabe
1969</a>) and detailed soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer schemes (SVATs)
(e.g., <a href="#Dickinson et al. 1993">Dickinson et al. 1993</a>, <a href="#Sellers et al. 1996">Sellers
et al. 1996</a>) occupy opposite ends of the spectrum, while most such
schemes are SVATs that exemplify an intermediate degree of complexity (e.g.,
<a href="#Henderson-Sellers 1996">Henderson-Sellers
1996</a>).
<p>The perceived need to systematically analyze these diverse schemes motivated
the World Climate Research Programme to launch the Project for the Intercomparison
of Land-surface Parameterization Schemes (<a href="http://www.cic.mq.edu.au/pilps-rice/">PILPS</a>)
in 1992. PILPS diagnoses the behaviors of participating land-surface schemes
(hereafter, "PILPS schemes") in controlled experiments implemented in 4
phases. The first two phases include studies of scheme behavior when driven
in "off-line" (one-way feedback) mode by atmospheric forcings prescribed
from GCM output (Phase 1) or from varied observational data sets (Phase
2). PILPS Phase 3 entails the diagnosis of land-surface schemes coupled
to their "home" atmospheric host models, while Phase 4 concerns the analysis
of results from coupling different land-surface schemes to a common host
(<a href="#Henderson-Sellers et al. 1996">Henderson-Sellers et al. 1996</a>).
<p>In practice, Phase 3 has involved the analysis of land-surface schemes
in the <a href="../index-2.html">AMIP</a> models, organized
as Diagnostic Subproject No. 12 (DSP12). This joint AMIP/PILPS proposal
elaborates the rationale for continuing this subproject in AMIP II. Supporting
details are provided on our Web home page <a href="http://www.cic.mq.edu.au/pilps-rice/">http://www.cic.mq.edu.au/pilps-rice/</a>.
<p>In AMIP I, we diagnosed the continental climatologies of some 10 models
with PILPS schemes (for a review of this work, see <a href="#Henderson-Sellers 1999">Henderson-Sellers
1999</a>).&nbsp; Analysis of large-scale climatic differences revealed
the presence of outlier variables in all the simulations (<a href="#Love and Henderson-Sellers 1994">Love
and Henderson-Sellers 1994</a>, <a href="#Love et al. 1995">Love et al.
1995</a>). Diagnosis of regional-scale surface moisture partitioning indicated
that the inter-model scatter in midlatitudes was comparable to that of
the analogous PILPS off-line experiment, despite of the presence of two-way
feedbacks in the AMIP runs (<a href="#Irannejad et al. 1995">Irannejad
et al. 1995)</a>. Subsequent diagnosis of two cases of repeated AMIP I
experiments made with simple bucket vs SVAT schemes in the same atmospheric
model (<a href="#Qu and Henderson-Sellers 1996">Qu and Henderson-Sellers
1996</a>, <a href="#Phillips 1997">Phillips 1997)</a> revealed widespread
statistically significant differences in continental temperature, pressure,
and turbulent fluxes--results in accord with those of analogous studies
(e.g., <a href="#Sato et al. 1989">Sato et al. 1989</a>, <a href="#Thompson and Pollard 1995">Thompson
and Pollard 1995</a>, <a href="#Yang et al. 1995">Yang et al. 1995</a>).
Thus, all our AMIP I analyses highlight the substantial differences in
simulated continental climate that result from coupling diverse land-surface
parameterizations to atmospheric models.
<p>We should note, however, that the makeup of many AMIP I models imposed
certain constraints on our analysis. First, the spectrum of land-surface
scheme complexity was not well represented, in that most models employed
bucket schemes rather than SVATs. Also, a number of AMIP I simulations
were compromised by nonconservation of energy and moisture and/or pronounced
trends in soil moisture and snow mass ( <a href="#Love and Henderson-Sellers 1994">Love
and Henderson-Sellers 1994</a> , <a href="#Robock et al. 1998">Robock et
al. 1998</a>).
<p>The AMIP II models are likely to show significant improvements in both
these respects, in that a richer variety of land-surface schemes that have
been tested in PILPS off-line experiments will be represented, and greater
attention will be paid to model spin-up and related experimental procedures.
Thus, a more meaningful investigation of the nature and import of differences
in the simulation of continental climate should be possible.
<p>Our AMIP I analysis also was limited by the dearth of suitable validation
data. Now, with the availability of several reanalyses that span the AMIP
II years and supplementary land-surface data that cover at least part of
this period, validation is a more feasible, though still problematical,
undertaking. The problems are not only limited to data issues. For example,
<a href="#Gates et al. 1996">Gates
et al. (1996)</a> note the current absence of a definitive formalism for
the validation of coupled (in the AMIP context, land + atmosphere) climate
models. They recommend, however, that model validation proceed along three
paths:
<p>(i) evaluation of the results of coupled model simulations
<p>(ii) tests of individual components of coupled models
<p>(iii) sensitivity studies of component coupling
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Validation path (i) implies that a necessary, but not sufficient, condition
for confidence in coupled model results is "adequate simulation" of the
current climate--a concept that has not been well defined or implemented
to date. The participation of PILPS in AMIP II presents a unique opportunity
to formulate a definition of "adequate simulation" of land-surface climate,
and to evaluate the performance of current-generation GCMs accordingly.
In such an evaluation, the relationship between model performance and land-surface
scheme complexity will be of particular interest. This is our first objective.
<p>Path (ii) of the validation of land-surface scheme prediction entails
testing whether essential processes are captured. From PILPS Phase 2 off-line
studies, we have found that many schemes are able to simulate such processes
to varying degrees, but that in general the performance of any individual
scheme is inferior to that of the ensemble mean when a range of time and
space scales are considered (e.g., <a href="#Shao and Henderson-Sellers 1996">Shao
and Henderson-Sellers 1996)</a>. In addition, while <a href="#Koster and Milley, 1997">Koster
and Milly (1997)</a> demonstrate that essential hydrological processes
in almost all land-surface schemes can be simply represented at monthly
time scales, <a href="#Qu et al. 1998">Qu et al. (1998) </a>show that the
detailed behaviors and degree of sensitivity of these processes to increased
surface air temperature are very different. Moreover, from preliminary
experience pursuing validation path (iii) in the coupled experiments of
PILPS Phase 4 (e.g. <a href="#Peylin et al. 1997">Peylin et al. 1997</a>,
<a href="#Schulz et al. 1997">Schulz
et al. 1997</a>), we have found that differences in the simulation of continental
climate tend to play out most strongly in particular regions. These results
highlight the need to evaluate land-surface scheme behavior in select locations
where processes critical to prediction capability can be carefully studied.
When this is attempted in the context of AMIP II, the analysis methodology
must take account of substantial inter-model differences in surface forcings.
This is our second objective.
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the different phases of PILPS are organized
to yield results along all three of these validation paths. Our subproject
addresses path (i) and identifies regions in which path (iii) should be
pursued; Phases 1 and 2 mainly follow path (ii), while Phase 4 emphasizes
path (iii) and, to a lesser extent, path (i). As much as possible, therefore,
we will draw insights from, and connections to, other PILPS initiatives
in order to deepen our insights on the workings of land-surface schemes
in the AMIP II models. This is our third objective.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="Objectives"></a><b><font size=+1>Objectives</font></b>
<p>To summarize, our objectives in AMIP II are:
<p>1) Validate the simulated continental climates, and assess the relationship
of model performance to land-surface scheme complexity.
<p>2) Identify key regions where continental processes are most sensitive
to the choice of land-surface scheme, and analyze inter-model differences
there.
<p>3) Draw insights from, and connections to, other phases of PILPS.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="Methodology"></a><b><font size=+1>Methodology</font></b>
<p>Here we describe a methodology designed to meet our objectives concerning
the validation and analysis of differences in AMIP II simulations of land-surface
variables. We also briefly describe the relationship of our subproject
to the activities of other phases of PILPS.
<p><a name="Validation"></a><b>a.&nbsp; Validation</b>
<p>We propose to validate the large-scale continental climate of each AMIP
II model, recognizing the problematical nature of such an undertaking:
in spite of recent advances in deriving global observational datasets,
many land-surface variables are not directly observable. Such model validation,
although inherently provisional, will serve as an initial assessment of
the performance of today's GCMs in simulating continental climate. We anticipate
that recommended additions to the <a href="../OUTPUT/WGNEDIAGS/wgnediags.html">WGNE
list of standard model diagnostics</a> for land-surface variables also
will result from this effort.
<p>In the context of AMIP II, validation of a model's continental climate
reflects not only on the performance of the land-surface scheme, but on
that of the coupled system as a whole. We will place highest priority on
validating variables that reflect the response of the land surface more
than the atmospheric forcings (while acknowledging that forcing and response
are not cleanly separable in coupled mode). These "response variables"
include the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, the ground temperature,
and hydrological variables that include the evaporation + sublimation,
runoff + drainage, and moisture stores in soil and snowpack. In order to
interpret the land-surface response, we also will need to validate selected
"forcing variables" such as the net downwelling radiative fluxes, liquid/solid
precipitation, near-surface gradients of temperature and humidity, and
surface wind stresses. At lowest priority, validation of precipitable water,
cloud cover, and surface pressure may clarify the nature of inter-model
differences in forcing or response variables. (Our ultimate choice of validation
variables will attempt to avoid duplicating the efforts of other diagnostic
subprojects as well.)
<p>As initial reference data, we will use the <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/">ECMWF</a>,
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/reanalysis/reanalysis.shtml">NCEP/NCAR</a>,
and
NASA
reanalyses, since these include estimates of the land-surface variables
of interest and span the entire AMIP II period (1979-1995). Moreover, differences
among the reanalyses will serve as estimates of the observational uncertainties
in each validation variable. However, because the reanalyses reflect the
biases of the respective analysis models (e.g., <a href="#Betts et al. 1997">Betts
et al. 1997</a>), wherever possible we also will use other global validation
references that are based primarily on gauge or satellite observing systems
for applicable portions of the AMIP period. Some examples include:

period</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bafg.de/grdc.htm">GRDC</a> river runoff data: available
for varied time periods</li>
</ul>
We will assess the similarity of each model's mean continental climatology
to that of the reference data at spatial scales from continental to global
and at time scales from monthly to annual. We also will validate the interannual
variances of the continental simulations against that of the reanalyses
over the AMIP period, and we also intend to explore certain aspects of
the models' continental predictability performance inasmuch as these may
relate to details of the associated land-surface schemes (e.g. <a href="#Phillips 2001">Phillips
2001</a>)
<p>As objective summaries of the goodness-of-fit of each model climatology
to the reference dataset, we will compute standard statistics such as pattern
correlations, RMS differences, and variance ratios, but also multivariate
measures of the overall spatio-temporal fidelity of each simulation (e.g.
<a href="#Wigley and Santer 1990">Wigley
and Santer 1990,</a> <a href="#Taylor 2001">Taylor 2001</a>). We will supplement
these numerical summaries with selective use of zonal mean plots and maps
of seasonal and/or annual climatologies.
<p>As an outcome of our validation effort, we will note systematic model
biases in the simulation of particular land-surface variables. We also
will examine the relationship (or lack thereof) between overall model performance
and land-surface scheme complexity, as defined by various metrics (e.g.,
<a href="#Henderson-Sellers et al. 1995">Henderson-Sellers
et al. 1995</a>). In this regard, the collective performance of AMIP II
models with bucket schemes will be especially instructive: although buckets
were outliers in the PILPS off-line experiments, in coupled mode the presence
of compensating feedbacks may drive their associated climatologies within
the envelope of observational uncertainties. We also will assess whether
models using modified bucket schemes (e.g., inclusion of spatially varying
field capacity, stomatal resistance, etc.) outperform those retaining the
classical formulation of <a href="#Manabe 1969">Manabe (1969)</a>.
<p><a name="Methodology_Differences"></a><b>b.&nbsp; Analysis of Differences</b>
<p>At the large-scale, diagnosis of inter-model differences will come as
a byproduct of model validation. In addition, we will examine land-surface
processes in several key regions, so as to elucidate detailed differences
in scheme behaviors. This regional analysis of differences will entail
more qualitative interpretation, and less statistical computation, than
our validation effort. We will focus initially on those AMIP II models
with PILPS schemes to formulate initial hypotheses on possible reasons
for regional differences, reserving the remainder of the models/land-surface
schemes for hypothesis testing.
<p>The primary criterion for selection of a key region is that the local
response variables must exhibit significant inter-model differences as
measured, for example, by a battery of multivariate statistical tests.
Secondary considerations will include whether the region shows sensitivity
to changes in land-surface scheme when coupled to the same atmospheric
host (see <a href="#Methodology_Relationship">Relationship to Other Phases
of PILPS</a>), and whether the region overlaps a <a href="http://www.gewex.com/projects.html#hydro">GEWEX
Continental Experimental Projects</a> (e.g.&nbsp; BALTEX, GAME, GCIP, LBA,
MAGS) that can provide a reality check on the simulations. From our AMIP
I analysis and initial experience in coupling different SVATs to the same
atmospheric host (e.g. <a href="#Peylin et al. 1997">Peylin et al. 1997</a>,
<a href="#Schulz et al. 1997">Schulz
et al. 1997</a> ), candidate regions include Amazonia, Saharan Africa,
Tibetan Plateau, Siberia/Northeast Asia, Northern Canada, and Central/Western
USA. After examining the AMIP II data, we will make a final selection of
several regions that are diverse in both climate and biome.
<p>Of all the regional processes of potential interest, we will pay particular
attention to surface evaporation, since this variable link the moisture
and energy budgets. However, because of inter-model forcing differences
that complicate single-variable comparisons, we will concentrate on differences
in the <i>relationships</i> between surface evaporation and other variables.
We may track these connections, for example, by plotting the average month-to-month
regional variation in surface evaporation (latent heat flux) against those
of other moisture (energy) variables for each model. Here, our objective
will not be to "explain" the inter-model differences (probably an unattainable
goal for such coupled nonlinear systems), but only to trace the associated
chain of processes/feedbacks these differences reflect. An example: The
relatively high sensible heat flux in model A is consistent with reduced
snow melt -> reduced soil moisture -> reduced evaporation -> reduced latent
heat flux.
<p>We also may diagnose differences in the temporal variability of surface
evaporation that are likely to depend on the land-surface scheme (<a href="#Koster and Suarez 1994">Koster
and Suarez 1994, </a><a href="#Koster and Suarez 1995">1995</a>). For example,
lagged autocorrelations of monthly evaporation can quantify differences
in climatic persistence (<a href="#Scott et al. 1995">Scott et al. 1995)</a>.
Contingent on the availability of <a href="#High-Frequency Data">optional
high-frequency data</a>, we may investigate differences in the variability
of surface evaporation at daily time scales as well. These diagnostics
can corroborate whether the variability of surface evaporation for bucket
schemes in coupled mode is generally skewed toward lower frequencies than
that for SVATs (<a href="#Scott et al. 1997">Scott et al. 1997</a>), and
whether there are substantial differences in variance structure among the
SVATs.
<p>In addition, we will investigate inter-model differences in regional
partitioning of moisture and energy (e.g., runoff and Bowen ratios) and/or
in the local moisture convergence (P - E). These basic "signatures" of
a land-surface scheme (<a href="#Chen et al. 1997">Chen et al. 1997</a>,
<a href="#Koster and Milley, 1997">Koster
and Milley 1997</a>, <a href="#Koster and Suarez 1994">Koster and Suarez
1994</a>, <a href="#Laval et al. 1996">Laval et al. 1996</a>) are likely
to be less sensitive to inter-model forcing differences than are single
variables.
<p>Where it is necessary to compare single response variables across the
models, we will explore the utility of dividing by the appropriate forcing
variable (e.g., net downwelling shortwave radiation or precipitation),
as a zeroth-order scaling technique. This dimensionless-variable approach
has shown promise in analyzing repeated AMIP I runs with different LSSs
coupled to the same atmospheric model with (<a href="#Phillips 1997">Phillips
1997</a>) and in climate-change experiments with multiple models/LSSs (<a href="#Gedney et al. 2000">Gedney
et al. 2000</a>).
<p><a name="Methodology_Relationship"></a><b>c. Relationship to Other Phases
of PILPS</b>
<p>In our analysis, we will strive to draw insights from other phases of
PILPS. For example, the results of the PILPS Phase 1 and 2 off-line experiments
will provide general guidance for interpreting the regional behavior of
the same schemes in coupled mode. These insights are likely to be most
pertinent where our selected regions overlap the geographical locations
of the off-line experiments (e.g. <a href="#Pitman et al. 1993">Pitman
et al. 1993</a>, <a href="#Henderson-Sellers 1996">Henderson-Sellers 1996</a>,
<a href="#Chen et al. 1997">Chen
et al. 1997</a>, <a href="#Schlosser et al. 1997">Schlosser et al. 1997</a>,
<a href="#Wood et al. 1997">Wood
et al. 1997</a>).
<p>In addition, complementary PILPS Phase 4 studies of different land-surface
schemes coupled to the same atmospheric host model will be especially relevant.
Thus, by coordinating our diagnosis with that of Phase 4, we expect to
deepen our insights on coupled land-atmosphere interactions.
