<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Clouds are clearly an
important component of climate and climate change. Furthermore, although
radiative measurements such as cloud radiative forcing provide excellent
measures of the vertically integrated effect of clouds, models must first
calculate the full three-dimensional structure of clouds in order to calculate
vertically integrated quantities. Thus, there is no substitute for simulating
and understanding cloud amounts and their properties. Weare et al. (1995,
1996) made preliminary comparisons of AMIP I model cloudiness of monthly
mean total, high and low cloud cover with ISCCP C2 and surface observations
of clouds. Although these studies gave useful qualitative results, direct
quantitative conclusions were generally not possible because of uncertainties
in the observations, and differences between the nature of cloud products
available from AMIP I and those of the observations.</div>
<a name="Objectives"></a><b>Objectives</b>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The aim of this diagnostic
subproject is to make as direct as possible quantitative comparisons of
seasonal and ENSO variations ofAMIP II cloud output and the best available
observations. This will be done with a full recognition of the uncertainties
in the observations and the considerable differences in the nature of the
available observations and the model output.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">One of the best available
monthly global cloud data sets is the new ISCCP D2 product, which includes
total cloud fraction and optical depth, as well as cloud amounts, liquid
and ice concentrations, temperature and pressure for nine cloud height
and optical thickness categories. These data are based upon threshold estimates
of cloud combined with radiative transfer inferences of cloud properties.
An important aspect of these data is that they represent cloud properties
as seen from space rather than the layer quantities available from models.
Other possibly useful cloud data are global summaries of surface-based
observations, and a summary of three-layer cloud amounts based upon a combination
of satellite and surface data (Weare, 1999).

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The available AMIP II cloud
products include total cloud amounts and cloud water, and liquid and ice
water contents and cloud amounts at standard pressure or model levels.
The AMIP II total cloud cover and water content are in principle directly
comparable to the ISCCP observations. However, it is not possible to directly
compare the AMIP II and D2 cloud properties as a function of height. Either
the D2 estimates as seen from above must be transformed to model layer
values, or the model layer cloud parameters must be transformed to simulate
the satellite view. The latter transformation requires knowledge of how
cloud layer information is utilized in the model radiative transfer calculations
to derived top-of-atmospheric fluxes. However, the required model 'overlap
assumption' is not readily attainable from standard model output, may be
a strong function of model resolution, and may not be agreement with that
of the real atmosphere.
<p><a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Total cloud amounts and
water content of the AMIP II models will be compared with ISCCP D2 and
C2 estimates following the methodology of Weare et al. (1995). This should
provide a baseline for evaluating changes in the overall state of the simulation
of clouds in models and changes between AMIP I and II. Emphasis will be
on simple statistics characterizing the agreement between models and observations
for the seasonal cycle and the major ENSO events.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In order to compare model
cloudiness as a function of height with observations, new methodologies
will be derived and tested to overcome as much as possible the incompatibilities
between the model and observed clouds. One approach is to define a simple
overlap parameter, which approximately characterizes the overlap assumption
made in the model radiative transfer calculations. Assuming that the reported
total cloud amount is that utilized in the radiation calculations, then
it is possible to defined an overlap parameter a<sub>over</sub>, such that

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">where the<sub> </sub>f<sub>I</sub>'sare
the layer cloud amounts in a model or observations. When a<sub>over</sub>
equals one, the overlap is the classical random overlap assumption. When
a<sub>over</sub> is less than one, there is less clear sky and clouds are
horizontally more dispersed than using the random assumption. a<sub>over</sub>
greater than one corresponds to clouds, which are more stacked than in
the random case. Figs. 1 and 2 show the annual mean a<sub>over</sub> for
the ERA and NCEP reanalysis clouds. Clearly, these two estimates differ
considerably from each other, implying that the two reanalyses have very
different vertical cloud structures even though their total cloud amounts
are similar. Thus an important comparison in AMIP II might be the a<sub>over</sub>'s
themselves.

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;
<br>Once a transformation between model layer clouds and satellite or surface
observations has been defined, then direct comparison of cloud amounts
and water content are possible. In order to minimize the effects of uncertainties
associated with the threshold decisions required in the D2 observational
analysis, one can carry out the above analyses with emissivity or albedo
weighted cloud amounts using estimated or calculated cloud water amounts.
An advantage of such weighting is that it would largely remove the differences
in high cloud cover due to the effects of undetected thin clouds. In addition
to comparisons employing the standard AMIP II cloud output, we will with
the cooperation of a few modeling groups use instantaneous model output
to characterize model overlap and simulate satellite and surface observations.</div>
