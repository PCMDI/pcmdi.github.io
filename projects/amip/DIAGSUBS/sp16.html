<p>The potential climatic importance of the stratosphere has been recognised
by the WMO by the initiation of the SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and
their Role in Climate) programme (WMO 1993).&nbsp; The aims of SPARC are
to develop a more complete understanding of stratospheric processes, with
particular emphasis on their importance for the circulation and energy
balance of the troposphere. One SPARC initiative,GRIPS (GCM-Reality Intercomparison
for SPARC), will assess our capability of modelling the atmosphere from
the surface to the stratopause using troposphere-stratosphere-mesosphere
GCMs. GRIPS is co-ordinated by Dr. Pawson (FU Berlin, Germany) and Dr.
Kodera (MRI, Tsukuba, Japan). In the EU-funded EuroGRIPS programme, four
European members of the GRIPS community (FU Berlin, UKMO, CGAM and CNRM)
have established a formal link to investigate several aspects of this problem.

<p>GRIPS is split into two (or more) phases. In the first phase a set of
intercomparisons will be undertaken. The results obtained and links established
between the GRIPS participants during the first phase will allow the identification
of a realistic set of numerical experiments (such as those in AMIP) which
can be performed during the second phase of the project. The aims of AMIP
are: (i) identification of systematic errors in atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs);
(ii) improvements in model formulations. The first phase of GRIPS is well-advanced
and, given the overlap between AMIP and GRIPS, it is natural to carry out
numerical experiments which address the aims of both AMIP and GRIPS.

<p>In this diagnostic subproject, we focus on the climatology of the stratosphere.&nbsp;
Studies of the variability in the stratosphere (e.g. sudden warmings) will
be carried out as well.

<p>The question to be addressed by this subproject is: What elements are
needed in AGCMs to provide an accurate representation of the stratosphere?
The work in this subproject will build toward addressing the following
questions: (1) How important is an accurate representation of the stratosphere
in climate models? (2) What is the impact of changes in stratospheric composition
on the climate?

<p>Current climate models vary widely in the resolution and sophistication
with which they represent the stratosphere. The impact of a realistically
represented stratosphere (whether it be a higher upper boundary in climate
models and/or higher resolution in the stratosphere) on medium range forecasts
and climate simulations needs to be investigated, particularly in those
models used for climate change. Boville (1984) showed how such influences
can lead to significant changes in the modelled climate. Kodera (1993)
showed how perturbations to the polar night jet can propagate downwards
from the upper stratosphere to the troposphere throughout a winter.&nbsp;
Further studies have isolated connections between the non-zonal circulation
in the middle atmosphere with that in the troposphere. Recent statistical
work (Baldwin et al. 1994, Perlwitz and Graf 1995) has provided evidence
for a connection between the North Atlantic Oscillation in the troposphere
and the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex; however, these statistical
studies do not show the causal link between the stratosphere and the troposphere.

<p>There are at least three possible advantages of including the stratosphere
in climate models. First, by removing the upper boundary in the models
away from the lower and middle stratosphere, possible adverse effects should
be reduced. Secondly, resolving the middle atmosphere allows an improved
representation of stratospheric processes; this is important for possible
studies of the impact of stratospheric changes on tropospheric climate.
Since stratospheric observations may provide early signals of climate change,
an accurate representation of the stratosphere in climate models would
be fundamental in understanding these signals. Thirdly, having an adequate
representation of the stratospheric circulation in climate models allows
a more physically-based treatment of important trace gases such as H2O,
CH4 and N2O.

<p>Future climate change will be influenced by trends in the concentration
of stratospheric ozone and other radiatively active trace gases. Understanding
the response of GCMs to modifications in the atmospheric composition is
crucial to our ability to predict climate change due to anthropogenically
induced variations in trace gas concentrations and aerosols. The importance
of stratospheric processes is highlighted by the study of Santer et al.
(1996), who found that the effects of CO2 and sulphate aerosols alone cannot
explain the observed spatial distribution of the temperature trends; inclusion
of a reduction of stratospheric ozone led to a better agreement between
the modelled and observed temperature trends.

<p>Before we can address the question of whether, in AGCMs, the stratosphere
has an impact on the tropospheric climate, we must ascertain that these
models have a realistic representation of&nbsp; the stratosphere. This
subproject addresses this last issue.

<p><a name="objectives"></a><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>Objectives</font></font></b>

<p>Assess the simulation of the stratospheric circulation by AGCMs with
a troposphere-stratosphere configuration.

<p><a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>

<p>The AGCMs developed at institutions participating in both AMIP-II and
GRIPS and which have model levels extending to pressures less than 1 hPa
(UKMO, NCAR, CNRM and perhaps others) will form the basis of the studies
in this subproject. The models at UKMO (Cullen 1993) and NCAR (Boville
1995) have been developed for use in climate and middle atmosphere studies.
These models provide an ideal test-bed for controlled simulations of the
stratospheric circulation. (Note that both the UKMO and NCAR models will
have AMIP runs with two different configurations: one focusing on the troposphere
and a second configuration with additional levels extending through the
stratosphere. These will be available for assessing the impact on the simulated
tropospheric climate of using a higher upper boundary and improving the
vertical resolution.)

<p>The AMIP runs of the stratospheric configurations of the models will
be compared with climatologies of the stratosphere produced from UKMO analyses,
NCEP analyses and from the ERA dataset to evaluate the AGCMs' performance
in reproducing the mean climate and variability of the stratosphere. The
data requirements from Tables 1 and 6, and the extra stratospheric data
requested, indicate the geophysical parameters which will be used in this
subproject.

<p>The stratospheric circulation in the models will be assessed in the
following manner:
<ul>(1) Model climatologies of the monthly-mean data will be calculated
from the monthly mean fields. Zonal mean cross-sections of winds and temperatures
will be compared. In addition, maps of monthly mean geopotential heights,
winds and temperatures will be compared at selected pressure levels (e.g.
100 hPa, 50 hPa, 10 hPa and 1 hPa).

<p>(2) Interannual variations of the monthly-mean data will be calculated
from the model integrations, and compared with the equivalent fields from
analysed data. The nature of the interannual variations will be compared,
as well as whether the variations in the simulated data are correlated
with the equivalent observed variations.

<p>(3) The simulated planetary-wave structure (amplitudes and phases) will
be assessed from the monthly-mean fields.

<p>(4) Time series of monthly-mean fields will be constructed, in order
to assess the simulation of variations on seasonal and longer time-scales.
For example, a time series of the variations of winds over the equator
will be used to compare the model simulations of the Semi-Annual and Quasi-Biennial
Oscillations.

<p>(5) Time series will be constructed from the high frequency model data
to compare the model simulations of higher frequency phenomena. For example,
a time series of 50 hPa temperature at the poles will be used to compare
the model simulations of stratospheric warmings.

<p>(6) The model simulations of low temperatures at 50 hPa will be compared,
since these are important for the simulation of ozone depletion, because
of the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) at low temperatures.
Time series will be produced of the minimum temperatures at middle to high
latitudes. Time series will also be produced of the areas below particular
threshold temperatures relevant to PSC formation.

<p>(7) The high frequency fields will also be used to assess the model
simulations of such phenomena as stratospheric sudden warmings and vortex
mergers, by plotting synoptic maps for periods of particular dynamical
interest.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Within the GRIPS project, participants will be doing a fuller comparison
of stratospheric fields. Examples include time series of the north pole
and south pole temperatures at 10 hPa, latitude-pressure time series of
the averaged zonal wind at 60oN and 60oS, and synoptic maps of 10 hPa geopotential
height for interesting periods such as sudden warmings in the northern
hemisphere and vortex mergers in the southern hemisphere.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This subproject will build on the parallel research being undertaken
through the SPARC sponsored GRIPS project, including the EU-funded EuroGRIPS
project.
