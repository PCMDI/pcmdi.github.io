<br><a name="background"></a><b>Background</b>
<p>The general large-scale features and their seasonal evolution are reasonably
well known. They are characterized during the rainy season in northern
summer by an inflow of moisture from the ocean (Cadet and Nnoli, 1987).
At higher levels, 600/700 hPa, a strong easterly jet is present. The AEJ
has been shown to be barotropically and baroclinically unstable and supports
the growth of African easterly waves with characteristic frequencies of
3 to 5 days (Reed et al., 1977; Thorncroft and Hoskins, 1994a; Thorncroft
and Hoskins, 1994b; Thorncroft, 1995). Waves with characteristic frequencies
between 6 to 9 days have been also observed (de Felice et al., 1990). The
evolution of convection during the West African monsoon is much less known.
Large convective systems were found to travel from east to west but it
is not yet clear how they are linked to the instabilities of the easterly
jet (Duvel, 1990). The link between these large scale systems and the more
mesoscale squall line has still to be established (Barnes and Sieckman,
1984). These large convective systems are an important component of the
West African monsoon as they bring about 70 percents of the total annual
rainfall. The West African region is one of the regions of the world most
exposed to the interannual variability of climate. It has experienced a
severe drought over the last 30 years. Two main explanations have been
put forward to explain this sensitivity. First Charney (1977) suggested
that land surface changes might have affected the evolution of the monsoon.
The second explanation attributes these rainfall anomalies to variations
of the sea surface temperatures (Rowell et al., 1995).
<p>New studies have shown that the interannual variability of rainfall
in the West African region is characterized by a strong reduction in the
frequency of intense convective systems while the number of small and medium
systems remains largely unchanged (Le Barb? and Lebel, 1997). Interestingly
this sensitivity is reproduced by AGCMs in experiments where land-surface
conditions have changed (Polcher, 1995). These new results and the already
well known features of the climate of West Africa will be used to evaluate
the ability of current AGCMs to model the monsoon and its interannual variability.
Special attention will be paid to the characteristics of the variability
of convection with the aim of verifying the processes modeled by AGCMs.
This analysis subproject will be part of the work proposed to the European
Commission in the project West African Monsoon Project (WAMP) coordinated
by Chris Thorncroft.
<p><a name="Objectives"></a><b>Objectives</b>
<p>The aim of this subproject is to evaluate the ability of the atmospheric
general circulation models participating in AMIP to simulate various aspects
of the African monsoon. This will include an examination of intraseasonal,
seasonal and interannual variability. Special focus will be given to precipitation,
easterly waves, the African easterly jet (AEJ) and convective systems.
A number of mechanisms have been proposed to describe the evolution of
the African monsoon but very few consider the interactions between the
dynamics and convection. The interannual fluctuations of rainfall in this
region have been in turn attributed to land-surface processes and variations
in the sea surface temperatures. With this comparison of AGCMs, an attempt
will be made to answer the following questions :
<ul>
<li>
How well do models simulate the West African monsoon climatology ?</li>

<li>
Which African waves are represented by the models ?</li>

<li>
Do the dominant frequencies found in rainfall vary from one model to the
other ?</li>

<li>
Are convection and dynamical waves linked in similar ways in all models
?</li>

<li>
Is the interannual variability of these processes represented by all models
?</li>
</ul>
<a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<p>An effort will be made to develop indices or other simple diagnostics
which can easily be applied to all models. Then the analysis will be refined
on those models which are representative of the largest number or show
special features.
<blockquote><b>3.1 Climatological field</b>s
<br>The climatological fields of rainfall and dynamical/thermodynamical
variables will be examined over West Africa, especially in July-September,
and compared with observational data and re-analyses. Rainfall indices
will be computed for different areas (Western and Eastern Sahel, Soudan,
Guinea Coast) as well as their seasonal cycle. These indexes will be used
to define rainfall patterns over West Africa for each summer (Janicot,
1992). A West African Monsoon Index WAMI, as difference between wind at
200 hPa and at 925 hPa (Fontaine et al., 1995) will be used to characterize
monsoon dynamics in the different GCM. This index will be correlated with
SST and West African rainfall patterns. Several horizontal and vertical
cross-section mean fields in July-September will be inter-compared, describing
the main features of the wind fields and humidity fields (monsoon ux, AEJ,
TEJ, moist static energy). Potential vorticity will be computed for the
analysis of barotropic and baroclinic instability conditions linked to
the development of easterly waves.
<p><b>3.2 African easterly wave</b>s
<br>The easterly wave activity in the AGCMs will be investigated and compared.
This will include a study of the nature of the waves including their period,
wavelength and track, as well as their relationship with rainfall. It is
likely for example that the relationship with model rainfall will vary
from model to model depending on the convection scheme used. The relevance
of such differences to simulations of the WAM will be investigated. One
important focus of this work will be to identify the relationship between
interannual variability of the WAM rainfall and easterly wave activity.
The African easterly jet will also be an important focus in this study.
<p><b>3.3 Frequency of convective systems</b>
<br>As it was done with in-situ observations (Le Barb? and Lebel, 1997)
convective systems will be described and binned according to the precipitation
they produce. The frequency distribution can then be compared to the observational
record in order to validate the mean climate and it's interannual variations.
This measure
<br>&nbsp;will also be used to compare the models. It is expected that
the frequency distribution will be related to the convection scheme used
in the AGCM but it will also depend on the quality of the simulated African
monsoon.
<p><b>3.4 Synthesis : the interannual variability</b>
<br>All these diagnostics will then be compared to determine if models
behave similarly in each of them. These intercomparisons will indicate
if relations exist between these diagnostics or if on the contrary models
failing one might do well in another. At this point the interannual variability
simulated by the models for the three topics described above will be compared
in relation to SST anomalies. This will yield information on the relation
which might exist between these three aspects of the African monsoon. For
instance is the interannual variability in the frequency of convection
related to that of the easterly waves or is it correlated in similar ways
to the SST anomalies as a mean precipitation index ?</blockquote>
