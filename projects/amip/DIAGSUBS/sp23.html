<p>Major modes of climate variability such as the Southern Oscillation,
the North Atlantic Oscillation and the North Pacific Oscillation may be
viewed as perturbations in the mean locations and intensities of a few
atmospheric centers of action (COA).&nbsp; It follows that our understanding
of interannual variability can be improved by diagnosing the simulated
COAs in terms of model physical parameterizations.&nbsp; This proposed
subproject is a continuation of AMIP I subproject 23 with the aim to investigate
important aspects of the morphology, the genesis and the variability of
the COAs in the Pacific,&nbsp; Atlantic and Indian oceans in AMIP II model
simulations, to compare the model simulated COAs with observations and
reanalysis data, and to attempt to relate inter-model differences in the
COA features in terms of the differences in model physical parameterizations.

<p>A comprehensive study of the atmospheric centers of action was carried
out by Gilbert Walker based on the calculation of correlation coefficients
between pressure, temperature and precipitation, and reported in a series
of papers with the title ?World Weather? published between 1924 and 1937.&nbsp;
Rossby (1939) discussed fluctuation of pressure in a COA in terms of changes
in the intensity of zonal circulation.&nbsp; At present we lack satisfactory
dynamical explanations for the genesis and observed structures of the COAs.&nbsp;
Santer (1988) developed objective indices for the locations and intensities
of the COA's and compared their values for the Azores High and the Icelandic
Low in the OSU AGCM, the OSU CGCM and the GISS GCM. Using the procedure
of Santer (1988) we have developed indices for the intensities and latitude
and longitude locations for the Azores High, the Hawaiian High, the Icelandic
Low and the Aleutian Low in observational data and several AMIP I simulations.&nbsp;
The seasonal variations of the four COA's in the MPI simulation were compared
with observations by Hameed et al. (1995).&nbsp; The relationship between
surface pressures in the Azores High and the Hawaiian High and local diabatic
cooling rates was compared between NCEP reanalysis fields and the MPI AMIP
I simulation by Shi and Hameed (1996).&nbsp; The pressure and the locations
of the Icelandic Low in winter and the Azores High in winter and summer
are significantly correlated with pre-season values of the indices of the
four COA's and to SST anomalies in the North Atlantic (Hameed et al., 1996).&nbsp;
Our current work aims to use these for developing prediction schemes for
the indices of the Icelandic Low and the Azores High.&nbsp; Diagnostic
studies on a relationship between the Asian monsoon and the intensity of
the Hawaiian High in summer have been carried out by Shi and Hameed (1997).
<p>Our experience with AMIP I suggests that monthly mean data may be used
for diagnostic studies of the summer subtropical high pressure systems.
However archived daily data is needed to analyze winter circulation that
affects the subtropical highs and the low pressure systems at higher latitudes.&nbsp;
The expanded data base of AMIP II offers unique advantages in such analyses.&nbsp;
Transient momentum and heat fluxes in a number of GCMs, with different
orographic effects, gravity wave drag, land-sea temperature differences
and boundary layer parameterizations can be compared to obtain a better
understanding of the genesis of the four COAs in winter and summer.

<p><a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<p>We expect to carry out this investigation with&nbsp; AMIP II simulations,
comparing&nbsp; models with distinct parameterizations of topography and
diabatic heating rates.&nbsp; Detailed diagnostics of the Centers of Action
in the North and South Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the Indian Ocean
will be carried out in the following tentative sequence:
<ul>i.&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe the seasonal variation in each of the COA parameters,
compare
<br>with observations, interpret in terms of GCM simulated thermal, topographic
<br>and transient forcings, and NCEP reanalysis fields.&nbsp; Temporal
variation
<br>will be characterized by Fourier analysis.
<br>ii.&nbsp; Describe the interannual variations in the COA parameters,
compare
<br>with observations, interpret in terms of GCM simulated thermal, topographic
<br>and transient forcings and NCEP reanalysis fields.
<br>iii. Relate the interannual variations in the COA parameters to the
<br>simulated NAO, the NPO and the SO and their teleconnections.</ul>
<a name="data"></a><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>Data Requirements</font></font></b>
<p>Data available in the AMIP II standard output including monthly averaged
values of SLP, Geopotential Heights, SSTs, Precipitation, Diabatic Heating
Rates, Vertical Velocities, Temperature at standard pressure levels; Daily
averaged wind and air temperature, OLR, 500 mb vertical velocity, Geopotential
Height, Radiation Fluxes, Potential Vorticity.
<p>AGREEMENT TO PROTOCOL
<ul>We agree to cooperate with PCMDI and the AMIP panel, to provide a set
of our principal diagnostic results for archival storage at PCMDI, and
to prepare a report for the WGNE/WCRP series.</ul>
