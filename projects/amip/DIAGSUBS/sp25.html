<p>The general circulation model (GCM) has been used extensively to study
global climate change and its regional distribution due to increasing atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations&nbsp; and sulfate aerosols associated with
human activities.&nbsp; One important issue related to the continued development
and application of GCMs for climate change studies is the ability of the
GCMs to simulate the presently observed regional climate characteristics.&nbsp;
An understanding of the causes of the models' inadequacy in simulating
these characteristics will lead to improvement of these models.

<p>East Asia is located in the southeast part of the Eurasian continent.&nbsp;
It is bordered in the east by the Pacific Ocean and in the southwest by
the Tibetan Plateau which penetrates into the middle troposphere.&nbsp;
These unique geographic features produce distinct climate characteristics
over east Asia.&nbsp; Observational analyses indicate that this region
has the strongest heat sources/sinks in the Northern Hemisphere, and that
the Tibetan Plateau creates vigorous dynamic and thermal forcings; both
factors induce substantial atmospheric responses that result in a well-defined,
seasonally varying general circulation features.&nbsp; In winter, the primary
features are the lower-tropospheric continental high, the upper-tropospheric
east Asian westerly jet, the east Asian trough and the stratospheric Aleutian
high. In summer, the dominant features include the lower-tropospheric continental
heat low and the upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric Tibetan high.

<p>These stationary circulation systems produce several unique regional
climate characteristics over east Asia, including (1) the mid-tropospheric
Zonal Index Cycle (ZIC) which describes the vacillation between "high (zonal)
index" and "low (meridional) index" circulation patterns; (2) the Seasonal
Abrupt Changes (SACs) in June and October caused by non-linear atmospheric
responses to large-scale external forcings, such as seasonal variations
in solar insolation, and the dynamic and thermal effects of the Tibetan
Plateau; and (3) the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) characterized by heavy precipitation
in summer and cold surges in winter.&nbsp; Note that ZIC, SAC and EAM are
not independent features.&nbsp; For instance, the onset of summer and winter
EAM is closely associated with SAC.&nbsp; In addition, rainfall identified
with the prevailing zonal circulation patterns is caused by processes that
differ substantially from those related to extratropical cyclones and tropical
deep convection.&nbsp; The summer EAM rainband is typically a quasi-stationary
large-scale feature that produces continuous precipitation.&nbsp; Embedded
within the rainband are mesoscale vortices, which produce intense local
rainfall.&nbsp; It is well known that these EAC characteristics experience
substantial intraseasonal and interannual variability.&nbsp; Note that
additional details and relevant references were included in the AMIP I
proposal.

<p>To study the capability of GCMs in simulating the climate over this
region, an international research project entitled, "General Circulation
Model Simulations of the East Asian Climate (EAC)" was initiated in the
Fall of 1994 (Subproject No. 25) within Phase-I of the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP).&nbsp; Since its inception, three workshops
have been organized: October 18-20, 1994 at SUNY-Albany, New York; November
16-18, 1995 at the National Central University, Chung-li, Taiwan; and April
28-30, 1997 at the Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, Nanjing, China.

<p>Significant progress have been made, in particular the summer monsoon,
including the atmospheric circulation characteristics during onset, the
role of middle latitude jet streams in affecting rainfall and its movement,
the energy and moisture components in the Bay of Bengal, South China Sea
and the Tibetan-Plateau.&nbsp; The active participating groups in EAC include:

<a name="objectives"></a><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>Objectives</font></font></b>

<p>The project has two main objectives:&nbsp; To assess the ability of
current GCMs to simulate the EAC, including vacillations between high and
low zonal index circulation, abrupt seasonal change in the atmospheric
circulation and the east Asian monsoon.

<p>To study the mechanisms and factors that cause the intraseasonal to
interannual variability in the EAC, which include the dynamic and thermal
effects of the Tibetan Plateau, anomalous surface boundary conditions (e.g.,
temperature, snow cover, soil moisture) over the Eurasian continent.

<p><a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>General Consideration</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>The study will be conducted by examining:&nbsp;
(1) Systematic biases of the climatological mean and interannual variability
of individual climate parameters, which include sea level pressure, surface
temperature, wind, precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation, 500 mb height,
snow/ice cover; (2) Consistency of the biases between the individual parameters;&nbsp;
and (3) the geophysical factors and mechanisms which have dominate influences
over EAC.&nbsp; Statistical analyses of these parameters will be performed
to examine their variations and internal consistency while GCM sensitivity
experiments will be conducted to identify the causes for the model biases
for their further improvements.</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>In addition to the comparisons discussed
above, it will be useful to compare moist potential vorticity (MPV), a
variable which can characterize the evolution of lower tropospheric motions.&nbsp;
MPV consists of a dynamic component (the specific absolute vorticity) and
a thermodynamic component (the 3-D gradient of equivalent potential temperature).&nbsp;
It has been demonstrated that its isobaric presentation is an excellent
indicator of summer monsoon frontal rainfall.</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>Specific Considerations</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>The ZIC and SAC are large-scale
phenomena that can be resolved by the resolution of the participating AMIP
GCMs.&nbsp; It is straightforward to define the ZIC and to identify the
temporal and spatial variations of SAC.&nbsp; Statistical techniques (such
as spectrum analysis, EOF analysis, correlation analysis and EP flux) will
be used to investigate ZIC and SAC variability.</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>It is difficult, however, to define
the EAM in a GCM.&nbsp;&nbsp; We plan to study first the East Asian Summer
Monsoon (EASM) with focus on the onset.&nbsp; For the period of mid-April
through mid-June (pre-onset, onset and post-onset), Hovmoller diagrams
of climatological five-days running means of a variety of parameters (temperature,
precipitation, cloud, moisture and wind) for several critical regions will
be compared.&nbsp; Note that proper spatial scales need to be considered
in averaging the GCM outputs over the specified latitudinal or longitudinal
zones.&nbsp; We plan also to study, in addition to the climatological means,
the characteristics of individual years.</font></font>

<p><a name="data"></a><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+0>Data Requirements</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>The available AMIP II data are listed in the Appendix A of AMIP Newsletter
No. 8 (August 1996).&nbsp; The spatial domain covers (60E-180E; 20S-70N).&nbsp;
Our needs for the monthly mean values are included in Tables 1 and 2 and
will not repeated here.&nbsp; To study some of the key characteristics
such as the monsoon onset, we request the 6-hourly data listed in Table
3 (all) and Table 6 (partial).</ul>
