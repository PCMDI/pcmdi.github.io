<p>Tropospheric humidity and its fluxes figure prominently in both the
global water and energy cycles.&nbsp; For this reason, at least two diagnostic
subprojects of the first AMIP considered aspects of the models' simulations
of water vapor.&nbsp; One of these was Diagnostic Subproject 11, "Validation
of Humidity, Moisture Fluxes, and Soil Moisture in GCMs," which investigated
how well the AMIP models simulated precipitable water over different portions
of the globe on decadal-mean, seasonal, and interannual time scales.&nbsp;
Those results, and a preliminary assessment of the net meridional flux
of water vapor in the AMIP model runs, are reported by Gaffen et al. (1997).

<p>Here we propose extensions to our AMIP analyses, which were necessarily
limited by the contents of the AMIP standard output archive.&nbsp; The
enhanced output for AMIP II, however, will allow us to consider additional
moisture variables, namely, gridded specific and relative humidity and
direct values of the northward flux of water vapor.&nbsp; In addition,
AMIP II may offer an opportunity to pursue sensitivity experiments to relate
success in simulating moisture to model formulation.&nbsp; The general
tests performed by Gaffen et al. (1997) on the ensemble of AMIP models
yielded few clear results in this regard.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is reasonable
to expect that some model attributes (such as horizontal grid resolution
or convective parameterization method) might influence individual AMIP
II model's simulations of moisture-related fields, and we are interested
in pursuing this line of inquiry; such a study would be aided if some AMIP
II modeling groups undertake sensitivity experiments.

<p>Although the principal source of observational data for AMIP II is intended
to be atmospheric reanalyses, the quality of these products is problematic
for water vapor (Trenberth and Guillemot 1996).&nbsp; As was the case in
the first AMIP, therefore, we intend to incorporate water vapor observations
from a variety of sources (including radiosonde-based data sets and specialized
satellite measurements) in our diagnoses of AMIP II models, and we will
emphasize those regions where the data are deemed to be most reliable.

<p><a name="Objectives"></a><font size=+1>Objectives</font>

<p>Our main objectives are the diagnosis of the climatological-mean and
seasonal and interannual variability of tropospheric relative humidity
and meridional moisture flux.&nbsp; Two of our main results for the AMIP
models were that they tend systematically to underestimate precipitable
water and to overestimate decadal-mean meridional vapor flux (which we
computed from the archived standard output of evaporation and precipitation).&nbsp;&nbsp;
For AMIP II we wish to investigate the following questions:

<p>a.&nbsp; Relative Humidity

<p>Using monthly mean surface and upper-air relative humidity output, we
will calculate the climatological mean and measures of the seasonal and
interannual variability of relative humidity from the surface to 100 hPa.
These will be compared with radiosonde-based upper-air humidity observations
(Ross and Elliott 1996) in the lower and mid-troposphere and with upper-tropospheric
relative humidity estimates from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder
(Soden and Bretherton 1996).&nbsp; Given current interest in the ramifications
of upper-tropospheric humidity variations for water vapor-greenhouse effect
feedback, special attention will be devoted to that region of the atmosphere.&nbsp;
Comparison of the clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation with satellite
observations will provide insight into how specific deficiencies in the
moisture distribution influence simulations of greenhouse effect of water
vapor.

<p>Our analysis will likely involve zonal mean values and maps of particular
regions in which radiosonde observations are abundant (for comparisons
with radiosonde data) and global maps (for comparisons with satellite data).&nbsp;
While our focus will be on relative humidity, we will also investigate
precipitable water and may consider temperature and specific humidity fields
to determine how humidity biases are related to biases in the thermal structure
of the model atmospheres.

<p>b.&nbsp; Meridional Moisture Flux

<p>The primary moisture flux quantity we plan to diagnose is Q-flux, the
zonal-mean, vertically-integrated northward transport of water vapor.&nbsp;
This quantity plays a major role in the global energy cycle, its latent
heat accounting for approximately one-half of the total energy carried
poleward by the atmosphere annually across 40 degrees N.&nbsp; Beyond the
climatological mean value of Q-flux, we will compute measures of the seasonal
and interannual variability in Q-flux for each model during the AMIP II
period.&nbsp; Because the calculation of Q-flux from the archived AMIP
II standard output fields may, in some cases, yield inaccurate estimates
of this quantity (e.g., Williamson et al. 1996), we propose also to infer
Q-flux from the archived values of evaporation and precipitation, as in
Gaffen et al. (1997), to provide an independent measure of the net meridional
moisture flux.

<p>Although intermodel comparisons of Q-flux results will be important
in revealing the level of agreement among the models, comparisons with
observations will also be worthwhile even though reliable global analyses
of moisture flux do not currently exist.&nbsp; We expect to consider several
observational data sets to help gauge the uncertainty in them; in particular,
both reanalyses and the radiosonde-only based analyses of Oort will be
used, despite each containing recognized shortcomings in moisture-related
fields.&nbsp; Our main focus will be on Q-flux and its temporal variability,
but we also plan to examine the fields of v and q used to construct Q-flux
to identify the sources of major discrepancies in Q-flux, either among
models or between models and observations.
