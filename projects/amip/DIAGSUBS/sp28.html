<blockquote>Proper simulation of snow cover in climate models is important
for numerous reasons such as snow-cover climate feedbacks (albedo-temperature,
snow-cloud), and correct simulation of soil moisture, runoff and ground
temperatures (Cohen and Rind, 1991; Marshall et al., 1994; Lynch-Stieglitz,
1994). Snow cover is also an excellent diagnostic for evaluation since
both temperature and precipitation must be realistic in order to correctly
model important snow cover properties such as duration, water-equivalent
and density (Foster et al., 1996). Results of an AMIP I snow cover evaluation
(Frei and Robinson, 1995; 1998) and recent GCM snow cover verification
studies (Foster et al., 1996; Walland and Simmonds, 1996) demonstrated
that to a first order, GCMs captured the seasonal cycle of NH snow cover
extent. However, the results also revealed (1) major differences between
model representations of snow cover, (2) seasonal biases in hemispheric
snow covered area, and (3) consistently poor simulation of regional snow
cover over Tibet and China linked to model deficiencies in simulating air
temperature and precipitation.&nbsp; Among the problems that remain outstanding
from AMIP-1, Gates et al. (1999) identify "the portrayal of the interactions
between the land surface and hydrological processes."&nbsp; In this subproject,
Rutgers University, the University of Colorado and the Canadian Atmospheric
Environment Service are proposing to focus their combined expertise in
snow cover remote sensing and data analysis to provide a systematic analysis
of the snow cover performance of the models included in AMIP II.</blockquote>
<a name="objective"></a><b>Objectives</b>
<blockquote>The initial stage of this AMIP subproject will focus on verifying
spatial and temporal aspects of snow cover simulations over the Northern
Hemisphere relying mainly on NOAA weekly satellite snow cover observations
(Robinson et al, 1993).&nbsp; A detailed regional evaluation of snow cover
properties (snow water equivalent (SWE) and density) will be carried out
over the Canadian prairies using snow course observations and SWE estimates
from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) algorithm of Walker and
Goodison (1993). Following this first step, an attempt will be made to
diagnose the most significant model-to-model and model-observed differences
by examining and verifying some of the main driving parameters (e.g. temperature
and precipitation fields) and atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g. the
PNA and NAO which were shown to be linked closely to snow cover variability
over North America (NA) by Gutzler and Rosen (1992) and Brown and Goodison
(1996)). Guidance on which driving parameters to investigate will be provided
from sensitivity analysis of the CROCUS physical snowpack model (Brun et
al., 1989 - updated in 1996). Physical processes will also need to be investigated.&nbsp;
For instance, verification of simulated snow cover in BATS by Yang et al.
(1997) suggested that special attention must be given to downward longwave
radiation, the snow aging process (density and surface albedo) and the
critical temperature for rain/snow separation.</blockquote>
<a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<blockquote>5.1 Snow cover extent climatology comparison
<p>This step will involve the computation of standard monthly statistics
(mean, s.d., extremes) of continental (NA, Eurasia) and hemispheric snow
covered area (SCA) over the 17-year period to determine how well the models
simulate the main features of NH snow cover extent (seasonal cycle, extremes,
interannual variability) as determined from the Rutgers-corrected version
of the NOAA weekly snow cover dataset (Robinson et al., 1993). Monthly
SCA difference (obs-modeled) plots will be used to identify areas with
significant snow cover discrepancies. In these areas, an assessment will
be made of the quality of satellite observations (where snow depth observations
are available), and the simulated air temperature and precipitation fields.
Inter-model differences will be assessed through examination of diagnostic
variables such as ground temperature, surface albedo, surface radiation
and energy fluxes, and runoff. The ECMWF and NCEP reanalysis data sets
and available temperature and precipitation climatologies (e.g. Legates
and Willmott, 1990; Huffman et al., 1997) will be used to examine model-
observed and model-model differences.
<p>5.2 Snow depth climatology comparison
<p>Most models compute snow mass and infer snow water equivalent using
many different assumptions about snow density.&nbsp; Some of the more sophisticated
snow models compute snow density but this information will need to be determined
for each model.&nbsp; If modeled snow density information is available,
this will be verified against available snow course observations (extensive
data are available over Canada and the FSU).&nbsp; One approach to this
problem is to use available snow course observations to define a NH monthly
snow density climatology, which would be applied to all model snow mass
fields.&nbsp; The disadvantage of this approach is that it ignores interannual
variability in snow density, but it does allow all models to be compared
in a consistent fashion.&nbsp; Modeled mean snow depths will be compared
to available NH snow depth climatologies (RAND and USAF).&nbsp; These climatologies
may be biased high compared to the AMIP II period, as the NOAA SCA data
(1972 to date) show that NH snow cover anomalies were consistently negative
during the late 1980s and early 1990s.&nbsp; An attempt will be made to
quantify this (at least over NA) using available snow depth observations.&nbsp;
Systematic differences in snow depths will be assessed by looking at how
well models simulate important processes such as rain/snow separation,
snow aging (density and albedo) and winter melt events.&nbsp; It is proposed
to use the CROCUS snowpack model to help provide insight into possible
sources of systematic error in GCM snow cover simulations. Snow cover albedo
will be assessed through a pentad 1 degree by 1 degree albedo data set
being developed at Rutgers.
<p>Access to the high frequency model snow cover output is necessary for
process studies and for verifying snow cover in shoulder seasons and in
regions with ephemeral snow cover.
<p>5.3 Snow water-equivalent climatology comparison
<p>There are no known reliable hemispheric climatologies of SWE.&nbsp;
However, two project members (DR and AF) in cooperation with colleagues
at the Universities of Delaware and North Dakota, have just received funding
from NASA to develop a detailed 40-year climatology of snow water equivalent
(SWE) for the grassland regions of North America and Eurasia. The SWE climatology
will be produced by blending SWE estimates from a physically-based snowpack
model (SNTHERM), remotely sensed estimates (SMMR and SSM/I) and station
observations.&nbsp; The consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of
these three diverse data sets will lead to a more spatially and temporally
detailed SWE climatology than has been produced in the past for any large
region of the Earth.&nbsp; These results will be compared with those of
Goodison and Walker (1994), who have had considerable success estimating
SWE from SSM/I over the prairie region
<br>of Canada.&nbsp; Wet snow events are identified following Walker and
Goodison (1993) and are useful in computing monthly averages.
<p>5.4 Assessment of correct spatial/temporal representation of snow cover
<p>PC analysis will be applied to observed and modeled snow cover data
sets over the 17-year period to identify coherent regions of snow cover
variability following Frei et al. (1996). Comparison of rotated loading
patterns and factor score time series for significant PCs will allow an
objective assessment to be made of each model's ability to capture the
dominant spatial and temporal modes of snow cover variability over the
study period.
<p>&nbsp;5.5 Assessment of snow cover climatic and synoptic associations
<p>The relationship between interannual fluctuations in snow cover and
atmospheric circulation will be examined following Gutzler and Rosen (1992)
and Frei (1997) for both observed and modeled snow cover.&nbsp; This will
involve correlation of monthly atmospheric circulation indices (PNA, NAO,
SOI) with output from the PC analysis in 5.4, and investigation of snow
cover climatic and synoptic associations through composite (high-snow/low-snow)
analyses of surface (temperature and precipitation) and upper-air (500
mb height) data.</blockquote>
