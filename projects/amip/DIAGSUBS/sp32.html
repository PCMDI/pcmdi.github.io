<br><a name="background"></a><b>Background</b>
<p>Radiative processes are of key importance for understanding the genesis
and evolution of the global climate system. Due to recent satellite programs
such as ERBE (Earth Radiation Budget Experiment), the net exchange of radiative
energy between the global climate system and outer space is well established
(Barkstrom et al. 1990). Far larger uncertainties still exist in the knowledge
on the disposition of this energy within the climate system, such as the
partitioning of the energy absorption between the the atmosphere and the
surface, and between clouds and the cloud-free atmosphere. Large uncertainties&nbsp;
are therefore also found in the disposition of radiative energy within
different General Circulation Models (GCMs) (e.g., Randall et al. 1992,
Cess et al. 1995, Wild et al. 1995, Li et al. 1995).
<p>Reliable surface radiation data is essential to determine the absorption
of radiative energy at the surface and in the atmosphere. Few studies,
however, have attempted to compare the GCM-simulated radiative fluxes directly
with surface observations. Attempts to compare climate models using the
AMIP I model output have been limited by the data set archived that does
not include separated clear and cloudy fluxes (Potter et al. 1996).&nbsp;
The general lack of comprehensive observed surface radiative fluxes has
long limited the validation process of GCMs. Recently, the availability
and quality of surface radiation observations has been improved with the
development of two databases at the applicants' institute, which offer
now comprehensive datasets of fully quality checked surface radiation data:
The Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA, World Climate Program -Water Project
A7, Ohmura et al. 1989, Gilgen et al. 1997) and the database of the Baseline
Surface Radiation Network (Ohmura et al. 1998). GEBA is a database for
the worldwide instrumentally-measured energy fluxes at the Earth's surface
with currently 250,000 monthly mean data entries for about 1600 sites.
This dataset allows an assessment of the calculated flux climatologies
on a monthly mean basis at a large number of sites. The database of the
Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) includes only a selected number
of sites, but with observations of the highest possible accuracy at high
temporal resolution (minute values).
<p>The most extensive use of GEBA for GCM validation was made in the studies
of Wild et al .(1995a, 1995b, 1997, 1998a) using various versions of the
ECHAM GCM. The investigations showed an overestimation of the GCM-calculated
insolation at the surface, due to a lack of short-wave absorption in the
atmosphere. Indications for a lack of short-wave absorption were not just
found in the all-sky atmosphere, but also in the cloud-free GCM atmospheres
(Wild et al. 1995, Wild and Liepert 1998). In the long-wave, on the other
hand, evidence for an underestimation in the GCM-calculated downward flux
at the surface has been found. Subsets of the data now contained in GEBA
have also been used in the works of Garratt (1994), Arking (1996), and
Zhang et al. (1998), which indicate similar biases in other GCMs.
<p>The methodology used by the applicants for the validation of the ECHAM
GCM has been adopted to other models in the framework of the EU project
HIRETYCS (High Resolution Ten Year Climate Simulation), which included
the intercomparison and validation of AMIP simulations performed with high
resolution versions of the European GCMs and Re-Analysis (Wild 1997, Wild
et al. 1998b). After the expertise gained with a small number of GCMs in
the above project, the applicants plan to extend their investigations to
include state-of-the art versions of all major modeling groups. This would
allow for an overview over the ability of the latest generation of GCMs
to simulate the radiative fluxes both in the cloudy and cloud-free atmosphere.
The context of AMIP II seems the ideal framework for such an endeavor.
The time is optimal to perform this task since the implementation of the
rigorous quality control procedures in the GEBA has just been completed,
thereby ensuring an optimal quality of data which could not been guaranteed
in the prior validation studies. Furthermore, the BSRN network is now fully
operational, with currently 15 sites reporting their data to the applicants'
institute.
<p><a name="Objectives"></a><b>Objectives</b>
<p>The principal aims of this subproject are:
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assess the ability of the GCMs
participating in AMIP II to simulate the mean monthly incident short-wave
and long-wave radiation at the surface compared to more than 750 observation
sites as available from the most recent states of the GEBA and BSRN databases.
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to evaluate monthly mean GCM-calculated
climatologies of clear-sky short-wave and long-wave surface fluxes at selected
sites with measurements of high quality and high temporal resolution&nbsp;
as available from the BSRN database.
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to estimate the mean monthly short-wave
atmospheric column absorption by combining the surface climatologies used
in 1) and 2) with collocated TOA observations from satellite. This allows
an assessment of the all-sky short-wave atmospheric absorption in the GCMs
above more than 700 sites from GEBA, and both clear-sky and all-sky atmospheric
absorption at the BSRN sites.
<br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assess the model-calculated surface
and atmospheric cloud radiative forcing at sites where both clear-sky and
all-sky absorption are available (BSRN sites).
<br>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; compare trends and variability
in the GCM simulated surface radiative fluxes over the AMIP period with
observed statistics in the GEBA data as given in Gilgen et al. (1998).
<p><a name="methodology"></a><b>Methodology</b>
<p>The GCM radiative fluxes will be assessed in a pointwise comparison
between the observed and model-calculated fluxes interpolated to the observation
sites, as done in Wild et al. (1995a, 1995b, 1998a). Monthly mean observed
downward fluxes of short-wave and long-wave radiation can be readily extracted
from the GEBA and BSRN Databases. To assess the clear-sky climatology of
surface insolation in the GCMs, the applicants are currently preparing
an observational dataset of clear-sky climatologies at selected sites worldwide.
The establishment of clear-sky climatologies is only possible at sites
with observations of high temporal resolution and additional information
on cloudiness to allow for the extraction of clear-sky episodes. The data
from the BSRN database are ideal for this task as they are not only measured
at very high frequency (minutes values), but also contain extensive additional
information on the atmospheric structure above the sites (synop and radiosonde
observations). The clear-sky climatologies are then constructed from composites
of cloud-free episodes. In a pilot study, observed clear-sky climatologies
of surface insolation have been derived for a number of sites in Germany
(Wild and Liepert 1998). To obtain a reference dataset for the assessment
of the GCM absorbed short-wave radiation at the surface, the observed values
of the incoming short-wave radiation are weighted with the collocated values
taken from surface albedo climatologies as e.g. provided by the Surface
Radiation Budget Project (SRB, Darnell et al. 1992). To determine the total
absorbed solar energy in the surface-atmosphere column at the GEBA and
BSRN sites, TOA fluxes from satellite observations are used (eg. Barkstrom
et al. 1990). Finally, the atmospheric short-wave absorption above the
observation sites is determined as residual of the net flux differences
at the top of atmosphere and at the surface, respectively, as outlined
in Wild et al. (1998a).
<p><a name="Data Requirements"></a><b>Data Requirements</b>
<p>Monthly means of the different components of the surface radiation budget,
both for clear-sky and all-sky conditions are required. Of particular interest
are the downward components of the radiative fluxes as they can be most
directly be compared with surface measurements. For the assessment of the
atmospheric absorption, the radiation fluxes at the TOA are additionally
required. Data on atmospheric humidity and cloudiness are further desirable
for the interpretation of the flux biases.
