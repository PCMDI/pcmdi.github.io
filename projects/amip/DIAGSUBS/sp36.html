<a name="background"></a>Background</h1>
Feedback processes within the climate system that involve clouds and water
vapor exert a dominant influence on the way the climate responds to external
forcing. Coupled ocean-atmosphere models typically exhibit strong positive
water vapor feedback, amplifying the warming effect of enhanced greenhouse
gas concentrations (e.g., anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>). Such models also
exhibit a range of positive and negative cloud feedbacks depending on details
of the models' parameterizations of convection and microphysics. Consequently,
model-based predictions of global warming include both a strong amplifying
effect of water vapor feedback and a significant uncertainty range due
to different possible cloud feedback processes. It has proved difficult
to narrow this uncertainty range, to confirm (or refute) positive water
vapor feedback in the real-world climate sysem, or even to evaluate the
extent to which the two types of feedback are separable. Progress toward
these objectives requires a wide variety of model diagnostics, especially
those involving comparison of model-simulated quantities with observational
data.
<p>We propose to examine AMIP II model output using two new diagnostics
related to cloud and water vapor feedback. Two existing AMIP II subprojects
are examining the general characteristics of model-simulated clouds and
water vapor: No. 13, "Evaluation of Global Cloudiness" (B. Weare), and
No. 27, "Tropospheric Humidity and Meridional Moisture Fluxes" (D. Gaffen,
R. Rosen D. Salstein, J. Boyle, B. Soden). We do not anticipate that these
subprojects will employ the diagnostics proposed below, but we will maintain
close contact with Weare and Boyle to prevent duplication of effort. An
additional AMIP II subproject -- No. 34, "Evaluation of Convection and
Upper Level Moisture and their Links Using Meteosat Water Vapor Channel
Data" (R. Roca and L. Picon) -- will use specialized diagnostics that appear
to be largely unrelated to ours.
<h1>
<a name="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h1>
We propose to compare AMIP II model simulations with observations during
the AMIP II period (1979-1996) of the following tropical phenomena:
<ol>
<li>
Correlations involving interannual variations of water vapor and temperature</li>

<li>
Correlations between cloud area and underlying sea surface temperature</li>
</ol>
Item (1) has been investigated in several studies, but typically results
from only one or two models have been considered in each study. Item (2)
has not previously been investigated with the particular method discussed
below.
<h1>
<a name="methodology"></a>Methodology</h1>
For Item (1) we will repeat the major diagnostics employed by Sun and Held
(1996) on the complete set of AMIP II model simulations. For example, Figure
9 in Sun and Held's paper indicates that correlations between interannual
variations of water vapor at different atmospheric levels are much stronger
in their model than in the real world. Our preliminary results from the
public-domain AMIP I database reveal similar results from all of these
models (see calc_r.ps, available on the anonymous FTP server sprite.llnl.gov
in subdirectory pub/covey/IPCC). The discrepancy between models and observations
appears to be independent of model characteristics such as vertical resolution
or convective parameterization. On the other hand, the AMIP I model family
is several years old, and it will be interesting to see if the more recent
models from AMIP II give significantly different results when this diagnostic
(and others from Sun and Held) are applied to their output.
<p>It should be noted that the observational data employed by Sun and Held
is open to criticism. The observations were obtained from radiosondes whose
high-altitude measurements are questionable, and whose coverage of the
tropics is sparse. In our subproject we will employ satellite and reanalysis
data where possible, in addition to updated radiosonde data. When comparing
with the radiosonde data, we will use a subset of model output that matches
the space-time coverage of the observations. Del Genio (personal communication)
has found that this technique reduces the disagreement between the radiosondes
and the GISS GCM.
<p>For Item (2) we will extend our current work, which compares recent
satellite observations of the tropical Pacific (30S-30N, 130E-170W; Jan
1998 - Aug 1999) with simulations by a GCM including the NCAR CCM3 subgridscale
physics. In the observations we find a large, robust negative correlation
between high elevation cloud cover and cloud-weighted SST. Our use of cloud-weighted
rather than actual SST was motivated by our assumption that cloud area
is proportional to ice detrainment by cumulus, which depends on the temperature
dependent stochastic coalescence in the cumuli. In that case, the only
temperature relevant to the process is the temperature as seen by the clouds.
For the periods studied, most of the change in cloud weighted SST comes
from movement of the clouds rather than actual changes in SST.
<p>We have found that our model simulations completely fail to replicate
the observed cloud area dependence. This result is not surprising since
CCM3 physics uses diagnostic clouds. However, several AMIP II models (and
indeed several AMIP I models) use prognostic cloud schemes. We therefore
wish to repeat our cloud area / cloud-weighted SST study with the complete
AMIP II results. Although the AMIP II period does not overlap the period
of our observational data, we believe that for a given model, any 1-2 year
period from the full AMIP II time span will give results similar to those
from any other 1-2 year period. We will test this assumption by examining
several 1-2 year periods for each model.
<h1>
<a name="Data Requirements"></a>Data requirements</h1>
For Item (1) we require monthly mean air temperature and specific humidity
(ta and hus). For Item (2) we require monthly mean SST (ts) and high-time-frequency
cloud amounts. If the optional 6-hourly total cloud cover (clt) has been
supplied by a sufficient number of AMIP II models, then we will use this
quantity. Otherwise we will deduce cloud amounts as best we can from 6-hourly
OLR (rlut). We will also examine the analogous AMIP I output for Item (2),
as we already have for Item (1).
