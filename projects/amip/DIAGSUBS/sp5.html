<p>Simulations made with coupled ocean-atmosphere models frequently "drift"
away from the observed climate. The situation has improved in recent years
(e.g., Boville et al., 1997), but the tuning required to minimize this
drift remains a sensitive and unfortunate necessity. Identifying and understanding
biases in the simulated air-sea exchange of heat, momentum and buoyancy
is an important step towards resolving the climate drift in coupled ocean-atmosphere
models.&nbsp;&nbsp; AMIP offers the opportunity to examine in detail surface
fluxes simulated with AGCMs constrained by realistic sea surface temperatures
(SST) and sea-ice conditions. This serves as a useful test to examine the
readiness of an AGCM to be successfully (minimal drift) coupled to an OGCM.
<p>For many of the AMIP I simulations the implied ocean heat transport
in the Southern Hemisphere was equatorward. These unrealistic transports
resulted from deficiencies in the simulated cloud-radiative effects (Gleckler
et al., 1995). Additionally, systematic biases in the simulated surface
heat fluxes were identified by direct comparison with observationally-based
estimates (Randall and Gleckler, 1996 and Gleckler and Weare, 1997).

<a name="Objectives"></a><b>Objectives and&nbsp;<a name="methodology"></a>Methodology</b>
<p>Simulated ocean surface fluxes and their implied meridional transports
need to be studied in further detail. The continuing primary objective
of this subproject is to identify and explain systematic errors by making
use of the best available observations.&nbsp; The emphasis on seasonal
climatologies (and not interannual variability) reflects that: 1) despite
prescribed SSTs, AGCMs do not yet adequetly simulate the seasonal cycle
of surface heat fluxes (Randall and Gleckler, 1996), and 2) observations
are sparse, and consequently it is believed that available composite climatologies
are more credible than estimates of interannual variability. However, several
recent satellite products show promise in capturing interannual variability
during part of the AMIP II period, and may deserve consideration for comparison
with the simulations. Regional field studies (e.g., TOGA-COARE intensive
flux array) may also prove useful.&nbsp; The proposed research consists
of the following:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Evaluation of simulated global ocean seasonal climatologies of&nbsp; a)
all terms of the surface energy balance b) surface wind stress c) buoyancy
(freshwater flux)</li>

<li>
Evaluation of the annual mean implied meridional transports of heat, momentum
and density in the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and global oceans</li>

<li>
Attempt to identify the reasons for existing surface flux and transport
biases (e.g., Gleckler et al., 1995).</li>

<dir><u>Validation data:</u>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
Determination of appropriate validation data is a challenging task for
this subproject. There now exist multiple techniques to estimate ocean
surface fluxes (e.g., surface and satellite observations), and each one
of them suffers from shortcomings hard to quantify. Recently, a working
group on air-sea fluxes was established by the Joint Scientific Committee
and the Scientific Committee on Oceanographic Research (JSC/SCOR air-sea
working group). Primary tasks of this working group include preparing a
catalogue and documentation of existing flux atlases and estimation of
their uncertainties.&nbsp; Ultimately the working group will report their
findings (including recommended estimates) to JSC, SCOR and scientific
community.&nbsp; The goals of the working group closely parallel Gleckler's
primary research, and as a he will be well informed of progress. Hydrographic
transect estimates now underway as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) will also be studied by the air-sea working group. The
resulting "direct" meridional transport estimates are often used to adjust
surface flux estimates using inverse techniques (cf., da Silva and Levitus,
1995).
<p>Because of the large uncertainties associated with "state-of-the-art"
observational estimates, it is likely that many of them will continue to
be compared with models.&nbsp; Randall and Gleckler (1996) found that despite
the large differences between the observational estimates, collectively
they have helped to identify several important model biases.&nbsp; Thus
it is expected that a diverse collection of observations will be used to
study the AMIP simulations, including a variety of surface and satellite
based estimates, reanalysis, and field studies.
