and model output compression</font></i></center>


<p>Perspectives of the AMIP Panel, the PCMDI staff, and many others have
formed the basis for the AMIP II Standard Model Output sampling and interpolation
recommendations. However, the implications of some of these recommendations
are not yet fully understood. <a href="sampstudy.html">Tests</a> are underway
to examine the effects of these recommendations (published in the guidelines
for AMIP II) on model validation and intercomparison. Here, questions are
addressed concerning these recommendations. <b><font color="#000000">Questions

<p><a name="avgonp"></a><font color="#0000FF">Should 3-d fields be time
averaged before or after interpolation to pressure surfaces?</font>

<p>In the AMIP II Guidelines no recommendation was made for vertical interpolation
because there is no single method of interpolation that is most appropriate
for all fields and models. However, <i>how</i> to interpolate and <i>when</i>
to interpolate are very different questions. Some groups have expressed
that their job-stream is more practical when quantities are averaged on
model surfaces and then interpolated to pressure surfaces. With this approach,
the average surface pressure is used for interpolation, despite the temporal
pressure fluctuations at each model level. The resulting inaccuracies are
not well known, and are likely to be variable dependent. This is the first
issue addressed in a sampling/interpolation study. Preliminary results
suggest that the effects of the ordering of interpolation for most fields
is not critical, and thus if it is not the same for all AMIP simulations
the resulting biases should not be too severe. However, when interpolating
to pressure surfaces, it is recommended that these calculations be done
as correctly as possible (i.e., accumulate each model time step on pressure
surfaces). This is particularly important if cloud related fields are being
interpolated to pressure surfaces. When the results of the sampling study
become available, they may assist modeling groups in making their own judgements.
The results of this study will also serve as a reference of potential bias
in the output provided by groups who average on model surfaces and then
interpolate to pressure.

<p><a name="nottop"></a><a name="Are_there_scientific_reasons_for_not_int"></a><font color="#0000FF">Should
all 3-d fields be interpolated to standard pressure surfaces?</font>

<p>Conceptually there should be no problem with defining most of the AMIP
II 3-d quantities on pressure surfaces. Budget calculations with these
data will only be approximations, and most features of fields that vary
relatively smoothly in the vertical should not be lost when interpolating
to standard pressure surfaces. However, fields with sharp vertical gradients
or discontinuities such as cloud cover (and other cloud-related fields)
may be significantly compromised by the interpolation to standard pressure
levels. Preliminary tests help to quantify the severity of this. Nevertheless,
the treatment of such fields varies substantially from one model to the
next, and thus whether or not to provide cloud related fields (Table 1C)
on model surfaces or standard pressure levels is to be decided by each
modeling group. Clearly further study of this issue is necessary.
