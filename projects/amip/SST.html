<h1>AMIP Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice:</h1>
<b>Observational and Boundary Condition Data Sets</b></p>
<p>The AMIP SST and sea ice boundary conditions are available at this site. Two distinctly different data sets have been prepared.
The first contains observed monthly mean SSTs, which area are provided and updated following a procedure described by
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1175/2008JCLI2292.1" target="_blank">Hurrell et al. (2008)</a>. This dataset, which at this site became
available in 2007, supercedes the original AMIP II observational data set described <a href="/projects/amip/amip2/index.html">here</a>.
There are differences between the earlier dataset and the present one which are generally small but not entirely negligible.</p>

<p>The second data set is the AMIP SST and sea ice <b>boundary conditions</b> derived from the observational data set as described
in this <a href="details/index.html">web document</a>. This data <b>should be used in the AMIP simulations</b>. The primary difference
between the boundary condition data set and the observational data set is that adjustments have been made to insure that when
daily values are linearly interpolated between the monthly values contained in the data set (i.e., when used as boundary
conditions for an AGCM), <i>the monthly average of the observations is preserved</i>. Monthly averages are not preserved when
daily values are obtained by linearly intepolated between monthly mean observations (as in AMIP I). When the boundary
condition data (as opposed to the observed monthly means) are used for an AGCM simulation, it has been shown that in addition
to preserving the observational monthly means, the seasonal cycle and the interannual variance are more accurately represented
than the method used in AMIP I.</p>
