<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>This study investigates monsoon variability on intraseasonal and interannual
time scales and the associated monsoon predictability, using two 10-year
ECMWF AMIP integrations, which differ only in their initial conditions.
The results indicate that the model has large intraseasonal variability
which is spatially correlated with the interannual one. Empirical orthogonal
function analysis and canonical correlation analysis are used to identify
the most important components of variability in the precipitation and vorticity
fields. The leading pair of CCA modes is able to describe most of the model
intraseasonal fluctuations. The first vorticity mode describes the weakening/strengthening
of the monsoon low and the corresponding precipitation mode describes the
two preferred "regimes" of the ITCZ. The continental regime is located
north of 10&deg;N and it covers most of the land while the oceanic regime
is located south of 10 degreesN. The nature of the intraseasonal fluctuations
appears to be mostly chaotic. The interannual variability can be also described
in terms of CCA modes. The seasonal mean monsoon circulation appears to
be predictable.
