<B>Gleckler, P. J</B>. and W. L. Gates, 1995: AMIP II: PCMDI
proposal. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference,
Monterey, California, 116.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">AMIP has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity
to evaluate AGCMs, and the PCMDI has been urged to improve and extend this
program of model intercomparison. This conference represents an important
milestone for AMIP and an appropriate forum to begin discussions concerning
the future of AMIP. We are proposing an improved project, to be referred
to as AMIP II, for three principal reasons: 1) to make use of the refined
and expanded surface boundary conditions which are the basis of the NMC
and ECMWF reanalyses and to extend the simulations over a longer period
of time, 2) to expand and reformulate the Standard Output in order to better
meet the needs of the diagnostic community, and 3) to more efficiently
manage the collection, quality control and distribution of both modeled
and observed data in support of a widening range of model diagnoses and
intercomparisons.
