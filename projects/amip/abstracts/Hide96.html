1996: Atmospheric angular momentum fluctuations in global circulation models

<BR>Changes in major global dynamical phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere
are manifested in the time series of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM).
as determined directly from meteorological observations and indirectly
from geodetic observations of small fluctuations in the rotation of the
solid Earth that are proportional to length of day (LOD). AAM fluctuations
are intimately linked with energetic processes throughout the whole atmosphere.
and also with the stresses at the Earth's surface produced largely by turbulent
momentum transport in the oceanic and continental boundary layers and by
the action of normal pressure forces on orographic features. A stringent
test of any numerical global circulation model (GCM) is therefore provided
by a quantitative assessment of its ability to represent AAM fluctuations
on all relevant time scales, ranging from months to several years. From
monthly data provided by the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(AMIP) of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), we have investigated
seasonal and interannual fluctuations and the decadal mean in the axial
component of AAM in 23 AMIP GCMs over the period 1979-1988. The decadal
means are generally well simulated. with the model median value (1.58 x
10<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>26</FONT></SUP> kg m<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT></SUP>
s<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>-1</FONT></SUP>) being only 3.5% larger than the observed
mean and with 10 of the models being within 5% of the observed. The seasonal
cycle is well reproduced, with the median amplitude of the models' seasonal
standard deviations being only 2.4% larger than observed. Half the seasonal
amplitudes lie within 15% of the observed and the median correlation found
between the observed and model seasonal cycles is 0.95. The dominant seasonal
error is an underestimation of AAM during Northern Hemisphere winter associated
with errors in the position of subtropical jets. Less robust are the modeled
interannual variations, though the median correlation of 0.61 between model
simulation and observed AAM is statistically significant. The two El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events that occurred during the AMIP decade 1979-1988
have the expected positive AAM anomalies, though the AAM signature of the
1982-1983 event tends to be underestimated, and that of the 1986-1987 event
overestimated.
