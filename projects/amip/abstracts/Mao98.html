<b>Mao, J.</b> and alan Robock 1998: Surface air temperature
simulations by AMIP general circulation models: volcanic and ENSO signals
and systematic errors.&nbsp; <i>Journal of Climate,</i> <b>11</b>, 1538–1552.
<hr width="100%"><font size=+0>Thirty surface air temperature simulations
for 1979–88 by 29 atmospheric general circulation models are analyzed and
compared with the observations over land. These models were run as part
of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). Several simulations
showed serious systematic errors, up to 4&deg;–5&deg;C, in globally averaged
land air temperature. The 16 best simulations gave rather realistic reproductions
of the mean climate and seasonal cycle of global land air temperature,
with an average error of&nbsp;0.9&deg;C
for the 10-yr period. The general coldness of the model simulations is
consistent with previous intercomparison studies. The regional systematic
errors showed very large cold biases in areas with topography and permanent
ice, which implies a common deficiency in the representation of snow-ice
albedo in the diverse models. The SST and sea ice specification of climatology
rather than observations at high latitudes for the first three years (1979–81)
caused a noticeable drift in the neighboring land air temperature simulations,
compared to the rest of the years (1982–88). Unsuccessful simulation of
the extreme warm (1981) and cold (1984–85) periods implies that some variations
are chaotic or unpredictable, produced by internal atmospheric dynamics
and not forced by global SST patterns.</font><font size=+0></font>
<p><font size=+0>Among the 16 best simulations, 8 reproduced the dominant
El Ni&ntilde;o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) mode in the 10-yr period, which
includes the 1982–83 and 1986–87 warm episodes and the 1988 cold episode.
On the average, the ENSO mode explains about 30% of the total variance
in surface air temperature fluctuation and has a 2-month lag from the Southern
Oscillation index. In this mode, North America displays a Pacific–North
American–like anomaly pattern, but Eurasia gave little response to warm
SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific, in good agreement with results
based on historical data.</font><font size=+0></font>
<p><font size=+0>The special design of the AMIP experiment provides a unique
opportunity to estimate the effects of the El Chich&oacute;n volcanic eruption
in spring 1982, which was not included in the model forcing. Comparison
of the simulations with data delineated a visible global cooling in the
first months following the El Chich&oacute;n eruption, in addition to the
cooling from the volcanic eruption of Nyamuragira in December 1981, due
to the reduction of incoming solar radiation by volcanic aerosols. However,
the mean climate shift in the AMIP experiment due to the forcing data discontinuity
at the end of 1981 made the quantitative estimate of El Chich&oacute;n
global cooling influence impossible. The contrast between the simulated
ENSO signal and observations shows that the major warming over the northern
continents during the 1982/83 winter (DJF) is not an ENSO-like signal.
Instead it is most likely a pattern resulting from the enhanced polar vortex
produced by a larger pole-to-equator temperature gradient. This gradient
was due to the larger absorption of radiation in low latitudes by the El
Chich&oacute;n volcanic sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere. These results
suggest that during the Northern Hemisphere wintertime, the stratospheric
polar vortex has substantial influence on surface air temperature fluctuations
through its effects on vertically propagating planetary waves of the troposphere,
and imply that current GCMs are deficient in simulation of stratospheric
processes and their coupling with the troposphere.</font>
