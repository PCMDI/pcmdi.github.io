<B>Robock, A.,</B> C. Schlosser, K. Vinnikov, S. Liu, N. Speranskaya,
and J. Entin, 1996: Soil moisture parameterization in GCMS and evaluation
of AMIP simulations. <I>Earth Interactions</I> (submitted).
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) conducted simulations
by 30 different atmospheric general circulation models forced by observed
sea surface temperatures for the 10-year period, 1979-1988. These models
include a variety of different soil moisture parameterizations which influence
their simulations of the entire land surface hydrology, including evaporation,
soil moisture, and runoff, and their simulations of the energy balance
at the surface. Here we compare these parameterizations, and evaluate their
simulations of soil moisture by comparing them with actual observations
of soil moisture, literally ground truth. We compared model-generated "data
sets" and simulations of soil moisture with more than 200 observations
taken in the former Soviet Union for 1979-1985, the People's Republic of
China for 1981-1991, and Illinois for 1981-present. The spatial patterns,
mean annual cycles, and interannual variations were compared to plant-available
soil moisture in the upper 1 m of soil.

<P>The "data sets" of Mintz and Serafini and Schemm et al. and the AMIP
model output are quite different from the observations. The "data sets"
are quite different from each other in many regions, even though they use
the same calculation method. The model simulations are also quite different
from each other, especially in the tropics. Models with 15-cm field capacities
do not capture the large high latitude values of soil moisture. In addition,
none of the models properly simulate winter soil moisture variations in
high latitudes. They all keep soil moisture constant when the temperature
is below freezing, while observations show that soil moisture varies in
the winter as much as in other seasons. The observed interannual variations
of soil moisture were not captured by any of the AMIP models. Several models
have large soil moisture trends during the first year or two of the AMIP
simulations, with potentially large impacts on global hydrological cycle
trends and on other climate elements. This is because the simulations were
begun without spinning up the soil moisture to the model climatology. The
length of time it took for each to reach equilibrium depended on the particular
parameterization. Although observed temporal autocorrelation time scales
are a few months, some models had much longer time scales than that. In
particular, the 3 parameterizations based on SiB had severe trends in some
regions for virtually the entire AMIP simulation period.
