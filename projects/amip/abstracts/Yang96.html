<B>Yang, S., </B>K. -M Lau and M. Sankar-Rao, 1996: Precursory signals
associated with the internannual variability of the Asian summer monsoon.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>In this work, the interannual variability of the Asian summer monsoon
is studied by analyzing outputs of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project integration using the Goddard laboratory for Atmospheres general
circulation model. The main effort is devoted to exploring and understanding
precursory signals associated with the interannual variability of the Asian
monsoon and deciphering possible physical mechanisms responsible for the
signals.

<P>It is found that strong precursory signals of highly anomalous Asian
summer monsoon appear over the subtropical Asian region during the previous
winter-spring seasons. prior to a strong summer monsoon, the westerlies
over subtropical Asia are weaker than normal, and vice versa. Dynamically
consistent changes are found in other fields such as atmospheric temperature,
geopotential height, and surface temperature. These precursory signals
seem to have a barotropic, structure in the troposphere. They exist over
a broad region and last for two to three seasons. The robustness of the
signals is important for improving seasonal prediction of the Asian summer
monsoon.

<P>It is hypothesized that the above-described precursory signals of the
Asian summer monsoon are linked to land-surface hydrologic processes, such
as changes in snow mass and soil moisture in the Asian continent, as well
as anomalous sea surface temperature forcing in the Pacific and Indian
Oceans. Evidence in support of the above hypothesis can be found in the
variability of a variety of parameters from both model simulation and observations.
