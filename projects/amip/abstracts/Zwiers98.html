<B>&nbsp;Zwiers, F.</B> and&nbsp; V. Kharin, 1998:&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=+0>Intercomparison
of interannual variability and potential predictability: an AMIP diagnostic

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The inter-annual variability and potential predictability of 850 hPa
temperature (<I>T</I><SUB>850</SUB>), 500 hPa geopotential (&lt;phi><SUB>500</SUB>)
and 300 hPa stream function (&lt;psi><SUB>300</SUB>) simulated by the models
participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) are
examined. The total inter-annual variability is partitioned into a potentially
predictable component which arises from the forcing implied by the prescribed
SST and sea-ice evolution, or from sources internal to the simulated climate,
and an unpredictable low frequency component induced by "weather noise".
There is wide variation in the ability to simulate observed inter-annual
variability, both total and weather-noise induced. A majority of models
under simulate seasonal mean &lt;phi><SUB>500</SUB> variability in DJF
and JJA and over simulate &lt;psi><SUB>300</SUB> variability in JJA. All
but one model simulates less <I>T</I><SUB>850</SUB> total inter-annual
variability than in the analysed data. There is little apparent connection
between gross model characteristics and the corresponding ability to simulate
observed variability, with the possible exceptions of resolution.
