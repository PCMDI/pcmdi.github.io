<h1 align="center">Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project</h1>
<p align="center">MIP is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). It provides a community-based infrastructure in support of climate model diagnosis, validation, intercomparison, documentation and data access.  This framework enables a diverse community of scientists to analyze AGCMs in a systematic fashion, a process which serves to facilitate model improvement.  Virtually the entire <a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/STATUS/incoming.html">international climate modeling community</a> has participated in this project since its inception in 1990.
</p>
<p align="center">AMIP-style simulations are routinely performed at many climate and NWP centers during model development in order to evaluate atmospheric model performance and identify errors. The systematic intercomparison of atmospheric model components is currently being coordinated under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP),
    which includes AMIP simulations as an integral part.</p>
