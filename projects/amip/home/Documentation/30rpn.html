<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">Model Designation
</a></h3>
RPN NWP-D40P29 (T63 L23) 1993
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">Model Lineage
</a></h3>
The RPN model derives from research on application of the semi-Lagrangian
method (cf. Ritchie 1985
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>, 1986
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>, 1987
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a>, 1988
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn3">[4]</a>, 1991
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn4">[5]</a>), and from physical parameterizations in use in other models at this institution.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">Model Documentation
</a></h3>
The semi-Lagrangian numerics are described by Ritchie (1991)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>, and the finite
element discretization by Beland and Beaudoin (1985)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn5">[6]</a>. Descriptions of some physical
parameterizations are provided by Benoit et al. (1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a>.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Numerical/Computational
Properties
</a></h2>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">Horizontal Representation
</a></h3>
Semi-Lagrangian spectral (spherical harmonic basis functions) with
transformation to a Gaussian grid for calculation of nonlinear quantities and
some physics.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC8">Horizontal Resolution
</a></h3>
Spectral triangular 63 (T63), roughly equivalent to 1.9 x 1.9 degrees
latitude-longitude.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">Vertical Domain
</a></h3>
Surface to about 10 hPa. For a surface pressure of 1000 hPa, the lowest
atmospheric level is at 1000 hPa (using a nonstaggered vertical grid).
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC10">Vertical Representation
</a></h3>
Finite-element sigma coordinates. (Some changes in the form of the vertical
discretization of the model equations are required to produce a formulation
appropriate for use of the semi-Lagrangian method--cf. Ritchie 1991
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>.)
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC11">Vertical Resolution
</a></h3>
There are 23 unevenly spaced sigma levels. For a surface pressure of 1000 hPa,
7 levels are below 800 hPa and 7 levels are above 200 hPa.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC12">Computer/Operating System
</a></h3>
The AMIP simulation was run on a NEC SX-3 computer using a single processor in a UNIX operating environment.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC13">Computational Performance
</a></h3>
For the AMIP experiment, about 4 minutes computation time per simulated day.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC14">Initialization</a>
</h3>
For the AMIP simulation, the model atmosphere, soil moisture, and snow
cover/depth are initialized for 1 December 1978 from FGGE analyses and
climatological datasets. An adiabatic nonlinear normal mode initialization
after Machenauer (1977)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn7">[8]</a> is also applied. The
model is then integrated forward to the nominal AMIP start date of 1 January
1979.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC15">Time Integration Scheme(s)
</a></h3>
A semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian time integration scheme with an Asselin
(1972)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn8">[9]</a> frequency filter is used (cf. Ritchie
1991)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>. Vertical diffusion and surface temperatures and fluxes are computed
implicitly (cf. Benoit et al. 1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a>. The time step is 30 minutes for dynamics
and physics, except for full calculations of shortwave and longwave radiative
fluxes, which are done every 3 hours. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC16">Smoothing/Filling</a></h3>
Orography is smoothed (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC29">Orography</a>). Negative values of atmospheric
specific humidity are temporarily zeroed for use in physical parameterizations,
but are not permanently filled. The solution in spectral space imposes an
approximate conservation of total mass of the atmosphere.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC17">Sampling Frequency
</a></h3>
For the AMIP simulation, the model history is written every 12 hours.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">Dynamical/Physical Properties
</a></h2>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC19">Atmospheric Dynamics
</a></h3>
Primitive-equation dynamics expressed in terms of the horizontal vector wind,
surface pressure, specific humidity, and temperature are formulated in a
semi-Lagrangian framework (cf. Ritchie 1991)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC20">Diffusion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>	Second-order (del^2) horizontal diffusion is applied to spectral
vorticity, divergence, temperature, and specific humidity on constant-sigma
surfaces. All diffusivity coefficients are 10^5 m^2/s.
<p>
<li>	Vertical diffusion is represented by the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE)
closure scheme described by Benoit et al. (1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> and Mailhot and Benoit
(1982)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn9">[10]</a>. Prognostically determined TKE is
produced by shear and buoyancy, and is depleted by viscous dissipation.
Vertical (but not horizontal) transport of TKE is also modeled, and a minimum background TKE (10^-4 m^2/s^2) is always present. Diffusion coefficients for momentum and heat/moisture are determined from the current value of TKE and from a locally defined stability-dependent turbulence mixing length. See also
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC28">Planetary Boundary Layer</a> and <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</a>. </ul><h3>
<a name="RTFToC21">Gravity-wave Drag
</a></h3>
Subgrid-scale parameterization of gravity-wave drag follows the method of
McFarlane (1987)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn10">[11]</a>. Deceleration of resolved
flow by breaking/dissipation of orographically excited gravity waves is a
function of atmospheric density and the vertical shear of the product of three
terms: the Brunt-Vaisalla frequency, the component of local wind in the
direction of a near-surface reference level, and a displacement amplitude that
is bound by the lesser of the subgrid-scale orographic variance (see
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC29">Orography</a>) or a wave-saturation value.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC22">Solar Constant/Cycles
</a></h3>
The solar constant is the AMIP-prescribed value of 1365 W/(m^2). Both seasonal and diurnal cycles in solar forcing are simulated.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC23">Chemistry</a></h3>
The carbon dioxide concentration is the AMIP-prescribed value of 345 ppm.
Monthly climatological zonal profiles of ozone are prescribed after data of
Kita and Sumi (1986)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn11">[12]</a>. Radiative effects of
water vapor are also included, but not those of other greenhouse gases or of
aerosols (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</a>).
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC24">Radiation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>	The outputs of the shortwave and longwave radiation schemes are the fluxes
at each level and the heating rates in each layer. Fluxes also interact with
the model at the surface, where the energy balance determines the surface
temperature (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</a> and <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</a>). 
<p>
<li>	The shortwave parameterization after Fouquart and Bonnel (1980)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn12">[13]</a> considers the effects of carbon dioxide and
ozone (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC23">Chemistry</a>), water vapor, clouds, and liquid water. When
clouds are present, liquid water is diagnosed from atmospheric temperature: a
fraction of the maximum theoretical liquid water concentration on a wet adiabat
is assumed, following Betts and Harshvardhan (1987)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn13">[14]</a>. The entire visible spectrum is treated as a single interval.
<p>
<li>	The longwave parameterizations after Garand (1983)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn14">[15]</a> and Garand and Mailhot (1990)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn15">[16]</a> include the same constituents as in the
shortwave scheme, except that liquid water is not interactive. The frequency
integration is carried out over 4 spectral intervals: the carbon dioxide
15-micron band divided into center and wing components, the 9.3-micron ozone
band, and the rest of the infrared spectrum, including absorption bands for
water vapor and continuum absorption. (The frequency integration is precomputed
for different temperatures and absorber amounts, with the results stored in
look-up tables.) All clouds are assumed to behave as blackbodies (emissivity of
1.0) and to be fully overlapped in the vertical. See also <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC26">Cloud Formation</a>.</ul><h3>
<a name="RTFToC25">Convection</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>	A modified Kuo (1974)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn16">[17]</a> scheme is used
to parameterize the effects of deep precipitation-forming convection. When the
large-scale vertical motion at the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is
upward and the free atmosphere above the PBL top (at about 900 hPa) is
conditionally unstable, the assumed convective activity depends on the net
moisture accession in the atmospheric column that is provided by both surface evaporation and large-scale moisture convergence. This moisture is partitioned between a fraction b which moistens the environment, and the remainder (1 - b) which contributes to the latent heating (precipitation) rate. Following Anthes (1977)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn17">[18]</a>, the moistening parameter b is
determined as a cubic function of the ratio of the mean relative humidity of
the cloud layer to a prescribed critical relative humidity threshold value; if
the cloud relative humidity is less than the threshold, b is set to unity (no
heating of the environment). The vertical distribution of the heating or
moistening is according to differences between mean-cloud and large-scale
profiles of temperature and moisture. The mean-cloud profiles are computed from
the parcel method slightly modified by an entrainment height of 20 km.
<p>
<li>	Shallow convection is parameterized by a generalization of the PBL
turbulence formulation (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC20">Diffusion</a>) to include the case of partially
saturated air in the conditionally unstable layer above an unstable boundary
layer. First, a convective cloud fraction is diagnosed from a relation based on
the Bjerknes slice method; then the buoyancy and all the turbulent fluxes are
calculated, assuming condensation occurs in that layer fraction. The main
effect of the parameterization is to enhance the vertical moisture transport in
the absence of large-scale moisture convergence. See also <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC28">Planetary Boundary Layer</a>.</ul><h3>
<a name="RTFToC26">Cloud Formation
</a></h3>
Convective and stable cloud fractions are diagnosed separately and then
combined to interact with the radiative fluxes (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</a>). In
supersaturated, absolutely stable layers, a stable cloud fraction of unity is
assigned. In layers where shallow or deep convection is diagnosed, the cloud
fraction is determined from the pertinent portion of the convective scheme (see
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC25">Convection</a>).
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC27">Precipitation</a></h3>
Large-scale precipitation forms as a result of condensation in supersaturated
layers that are absolutely stable, and shallow convective precipitation in
conditionally unstable layers. Deep convective precipitation also forms in
association with latent heating in the Kuo (1974)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn16">[17]</a> scheme (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC25">Convection</a>). There is subsequent evaporation of large-scale
precipitation only.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC28">Planetary Boundary Layer
</a></h3>
The depth of the unstable PBL is determined from the profile of static
stability. The depth of the stable PBL is diagnosed using the Monin-Obukhov
length. See also <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC20">Diffusion</a> and <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</a>.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC29">Orography</a></h3>
The raw topography are from the U.S. Navy data with 10-minutes arc resolution (cf. Josseph 1980)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn18">[19]</a> obtained from the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). These heights are
spectrally filtered and truncated at the T63 model resolution. The orographic
variances required for the gravity-wave drag parameterization (see
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC21">Gravity-wave Drag</a>) are also determined from the same dataset. Cf. Pellerin and Benoit (1987)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn19">[20]</a> for further details.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC30">Ocean</a></h3>
AMIP monthly sea surface temperature fields are prescribed, with daily values
determined by linear interpolation.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC31">Sea Ice
</a></h3>
AMIP monthly sea ice extents are prescribed. The surface temperature of sea ice
is predicted by the force-restore method of Deardorff (1978)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn20">[21]</a> in the same way as for land points (see
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</a>), without consideration of subsurface heat
conduction through the ice. Snow cover is not accounted for on sea ice (see
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC32">Snow Cover</a>). Cf. Benoit et al. (1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> for further details.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC32">Snow Cover
</a></h3>
Snow mass is not a prognostic variable, and a snow budget is therefore not
included. Snow cover over land is prescribed from the monthly climatology of Louis (1984)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn21">[22]</a>, but snow is not specified on
sea ice (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC31">Sea Ice</a>). Snow cover alters the albedo (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics</a>), but not the heat capacity/conductivity of the surface.
Sublimation of snow contributes to surface evaporation (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</a>), but soil moisture is not affected by snowmelt (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</a>). Cf. Benoit et al. (1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> for further details.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics
</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>	Over land, surface roughness lengths that are functions of orography and
vegetation are specified after Louis (1984)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn21">[22]</a>. Over sea ice, the prescribed
roughness length ranges between 1.5 x 10^-5 and 5 x 10^-3 m. Over ocean, the
roughness length is treated as a function of the surface wind stress after the
method of Charnock (1955)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn22">[23]</a>.
<p>
<li>	Surface albedos do not depend on solar zenith angle or spectral interval.
On land, the surface albedo is specified from annual background values
(provided by the Canadian Climate Centre) modulated with the monthly ice
(albedo 0.70) and snow (albedo 0.80) climatology (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC32">Snow Cover</a>). The
albedo of ocean points is specified to be a uniform 0.07.
<p>
<li>	The surface longwave emissivity is prescribed as 0.95 over land and sea
ice and as 1.0 (blackbody emission) over ocean.</ul><h3>
<a name="RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes </a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>	The surface solar absorption is determined from surface albedos, and
longwave emission from the Planck equation with prescribed surface
emissivities (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics</a>).
<p>
<li>	Following Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, the surface turbulent momentum,
sensible heat, and moisture fluxes are expressed as bulk formulae, with drag
and transfer coefficients that are functions of surface roughness length (see
<a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics</a>) and of stability (expressed as a bulk
Richardson number computed between level sigma = 0.99 and the surface). The
same transfer coefficient is used for the heat and moisture fluxes.
<p>
<li>	The flux of surface moisture also depends on an evapotranspiration
efficiency factor b that is unity over oceans, sea ice, and snow, but that is
prescribed as a monthly wetness fraction over land (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</a>).
<p>
<li>	Above the surface layer, the turbulence closure scheme after Mailhot and
Benoit (1982)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn9">[10]</a> and Benoit et al. (1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> is used to determine momentum, heat, and
moisture fluxes. See also <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC20">Diffusion</a> and <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC28">Planetary Boundary Layer</a>.
</ul><h3>
<a name="RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes
</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>	The surface temperature of soil (and of sea ice) is computed by the
force-restore method of Deardorff (1978)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn20">[21]</a>. The upper boundary condition is a net
balance of surface energy fluxes (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</a>), and monthly deep
temperatures are prescribed as a lower boundary condition. The thermodynamic
properties are those characteristic of clay soil, and the depth of the soil
layer is taken to be that of the penetration of the diurnal heat wave. The same
properties are also used for predicting the temperature of sea ice (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC31">Sea Ice</a>). 
<p>
<li>	Soil moisture (expressed as a wetness fraction) is prescribed from monthly
climatologies of Louis (1981)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn23">[24]</a>.
Precipitation and snowmelt therefore do not influence soil moisture, and runoff
is not accounted for; however, the prescribed wetness fraction does affect
surface evaporation (see <a href="30rpn.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</a>). Cf. Benoit et al. (1989)
<a href="30rpn_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> for further details.</ul>
