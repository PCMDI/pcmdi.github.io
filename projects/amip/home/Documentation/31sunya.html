<H3> <A NAME="RTFToC3"></A>Model Designation </H3>

<P>SUNYA CCM1-TG (R15 L12) 1990 </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC4"></A>Model Lineage </H3>

<P>The SUNYA model is identical to the standard version 1 of the NCAR Community
Climate Model (CCM1), except for the addition of radiatively active trace
gases other than carbon dioxide. The resulting modified CCM1 is designated
as CCM1-TG (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC3">Model
Designation</A>). </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC5"></A>Model Documentation </H3>

<P>Key documents for the standard CCM1 model are Williamson et al. (1987)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn0">
[1]</A>, Kiehl et al. (1987)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn1">
[2]</A>, and Bath et al. (1987a<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn2">
[3]</A>, b<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn3">
[4]</A>) Wang et al. (1991a<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn4">
[5]</A>, b<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn5">
[6]</A>) describe the treatment of radiative effects of trace gases that
are added to CCM1. </P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC6"></A>Numerical/Computational Properties </H2>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC7"></A>Horizontal Representation </H3>

<P>Spectral (spherical harmonic basis functions) with transformation to
a Gaussian grid for calculation of nonlinear quantities and some physics.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC8"></A>Horizontal Resolution </H3>

<P>Spectral rhomboidal 15 (R15), roughly equivalent to 4.5 x 7.5 degrees
latitude-longitude. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC9"></A>Vertical Domain </H3>

<P>Surface to 9 hPa; for a surface pressure of 1000 hPa, the lowest atmospheric
level is at 991 hPa. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC10"></A>Vertical Representation </H3>

<P>Sigma coordinates, with energy-conserving vertical finite-difference
approximations (cf. Williamson 1983<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn7">
[8]</A>, 1988<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn8">
[9]</A>). </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC11"></A>Vertical Resolution </H3>

<P>There are 12 unevenly spaced sigma levels. For a surface pressure of
1000 hPa, 3 levels are below 800 hPa and 5 levels are above 200 hPa. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC12"></A>Computer/Operating System </H3>

<P>The AMIP simulation was run on a Cray 2 computer using a single processor
in a UNICOS environment. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC13"></A>Computational Performance </H3>

<P>For the AMIP experiment, about 1.2 minutes Cray 2 computer time per
simulated day. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC14"></A>Initialization</H3>

<P>For the AMIP experiment, initial conditions for the atmospheric state,
soil moisture, and snow cover/depth were specified from the NCAR CCM1 model's
standard January initial dataset (cf. Bath et al. 1987a<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn2">
[3]</A>). The model then was &quot;spun up&quot; for 210 days in a perpetual
January mode. The resulting climate state was then taken as the 1 January
1979 starting point for the AMIP simulation. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC15"></A>Time Integration Scheme(s) </H3>

<P>Time integration is by a semi-implicit Hoskins and Simmons (1975)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn26">
[27]</A> scheme with an Asselin (1972)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn6">
[7]</A> frequency filter. The time step is 30 minutes for dynamics and
physics, except for full (at all Gaussian grid points and vertical levels)
radiation calculations which are done once every 12 hours (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC22">Solar
Constant/Cycles</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC16"></A>Smoothing/Filling</H3>

<P>Orography is smoothed (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>).
Negative values of atmospheric specific humidity (which arise because of
numerical truncation errors in the discretized moisture equation) are filled
by horizontal borrowing of moisture in a globally conserving manner. See
also <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC25">Convection</A>.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC17"></A>Sampling Frequency </H3>

<P>For the AMIP simulation, the model history is written once every 12
hours. </P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC18"></A>Dynamical/Physical Properties </H2>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC19"></A>Atmospheric Dynamics </H3>

<P>Primitive-equation dynamics are expressed in terms of vorticity, divergence,
potential temperature, specific humidity, and surface pressure. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC20"></A>Diffusion</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Fourth-order (del^4) horizontal diffusion of vorticity, divergence,
temperature, and specific humidity is computed locally on (approximately)
constant pressure surfaces in grid-point space, except at stratospheric
levels, where second-order (del^2) horizontal diffusion is applied (cf.
Boville 1984<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn9">
[10]</A>). </LI>

<LI>Stability-dependent vertical diffusion is computed locally in grid-point
space at all levels. Cf. Williamson et al. (1987)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn0">
[1]</A> for further details. </LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC21"></A>Gravity-wave Drag </H3>

<P>Gravity-wave drag is not modeled. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC22"></A>Solar Constant/Cycles </H3>

<P>The solar constant is the AMIP-prescribed value of 1365 W/(m^2). A seasonal,
but not a diurnal cycle, in solar forcing is simulated. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC23"></A>Chemistry</H3>

<P>The carbon dioxide concentration is the AMIP-prescribed value of 345
ppm. The vertical distribution of zonal-mean mixing ratios of ozone is
specified from monthly data of D&uuml;tsch (1978)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn10">
[11]</A>, updated by linear interpolation every 12 hours. The radiative
effects of water vapor and oxygen, as well as methane, nitrous oxide, and
chlorofluorocarbon compounds CFC-11 and CFC-12 also are included, but not
those associated with aerosols (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>).
</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC24"></A>Radiation</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Shortwave radiation is treated in two spectral intervals--ultraviolet/visible
(0.0 to 0.9 micron) and near-infrared (0.9 to 4.0 microns). Shortwave absorption
by ozone, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and oxygen is modeled. Direct-beam
absorption by water vapor is after the method of Kratz and Cess (1985)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn11">
[12]</A>; the reflected-beam absorption (as well as Rayleigh scattering
by gases) follows Lacis and Hansen (1974)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn12">
[13]</A>. Oxygen absorption is treated as in Kiehl and Yamanouchi (1985)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn13">
[14]</A>, and near-infrared absorption by carbon dioxide is after Sasamori
et al. (1972)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn14">
[15]</A>. Gaseous absorption within clouds is included. Cloud albedo depends
on optical depth and solar zenith angle, with multiple scattering effects
included. </LI>

<LI>Longwave radiation is calculated in 5 spectral intervals (with wavenumber
boundaries at 0.0, 5.0 x 10^4, 8.0 x 10^4, 1.0x10^5, 1.2 x 10^5, and 2.2
x 10^5 m^-1). Absorption/emission by water vapor (cf. Ramanathan and Downey
1986<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn15">
[16]</A>), carbon dioxide (cf. Kiehl and Briegleb 1991<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn16">
[17]</A>), and ozone (cf. Ramanathan and Dickinson 1979<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn17">
[18]</A>) is treated; the standard CCM1 radiation code is modified to include
absorption/emission by methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbon compounds
CFC-11 and CFC-12 (cf. Wang et al. 1991a<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn4">
[5]</A>, b<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn5">
[6]</A>). The emissivity of nonconvective cloud is a function of diagnostic
liquid water content. For purposes of the radiation calculations, cloud
is treated as randomly overlapped in the vertical. Cf. Kiehl et al. (1987)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn1">
[2]</A> and Wang et al. (1991a<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn4">
[5]</A>, b<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn5">
[6]</A>) for further details. See also <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC26">Cloud
Formation</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC25"></A>Convection</H3>

<P>Moist convective adjustment after the method of Manabe et al. (1965)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn18">
[19]</A> performs several functions: removal of negative atmospheric moisture
values (operating with a scheme for horizontal borrowing of moisture--see
<A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC16">Smoothing/Filling</A>);
dry convective adjustment of unsaturated, unstable layers in the model
stratosphere, with vertical mixing of moisture; and moist static adjustment
of saturated unstable layers and of supersaturated stable layers. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC26"></A>Cloud Formation </H3>

<P>Cloud forms in layers where the relative humidity exceeds 100 percent.
If the vertical lapse rate of the layer also exceeds the moist adiabatic
value, convective cloud forms (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC25">Convection</A>);
otherwise, the cloud is nonconvective, and the fractional cloud cover is
set to 0.95 in the layer. Convective cloud cover depends on the depth of
the vertical instability, with the cloud amount in each layer adjusted
so that the total fractional area is at most 0.30. If there is no associated
precipitation (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC27">Precipitation</A>),
a minimum convective cloud fraction of 0.01 is specified in each layer.
Cloud is not allowed to form in the lowest model layer or in the top 3
layers, but clouds form together in the second and third layers above the
surface if either of these layers is supersaturated. Cf. Kiehl et al. 1987<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn1">
[2]</A> for further details. See also <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>
for treatment of cloud-radiative interactions. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC27"></A>Precipitation</H3>

<P>Precipitation results from application of convective adjustment (see
<A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC25">Convection</A>),
if the vertical column is supersaturated with a lapse rate exceeding moist
adiabatic. Precipitation also results if the column is supersaturated but
with a stable lapse rate. There is no subsequent evaporation of precipitation
before it falls to the surface. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC28"></A>Planetary Boundary Layer </H3>

<P>The height of the PBL top is assumed to be that of the first level above
the surface (sigma = 0.991), except for the calculation of a bulk Richardson
number (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>). In that case, the PBL top is computed from the temperature
at the first sigma level but is constrained to be at least 500 m. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC29"></A>Orography</H3>

<P>After interpolation of 1 x 1-degree Scripps Institution surface height
data (cf. Gates and Nelson 1975<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn19">
[20]</A>) to the model grid, the data are smoothed using a Gaussian filter
with 1.5-degree radius. The resulting heights are transformed into spectral
space and truncated at the R15 model resolution. Cf. Pitcher et al. (1983)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn20">
[21]</A> for further details. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC30"></A>Ocean</H3>

<P>AMIP monthly sea surface temperature fields are prescribed, with daily
values determined by linear interpolation. </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC31"></A>Sea Ice </H3>

<P>Monthly AMIP sea ice extents are prescribed. The ice thickness is assumed
to be a uniform 2 m, and the sub-ice ocean temperature is specified as
a fixed 271.2 K. The surface temperature of the sea ice is computed prognostically
by determining heat conduction from the underlying ocean through the ice,
following the method of Holloway and Manabe (1971)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn21">
[22]</A>. Sea-ice surface temperature is constrained to be always &lt;
0 degrees C (ice melting is not treated), and snow is not allowed to accumulate
on the ice (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC32">Snow
Cover</A>). </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC32"></A>Snow Cover </H3>

<P>Precipitation falls as snow if the temperatures of the surface and the
first two atmospheric levels above it are all &lt; 0 degrees C. Snow cover
is determined from a combination of a monthly latitude-dependent climatology
(cf. Bath et al. 1987a<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn2">
[3]</A>) and prognostic snow accumulation (on land only) that is determined
from a budget equation. A surface temperature &gt; 0 degrees C triggers
snowmelt, which augments soil moisture (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC35">Land
Surface Processes</A>). Snow cover is also depleted by sublimation, which
is calculated as part of the surface evaporative flux (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>). </P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC33"></A>Surface Characteristics </H3>

<UL>
<LI>The surface roughness length is specified as a uniform 0.25 m over
land, sea ice, and snow cover, and as 1.0 x 10^-3 m over ocean. </LI>

<LI>Surface albedos for land surfaces are derived from the Matthews (1983)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn22">
[23]</A> 1 x 1-degree soil/vegetation dataset, but with distinguished vegetation
types reduced to 10 and aggregated to the model resolution (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC8">Horizontal
Resolution</A>). Land albedo also depends on solar zenith angle and spectral
interval (ultraviolet/visible vs near-infrared--see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>).
Snow cover alters the land albedo; the composite value is determined from
equally weighted combinations of the local background albedo and that of
the snow (which depends on surface temperature for the diffuse beam and
on solar zenith angle for the direct beam). Over the ocean, surface albedos
are prescribed to be 0.0244 for the direct-beam (with sun overhead) and
0.06 for the diffuse-beam component of radiation; the direct-beam albedo
varies with solar zenith angle. The albedo of ice is a function of surface
temperature. Cf. Briegleb et al. (1986)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn23">
[24]</A> for further details. </LI>

<LI>Longwave emissivities are set to unity (blackbody emission) for all
surface types. </LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC34"></A>Surface Fluxes </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Surface solar absorption is determined from the albedos, and longwave
emission from the Planck equation with prescribed surface emissivity of
1.0 (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>). </LI>

<LI>Surface fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and moisture are determined
from bulk aerodynamic formulae, following the formulation of Deardorff
(1972)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn24">
[25]</A>. Surface drag/exchange coefficients are a function of roughness
lengths (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>) and bulk Richardson number (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC28">Planetary
Boundary Layer</A>). For computing these fluxes, the surface wind speed
is constrained to be at least 1 m/s. </LI>

<LI>The surface moisture flux also depends on the evapotranspiration efficiency
beta, which is unity over ocean, snow, and sea ice, but which over land
is a function of soil moisture (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC35">Land
Surface Processes</A>).</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC35"></A>Land Surface Processes </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Land surface temperature is determined from the balance of surface
energy fluxes (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>) by the diagnostic method of Holloway and Manabe (1971)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn21">
[22]</A>. (That is, there is no heat diffusion/ storage within the soil.)
</LI>

<LI>Soil moisture is represented by the single-layer &quot;bucket&quot;
model of Budyko (1956)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn25">
[26]</A> and Manabe (1969)<A HREF="../amip/31sunya_fn.html#fn18">
[19]</A>, with field capacity a uniform 0.15 m of water. Soil moisture
is increased by both precipitation and snowmelt. It is decreased by surface
evaporation, which is determined from the product of the evapotranspiration
efficiency beta and the potential evaporation from a surface saturated
at the local surface temperature/pressure (see <A HREF="../amip/31sunya.html#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>). Over land, beta is given by the ratio of local soil moisture
to the field capacity, with runoff occurring implicitly if this ratio exceeds
unity. </LI>
