<A NAME="RTFToC3"></A>Model Designation</H3>
UGAMP UGCM1.3 (T42 L19) 1993
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC4"></A>Model Lineage</H3>
The UGAMP model is based on the ECMWF (cycle 27) model (cf. Tiedtke et
al. 1988<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn0"> [1]</A> and Simmons et al. 1989<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn1">
[2]</A>), but with modifications principally in the treatment of radiation,
convection, surface fluxes, vertical advection, and lateral and vertical
dissipation.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC5"></A>Model Documentation</H3>
Documentation for the ECMWF(cycle 27) predecessor model is provided by
Tiedtke et al. (1988)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn0"> [1]</A> . Subsequent
modifications are described by Slingo et al. (1994)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn2">
[3]</A> and references therein.
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC6"></A>Numerical/Computational Properties</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC7"></A>Horizontal Representation</H3>
Spectral (spherical harmonic basis functions) with transformation to a
Gaussian grid for calculation of nonlinear quantities and some physics.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC8"></A>Horizontal Resolution</H3>
Spectral triangular 42 (T42), roughly equivalent to 2.8 x 2.8 degrees latitude-longitude.
The transform grid is sufficient to prevent aliasing of quadratic quantities,
with 128 equispaced longitudes and 64 Gaussian latitudes. The full radiative
calculations are performed on a reduced longitudinal grid, retaining only
the first 16 Fourier modes (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC9"></A>Vertical Domain</H3>
Surface to 10 hPa; for a surface pressure of 1000 hPa, the lowest atmospheric
level is at about 996 hPa.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC10"></A>Vertical Representation</H3>
Hybrid sigma-pressure coordinates after Simmons and Burridge (1981)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn3">
[4]</A> and Simmons and Str&uuml;fing (1981)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn4">
[5]</A>. To avoid oscillations in the profile of an advected quantity with
rapidly changing gradient, vertical advection is treated by the Total Variation
Diminishing (TVD) scheme of Thuburn (1993)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn5">
[6]</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC11"></A>Vertical Resolution</H3>
There are 19 irregularly spaced hybrid levels. For a surface pressure of
1000 hPa, 5 levels are below 800 hPa and 7 levels are above 200 hPa.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC12"></A>Computer/Operating System</H3>
The AMIP simulation was run on a Cray 2 computer using a single processor
in a UNICOS environment.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC13"></A>Computational Performance</H3>
For the AMIP experiment, about 8 minutes Cray 2 computer time per simulated
day (including data-archiving and storage time).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC14"></A>Initialization</H3>
For the AMIP experiment, the model atmosphere, soil moisture, and snow
cover/depth were initialized from the ECMWF operational analysis for 12Z
on 15 January 1987. These initial conditions were then designated as for
12Z on 15 December 1978, and the model was (partially) "spun up" to the
AMIP start time by integrating it to a simulated state for 00Z on 1 January
1979 with prescribed (and fixed) AMIP sea surface temperatures for January
1979. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC30">Ocean</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC15"></A>Time Integration Scheme(s)</H3>
The time integration is by a semi-implicit Hoskins and Simmons (1975)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn6">
[7]</A> scheme with an Asselin (1972)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn7"> [8]</A>
time filter. Advection of vorticity and moisture by a zonally symmetric
flow is also treated implicitly. The time step is 30 minutes for dynamics
and physics, except for full radiation/cloud calculations once every 3
hours (on a reduced grid, at every fourth point in longitude only--see
<A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>). To ensure mass conservation,
the global mean value of the logarithm of surface pressure is rescaled
at each time step (but with mass sources/sinks associated with evaporation/precipitation
neglected).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC16"></A>Smoothing/Filling</H3>
Orography is smoothed (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>).
Negative values of atmospheric specific humidity (due to numerical truncation
errors in the discretized moisture equation) are filled by borrowing moisture
from successive vertical levels below until all specific humidity values
in the column are nonnegative. Any moisture which must be borrowed from
the surface does not affect the hydrological budget there.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC17"></A>Sampling Frequency</H3>
For the AMIP simulation, the model history is written every 6 hours.
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC18"></A>Dynamical/Physical Properties</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC19"></A>Atmospheric Dynamics</H3>
Primitive-equation dynamics are expressed in terms of vorticity, divergence,
temperature, the logarithm of surface pressure, and specific humidity.
Variations of the gas constant and specific heat capacity with water vapor
content are also included.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC20"></A>Diffusion</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Sixth-order (del^6) hyperdiffusion is applied in spectral space to vorticity,
divergence, temperature, and moisture on the hybrid coordinate surfaces
(see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC10">Vertical Representation</A>). A correction
is also applied to the temperature term to approximate dissipation on constant
pressure surfaces. The diffusion time scale is 4 hours at the horizontal
truncation limit (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC8">Horizontal Resolution</A>),
but this is successively halved on the top four model levels, beginning
at approximately 73 hPa.</LI>

<LI>
Second-order vertical diffusion is applied below a hybrid model coordinate
level of 0.650 to parameterize the PBL (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC28">Planetary
Boundary Layer</A>). In addition, the TVD vertical advection scheme (see
<A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC10">Vertical Representation</A>) includes some
dissipation of kinetic energy where sharp changes in gradient are encountered.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC21"></A>Gravity-wave Drag</H3>
Momentum transports associated with gravity waves are simulated by the
method of Palmer et al. (1986)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn8"> [9]</A>, using
directionally dependent subgrid-scale orographic variances obtained from
the U.S. Navy dataset (cf. Joseph 1980<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn9"> [10]</A>
and see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>). Surface stress due
to gravity waves excited by stably stratified flow over irregular terrain
is calculated from linear theory and dimensional considerations. Gravity-wave
stress is a function of atmospheric density, low-level wind, and the Brunt-Vaisalla
frequency. The vertical structure of the momentum flux induced by gravity
waves is calculated from a local wave Richardson number, which describes
the onset of turbulence due to convective instability and the turbulent
breakdown approaching a critical level. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC22"></A>Solar Constant/Cycles</H3>
The solar constant is the AMIP-prescribed value of 1365 W/(m^2). Both seasonal
and diurnal cycles in solar forcing are simulated. (The correct annual
calendar is used, including Leap Years 1980, 1984, and 1988.)
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC23"></A>Chemistry</H3>
Carbon dioxide concentration is the AMIP-prescribed value of 345 ppm. The
specified ozone profile depends on pressure, total ozone in a column, the
height of maximum concentration, latitude, longitude, and season. Total
ozone is obtained from London et al. (1976)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn10">
[11]</A> data, and the altitude of maximum concentration from Wilcox and
Belmont (1977)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn11"> [12]</A>. Mie radiative parameters
of five types of aerosol are provided for (concentration depending only
on height) from WMO-ICSU (1984)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn12"> [13]</A>
data. Radiative effects of water vapor, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and oxygen are also included (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC24"></A>Radiation</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Atmospheric radiation is simulated after Morcrette (1989<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn13">
[14]</A>, 1990<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn14"> [15]</A>, 1991<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn15">
[16]</A>). Absorption by water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen is accounted for, with shortwave/longwave
absorption coefficients calculated from line parameters of Rothman et al.
(1983)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn16"> [17]</A>.</LI>

<LI>
For clear-sky conditions, shortwave radiation is modeled by a two-stream
formulation in two spectral wavelength intervals (0.25 to 0.68 micron and
0.68 to 4.0 microns), using a photon path distribution method to separate
the contributions of scattering and absorption processes to radiative transfer.
Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering/absorption by five aerosol types
(see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC23">Chemistry</A>) are treated by a delta-Eddington
approximation.</LI>

<LI>
The clear-sky longwave scheme employs a broad-band flux emissivity method
in six spectral intervals between wavenumbers 0 and 2.6 x 10^5 m^-1, with
continuum absorption by water vapor included between wavenumbers 3.5 x
10^4 to 1.25 x 10^5 m^-1. The temperature/pressure dependence of longwave
gaseous absorption follows Morcrette et al. (1986)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn17">
[18]</A>. Aerosol absorption is also modeled by an emissivity formulation.</LI>

<LI>
Shortwave scattering and absorption by cloud droplets are treated by a
delta-Eddington approximation; radiative parameters include optical thickness,
single-scattering albedo linked to cloud liquid water path, and prescribed
asymmetry factor. Cloud types are distinguished by also defining shortwave
optical thickness as a function of effective droplet radius. Clouds are
treated as graybodies in the longwave, with emissivity depending on cloud
liquid water path after Stephens (1978)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn18"> [19]</A>.
Longwave scattering by cloud droplets is neglected, and droplet absorption
is modeled by an emissivity formulation in terms of the cloud liquid water
path. For purposes of the radiation calculations, clouds of different types
are treated as randomly overlapped in the vertical; convective cloud and
the same type of nonconvective cloud in adjacent layers are treated as
fully overlapped.</LI>

<LI>
The full radiation calculations are performed every 3 hours on a reduced
horizontal grid (every fourth point in longitude only), but with effective
transmissivities and emissivities returned on the T42 Gaussian grid (see
<A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC8">Horizontal Resolution</A>). For intermediate
time steps, the effective transmissivities are scaled by the instantaneous
incoming solar radiation to represent correctly the diurnal cycle; the
effective emissivities are scaled by the instantaneous Planck function
to treat temperature variations. However, the influence of clouds remains
fixed between full-radiation steps. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC26">Cloud
Formation</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC25"></A>Convection</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Convection follows the scheme of Betts and Miller (1993)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn19">
[20]</A>, and consists of a relaxed convective adjustment towards calculated
temperature and humidity reference profiles based on observations. The
relaxation times are 2 hours for precipitating deep convection and 4 hours
for nonprecipitating shallow convection, regarded as mutually exclusive
processes. The convection is treated as shallow if the cloud top, defined
by the level of nonbuoyancy, is below about 725 hPa for land or 810 hPa
for ocean (for a surface pressure of 1000 hPa), or if there is insufficient
moisture for precipitation to form with deep convection. Otherwise, the
deep-convection scheme (including the possibility of midlevel convection
with a cloud base above 725 hPa) is operative.</LI>

<LI>
The temperature and humidity reference profiles for deep convection are
based on relevant observational data (cf. Betts 1986<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn20">
[21]</A>). The temperature reference profile is a lapse rate that is slightly
unstable with respect to the wet virtual adiabat below the freezing level,
and that returns at cloud top to the moist adiabat of the cloud base. For
energy conservation, this reference profile is corrected (with a second
iteration) in order to remove the vertically integrated difference between
the total moist enthalpy of the environment and that of the reference profile.
The humidity reference profile is derived from the temperature reference
by linearly interpolating between the humidities for specified values of
subsaturation pressure deficit at cloud base, freezing level, and cloud
top. Below the cloud base, cooling/drying by convective downdrafts is parameterized
by specifying reference profiles for air parcels originating near 850 hPa
that descend at constant subsaturation and equivalent potential temperature.</LI>

<LI>
Nonprecipitating shallow convection is parameterized as a mixing of enthalpy
and moisture of air below cloud base with air at and just above the capping
inversion top. The reference profile is a mixing line structure joining
the conserved saturation pressure and potential temperature points of all
mixtures of the two sources of air (cf. Betts 1983<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn21">
[22]</A>, 1986<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn20"> [21]</A>). Reference temperature
and humidity profiles are computed after specifying a partial degree of
mixing within the cloud, and mixing that is a function of the inversion
strength at cloud top. Cf. Betts and Miller (1993)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn19">
[20]</A> and Slingo et al. (1994)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn2"> [3]</A>
for further details. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC26">Cloud Formation</A>
and <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC27">Precipitation</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC26"></A>Cloud Formation</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Cloud formation is simulated following the diagnostic method of Slingo
(1987)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn22"> [23]</A>. Clouds are of three types:
shallow and deep convective cloud (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC25">Convection</A>);
stratiform cloud associated with fronts/tropical disturbances that forms
in low, middle, or high vertical layers; and low cloud associated with
temperature inversions.</LI>

<LI>
The fraction of shallow convective cloud (typically about 0.30) is related
to the moisture tendencies within the cloud layer (cf. Betts and Miller
1993<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn19"> [20]</A>). The fraction of deep convective
cloud (ranging between 0.20 to 0.80) is determined from the scaled convective
precipitation rate (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC27">Precipitation</A>).
If deep convective cloud forms above 400 hPa and the fractional area is
> 0.4, anvil cirrus and shallow convective cloud also form.</LI>

<LI>
Stratiform cloud is present only when the local relative humidity is >
80 percent, the amount being a quadratic function of this humidity excess.
Low stratiform cloud is absent in regions of grid-scale subsidence, and
the amount of low and middle stratiform cloud is reduced in dry downdrafts
around subgrid-scale convective clouds. Low cloud forms below a temperature
inversion if the relative humidity is > 60 percent, the cloud amount depending
on this humidity excess and the inversion strength. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC24">Radiation</A>
for treatment of cloud-radiative interactions.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC27"></A>Precipitation</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Precipitation is obtained from deep convection as part of the relaxed adjustment
to the reference temperature and humidity profiles (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC25">Convection</A>).
Subsequent evaporation of this precipitation is implicitly treated through
inclusion of effects of convective downdrafts in the lowest three atmospheric
layers. There is additional evaporation below elevated convective cloud
bases that are situated above these downdraft layers.</LI>

<LI>
In the absence of convective adjustment, precipitation also results from
gridscale condensation when the local specific humidity exceeds the saturated
value at the ambient temperature and pressure; the amount of precipitate
depends on the new equilibrium specific humidity resulting from the accompanying
latent heat release. Before falling to the surface, grid-scale precipitation
must saturate all layers below the condensation level by evaporation. Melting
of falling snow (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC32">Snow Cover</A>) occurs
for air temperatures > +2 degrees C.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC28"></A>Planetary Boundary Layer</H3>
Vertical diffusion of momentum, heat, and moisture (proportional, respectively,
to the vertical gradients of the wind, the dry static energy, and the specific
humidity) is operative only below a hybrid-coordinate vertical level of
0.650 (about 650 hPa for a surface pressure of 1000 hPa). The vertically
varying diffusion coefficient depends on stability (bulk Richardson number)
and the vertical shear of the wind, following standard mixing-length theory
(cf. Louis 1979<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn32"> [33]</A> and Louis et al.
1981<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn33"> [34]</A>). See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC20">Diffusion</A>,
<A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics</A>, and <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC29"></A>Orography</H3>
Orography is obtained from a U.S. Navy dataset (cf. Joseph 1980<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn9">
[10]</A>) with resolution of 10 minutes arc on a latitude/longitude grid.
The mean terrain heights are then calculated for a T106 Gaussian grid,
and the square root of the corresponding subgridscale orographic variance
is added. The resulting "envelope orography" (cf. Wallace et al. 1983<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn23">
[24]</A>) is smoothed by applying a Gaussian filter with a 50 km radius
of influence (cf. Brankovic and Van Maanen 1985<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn24">
[25]</A>). This filtered orography is then spectrally fitted and truncated
at the T42 resolution of the model. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC21">Gravity-wave
Drag</A>.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC30"></A>Ocean</H3>
AMIP monthly sea surface temperature fields are prescribed and interpolated
linearly in time at each time step. (These temperatures are uncorrected
for nonzero surface heights associated with the spectral fitting of the
topography--see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC31"></A>Sea Ice</H3>
AMIP monthly sea ice extents are prescribed, but ice surface temperatures
are specified from the Alexander and Mobley (1976)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn25">
[26]</A> dataset. (Points with surface temperatures &lt; -2 degrees C that
are not on land are identified as sea ice; the masking procedure is described
by Brugge 1993<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn26"> [27]</A>.) Snow does not accumulate
on sea ice.
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC32"></A>Snow Cover</H3>
Grid-scale precipitation falls as snow if the temperature of the cloud
layer is below 0 degrees C and that of intervening layers is below +2 degrees
C (thereby inhibiting the melting of falling snow--see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC27">Precipitation</A>).
Snow depth (in meters of equivalent liquid water) is determined prognostically
from a budget equation, but with accumulation only on land. The fractional
area of a grid box covered by snow is given by the ratio of the snow depth
to a critical depth (0.015 m), or is set to unity if the depth exceeds
the critical value. Sublimation of snow is calculated as part of the surface
evaporative flux (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</A>),
and snowmelt (occurring for ground temperatures > 0 degrees C) contributes
to soil moisture (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</A>).
Snow cover also alters the surface albedo (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>).
<H3>
<A NAME="RTFToC33"></A>Surface Characteristics</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The land surface is modeled as bare or with snow cover. Vegetation is not
explicitly specified, but is accounted for in the prescribed surface properties
described below.</LI>

<LI>
Roughness length is prescribed as 1.0 x 10^-3 m over sea ice. Over open
ocean the roughness is computed from the surface wind stress following
Charnock (1955)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn27"> [28]</A>, but it is constrained
to be at least 1.5 x 10^-5 m. The roughness length over land is prescribed
as a blended function of local orographic variance (Tibaldi and Geleyn
1981<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn28"> [29]</A>), vegetation (Baumgartner et
al. 1977<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn29"> [30]</A>), and urbanization (from
the U.S. Navy data set described by Joseph 1980<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn9">
[10]</A>) that is interpolated to the model grid; the logarithm of local
roughness length is also smoothed by the same Gaussian filter used for
orography (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>).</LI>

<LI>
Annual means of satellite-observed surface albedo (range 0.07 to 0.80)
from data of Preuss and Geleyn (1980)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn30"> [31]</A>
and Geleyn and Preuss (1983)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn31"> [32]</A> are
interpolated to the model grid and smoothed by the same Gaussian filter
as used for orography (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC29">Orography</A>).
Snow cover alters this background albedo, with a limiting value of 0.80
for snow depths > 0.01 m equivalent water. Sea ice albedo is prescribed
as 0.55, and ocean albedo as 0.07. All albedos are also functions of solar
zenith angle.</LI>

<LI>
Longwave emissivity is prescribed as 0.996 for all surfaces. See also <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC31">Sea

<LI>
Surface solar absorption is determined from surface albedos, and longwave
emission from the Planck equation with prescribed constant surface emissivity
(see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC33">Surface Characteristics</A>).</LI>

<LI>
Surface turbulent eddy fluxes are simulated as stability-dependent diffusive
processes, following Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Fluxes of momentum/heat/moisture
are calculated from bulk formulae that include the product of a drag/transfer
coefficient, the low-level wind speed, and the vertical difference between
winds/dry static energy/specific humidity at the surface and their values
at the lowest atmospheric level (996 hPa for a surface pressure of 1000
hPa). The low-level wind speed includes an imposed minimum of 3 m/s and
an additional 3 m/s (added quadratically) in the presence of convection.
(The former quantity increases surface fluxes in the limit of low wind
speed, while the latter accounts for subgrid-scale convective circulations--cf.
Slingo et al. 1994<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn2"> [3]</A> .) The surface
drag/exchange coefficients are functions of stability (bulk Richardson
number) and roughness length (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC33">Surface
Characteristics</A>) following the formulation of Louis (1979<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn32">
[33]</A>) and Louis et al. (1981)<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn33"> [34]</A>.
The same transfer coefficient is used for the surface heat and moisture
fluxes.</LI>

<LI>
The surface moisture flux is also equivalent to the potential evaporation
from a saturated surface multiplied by an evapotranspiration efficiency
factor beta (cf. Budyko 1974<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn34"> [35]</A>). The
factor beta is specified as unity over oceans and regions of dew formation
(where the lowest atmospheric level is supersaturated); otherwise, beta
varies with the snow cover and soil moisture content (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC32">Snow
Cover</A> and <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC35">Land Surface Processes</A>).</LI>

Soil temperature and moisture are determined by a model consisting of a
surface layer 0.07 m thick, and middle and deep layers each of thickness
0.42 m. Temperature and moisture are prescribed from monthly climatologies
in the deep layer (cf. Brankovic and Van Maanen 1985<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn24">
[25]</A> and Mintz and Serafini 1981<A HREF="34ugam_fn.html#fn35"> [36]</A>),
but vary prognostically in the surface/middle layers in response to diurnal
and longer-period forcings.</LI>

Soil temperature is determined by simulating heat diffusion with an upper
boundary condition specified by the net balance of surface energy fluxes
(see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC34">Surface Fluxes</A>). Soil heat capacity
and diffusivity are prescribed constants: the density weighted heat capacity
is 2.4 x 10^6 J/(m^3 K) and heat diffusivity is 7.5 x 10^-7 m^2/s).</LI>

Soil moisture also obeys a diffusion equation (with diffusivity one-seventh
that of the heat diffusivity). The upper boundary condition is specified
from the combined rainfall and snowmelt, and from surface evaporation that
is reduced by the presence of (fractional) snow cover. Runoff occurs if
the soil moisture exceeds the layer capacity (scaled according to thickness:
0.02 m for the surface layer and 0.12 m for each of the other layers).
The evapotranspiration efficiency factor beta (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC34">Surface
Fluxes</A>) is a composite of values determined for the snow-covered and
bare-land fractions of a grid box. For snow-covered surfaces (see <A HREF="34ugam.html#RTFToC32">Snow
Cover</A>), beta is unity. Over bare land, beta is the ratio of the surface
layer moisture to a prescribed fraction (0.75) of field capacity, but is
constrained to be at most unity. There is also a temperature-dependent
correction to account for limitation of evaporation due to lack of shortwave
radiation.</LI>
