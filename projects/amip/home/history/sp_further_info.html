<h3><a name="SP1"></a>Subproject 1: Variability in the Tropics: Synoptic to Intraseasonal Timescales</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Julia Slingo, U.K. Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Programme (UGAMP) <br>
Ken Sperber, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The aim of this subproject is to increase our understanding of the possible processes involved in the development, propagation and dissipation of synoptic waves and of the intraseasonal osciallation. This might be achieved by the intercomparison of these phenomena in a large number of models with diverse resolutions and physical parameterizations. A similar study (Park, C.-K., D.M. Straus, and K.-M. Lau, 1990: An evaluation of the structure of tropical intraseasonal oscillations in three general circulation models.
<i>J. Meteor. Soc. Japan</i>,
<b>68</b>, 403-417) of the intraseasonal oscillation in three models suggests that the insight such an intercomparison might provide could be considerable.
<p>Listed below are the primary questions which this subproject aims to address:
<ul>
  <li> How does the intraseasonal oscillation depend on the mean vertical structure such as the static stability, shear
    of zonal wind component, diabatic heating?
  </li>
  <li> Can we identify the characteristics of the convective parameterization, such as the vertical profile of the
    heating, the closure (e.g. moisture convergence), which might influence the existence of synoptic and intraseasonal
    variability? What is the role of the evaporation/wind feedback for both timescales?
  </li>
  <li> Can the behavior of the intraseasonal oscillation be related to the incidence of synoptic variability, and/or
    vice versa?
  </li>
  <li> What seasonal and interannual variability can we identify? How does it compare with reality? Can we learn
    something about the controlling factors (such as those identified in 1 and 2) from such a comparison?
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="SP2"></a>Subproject 2: Intercomparison of Low Frequency Variability</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Francis W. Zwiers, Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCC)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Diagnose and intercompare model bias</li>
  <li> Partition interannual variability according to source (external forcing, internal dynamics, high frequency
    "weather noise")
  </li>
  <li> Diagnose effects of external forcing</li>
  <li> Intercompare interannual variability due to internal dynamics and "weather noise"</li>
  <li> Diagnose potential predictability according to source (external forcing, internal dynamics)</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade>
<h3><a name="SP3"></a>Subproject 3: Cyclone Frequencies and Extratropical Intraseasonal Variability</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Steven Lambert, Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCC)
<p>
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The cyclone frequency climatology and its interannual variability will be extracted from each model and will be compared to observed climatologies. The following aspects will be examined; the total number of cyclone events for the extratropics of both hemispheres, their geographical distribution, the number of cyclone events as a function of central pressure, rates of intensification and rates of dissipation.
<p>The second aspect of the diagnostic activity will examine each model's simulation of high frequency (2-10 day)
  transients, the intraseasonal (24-120 day) variability, and the forcing of the intraseasonal variability by the high
  frequency transients. The possible influence of the SSTs on intraseasonal variability will also be investigated.

<p>&nbsp;Using the results from the above, an attempt will be made to relate deficiencies in the simulated climatologies
  to formulations of the various models.

<h3><a name="SP4"></a>Subproject 4: Clear-sky Greenhouse Sensitivity, Water Vapor Distribution and Cloud Radiative
  Forcing</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
J.P. Duvel and F. Cheruy, Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The purpose is to use simple diagnostics to test the ability of the different models to reproduce the observed relations between the SST, the total precipitable water and the clear-sky outgoing longwave flux. We propose to test first these relations by using geographical distributions of these quantitites over ocean. The sensitivity of the greenhouse effect to the SST changes will be estimated by considering interannual changes.
<p>Such analyses will give insight into the adequacy of parameterization schemes, such as the vertical diffusion and
  convective schemes, for representing the 3-D distribution of the water vapor. By inspecting the relation between the
  total precipitable water and the trapped thermal flux, the proposed diagnostics will also test some aspects of the
  radiative codes in clear-sky condition together with the vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor. The
  interannual sensitivity will test the ability of the different models to correctly redistribute the water vapor when
  the SST changes slightly from year to year.

<h3><a name="SP7"></a>Subproject 7: Intercomparison of Hydrologic Processes in General Circulation Models</h3>

<h3><a name="SP8"></a>Subproject 8: Polar Phenomena and Sea Ice</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
John E. Walsh, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
Because of the importance of the ice/snow-albedo-temperature feedback, it is likely that the validity of the high-latitude amplification of surface temperature predicted by most greenhouse-warming simulations depends considerably on the accuracy with which snow cover and sea ice are simulated in the present climate. While sea ice is prescribed in the AMIP simulations, the high-latitude atmospheric fields that force sea ice dynamically and thermodynamically are likely to vary considerably from model to model. Similarly, the high-latitude fields that will interact with the subpolar ocean in coupled model simulations are likely to differ from model to model in physically important ways. The essence of our AMIP diagnostic subproject is a comparison and assessment of the simulated atmospheric fields that are the major drivers of sea ice and the high-latitude oceans. In the initial phase of the project, we are emphasizing the atmospheric fields that interact with the underlying surface. In a later phase, we will attempt to diagnose some of the model-to-model differences in the polar regions by examining the energy and moisture budgets of the model's high latitudes.

<h3><a name="SP9"></a>Subproject 9: Validation of High Latitude Tropospheric Circulation in the Southern Hemisphere</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Bryant J. McAvaney, Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre, (BMRC)
<h3> Objectives</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> The semi-annual wave in zonal wind and sea level pressure at middle to high latitudes of the Southern
      Hemisphere.

<h3><a name="SP10"></a>Subproject 10: Diagnostics of Atmospheric Blocking in General Circulation Models</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Stefano Tilbaldi and Ennio Tosi, Atmospheric Dynamics Group of Bologna University (ADGB)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
It is proposed that diagnostics of blocking activity in both hemispheres be performed regularly on climate GCM outputs of the AMIP community. The objective of the subproject is to quantify and compare the ability of climate GCMs to represent blocking, which is one of the main sources of mid-latitude low-frequency variability. This should make a valuable contribution toward assessing the potential for applying various GCMs for regional studies, since the LFV generated by atmospheric blocking controls the regional redistribution of precipitation.

  Models</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Alan Robock, University of Maryland<br>
Dian Gaffen, NOAA Air Resources Laboratory <br>
Richard D. Rosen, Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.
<h3> Objectives</h3>
We will validate model output of three important components of the hydrological cycle: soil moisture, atmospheric humidity (including the vertical integral--precipitable water), and horizontal moisture fluxes. We will examine the climatology of the seasonal cycle as well as interannual variability of all these elements using unique observational data sets in our possession. In combination with the results of other diagnostic subproojects, we will contribute to a better understanding of the hydrological cycle of these models.

<h3><a name="SP13"></a>Subproject 13: Diagnoses of Global Cloudiness Variations in General Circulation Model Results and
  Observational Data</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Igor I. Mokhov, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences <br>
Bryan C. Weare, Atmospheric Science Unit, University of California at Davis
<h3> Objectives</h3>
In order to develop more accurate model results of potential anthropogenic influences on climate a much better understanding of the role of clouds and cloud feedbacks in the present climate is required. Presently, there is considerable uncertainty concerning the intraannual and short-term interannual variations of monthly mean cloudiness and their relationship to basic atmospheric variables such as temperature and relative humidity. This proposed analysis will develop special diagnoses of observed cloudiness variability and interactions, evaluate the most important variations, and compare those observations with the general circulation model results.

<h3><a name="SP14"></a>Subproject 14: Cloud Radiative Forcing: Intercomparison and Validation</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Gerald L. Potter, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) <br>
Anthony Slingo, Hadley Centre, U.K. Meteorological Office (UKMO) <br>
Jean-Jacques Morcrette, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The purpose of this subproject is to explore the use of ECMWF reanalysis products to obtain estimates of observed cloud radiative forcing (CRF) during the AMIP period (1979-1988), and to compare the results both with the AMIP models and with ERBE. Initially, simulations of the clear-sky longwave fluxes will be made, but if possible the simulations will be extended to cover shortwave fluxes. The experimental nature of this project will probably ensure that only a part of the calculations will be possible during the ECMWF reanalysis, necessitating the use of SAMPSON (Satellite using Operational Analysis--see Slingo and Webb, 1992 QJRMS) or similar off-line simulation systems.

<h3><a name="SP15"></a>Subproject 15: Atmospheric Angular Momentum in Global Numerical Models</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Raymond Hide, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) is one of the main activities of the WCRP's Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE), in its efforts to refine atmospheric models and improve their ability to produce useful forecasts of changes in weather and climate. As a possible contribution toward the achievement of this goal, the authors of this proposal would promote the thorough investigation of the extent to which the distribution of angular momentum and its exchange (a) between the atmosphere and the underlying planet, and (b) between different parts of the atmosphere, on timescales ranging from days to several years, can be represented correctly by the models being tested. The determination of the extent to which the distribution and exchange of angular momentum is represented correctly in global numerical models of the circulation of the atmosphere is clearly a matter of importance in the formulation of diagnostic schemes for assessing how well the models perform. It is readily shown that large errors in the treatment of energetic processes can be expected in simulations based on models that fail to represent atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) fluctuations satisfactorily.

Franklin Robertson, NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The focus of this investigation is a multi-scale analysis of the moisture and energy cycling over North America using the AMIP GCM simulations, remotely-sensed data sets, and regional atmospheric models. Specifically, this collaborative effort will:
<ul>
  <li> Examine the ability of AMIP GCM simulations to replicate low-frequency and transient linkages between North
    American regional water and energy balance and (i) remote SST forcing, (ii) in situ surface forcing within N.A. and,
    (iii) nonlinear dynamics generated internal to the atmosphere.
  </li>
  <li> Investigate the ability of regional models nested within AMIP GCM boundary conditions to recover small-scale
    moisture transports, cloud structure, and surface energy flux (e.g. nocturnal low-level jet).
  </li>
  <li> Employ regional models in assessing current global model capabilities to effectively represent the ensemble
    effects of subsynoptic moisture and heat transports, surface energy fluxes, cloud and radiative effects, and
    precipitation.

<h3><a name="SP18"></a>Subproject 18: Performance Capability of the Current Atmospheric General Circulation Models to
  Simulate Extreme Events and Associated Circulation Patterns</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Valentin P. Meleshko and A. V. Mesherskaya, Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory (MGO)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The goal of the project is evaluate performance capability of the GCMs in reproduction of extreme events such as intense cold and heat, and prolonged wet and dry spells and associated large-scale anomalies of the atmospheric circulation patterns which can be diagnosed directly from the models.
<p>&nbsp;The study will be based on use of observed and model simulated data sets for the 10-year AMIP period. It is
  intended to identify first observed persistent circulation anomalies with Hovmoeller diagrams constructed for
  particular regions of the northern hemisphere and the whole 10-year period. Similar diagrams will also be made for
  different &amp;quotobserved" indices of extreme events over the same regions and the relationship between the latter
  and circulation patterns (troughs and ridges) will be defined using correlation analysis and distribution statistics
  (occurrence frequency, intensity, etc).

<h3> Leadership</h3>
Hiroshi L. Tanaka, Institute of Geoscience, University of Tsukuba <br>
Akio Kitoh, Meteorological Research Institute of Japan
<h3> Objectives</h3>
The objectives of the proposed project are to evaluate the basic performance of present climate models with respect to the energy transfer and scale interaction in the wavenumber domain. Spectral energetics diagnosis will be performed for all climate model simulations by AMIP modeling groups. The energetics results will be compared with the observed atmosphere analyzed by the major operational analysis centers of the National Meteorological Center (NMC), European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).
<p>First, spectral energy levels of model atmospheres will be compared with observations. The energy spectra will be
  calculated in the zonal wavenumber, meridional wavenumber, and vertical wavenumber domains. The model bias in the
  energy level will be analyzed.

<p>Second, the magnitude and direction of the nonlinear wave-wave interactions will be examined for model atmospheres.
  The nonlinear energy transfer in the climate models will be compared with that of the operational weather forecast
  model.

<p>Third, the variability in both the energy level and its interactions will be compared for the model atmosphere and
  observed atmosphere.

<h3> Leadership</h3>
Sultan Hameed, State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNY) <br>
James Boyle and Benjamin Santer, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
Major modes of climate variability such as the Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the North Pacific Oscillation may be viewed as perturbations in the mean locations and intensities of a few atmospheric centers of action (COA). It follows that our understanding of interannual variability can be improved by diagnosing the simulated COA's in terms of model physical parameterizations. The aims of this proposed research are to investigate the morphology, the genesis and the variability of the major COAs in the tropical and northern Pacific and Atlantic oceans in several AMIP model simulations, to compare the model simulated COAs with observations, and to attempt to relate inter-model differences in the COA features in terms of the differences in model physical parameterizations and boundary conditions.

<h3> Objectives</h3>
<p>The AMIP modeling groups have carried out simulations of world weather for 1979-1988 with prescribed SST. Two groups

<h3><a name="SP25"></a>Subproject 25: General Circulation Model Simulation of the East Asian Climate</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Wei-Chyung Wang, Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York at Albany (SUNYA)
<h3> Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li> To assess the ability of current GCMs to simulate East Asian Climate (EAC), including vacillations between high
    and low zonal index circulations, abrupt seasonal change in the atmospheric circulation and the east Asian monsoon.
  </li>
  <li> To study the mechanisms and factors that caused the intraseasonal to interannual variability in the EAC, which
    include the dynamic and thermal effects of the Tibetan Plateau and anomalous surface boundary conditions (e.g.,
    temperature,snow cover, soil moisture) over the Eurasian continent. Sensitivity experiments will be conducted to

<h3><a name="SP26"></a>Subproject 26: Monsoon Precipitation Simulation in the AMIP Runs</h3>
<h3> Leadership</h3>
Sulochana Gadgil, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Science
<h3> Objectives</h3>
Monthly fields of precipitation and winds of the different models over the tropical belt (and particularly the monsoonal regions) will be intercompared with observations of rainfall (where available) and of satellite-derived measures of convection such as frequency of highly reflective clouds to ascertain the extent to which the following features are realistically simulated:
<ul>
  <li> The spatial variation of the mean seasonal rainfall</li>
  <li> The mean temporal patterns of the large-scale rainfall, duration of the rainy season etc.</li>
  <li> The spatial structure of the interannual variation of the seasonal rainfall and the variation from one month to
    another within the same season
  </li>
</ul>
Models which simulate the decadal mean climatology and/or the intraannual and interannual variability sufficiently realistically for monsoonal regions (particularly South Asia and Africa) will be identified. Further diagnostic studies will be carried out to understand why some models (or versions) are able to simulate the precipitation associated with the continental tropical convergence zone while others are not; i.e. the sensitivity of the simulation of precipitation over monsoonal zones to resolution and physics will be examined.
