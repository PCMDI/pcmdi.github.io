<h1>What is AMIP?</h1>
                          <p><b><font color="#000099">AMIP</font></b> is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). It provides a community-based infrastructure in support of climate model diagnosis, validation, intercomparison, documentation and data access.&nbsp; This framework enables a diverse community of scientists to analyze AGCMs in a systematic fashion, a process which serves to facilitate model improvement.&nbsp; Virtually the entire <a href="../STATUS/incoming.html">international climate modeling community</a> has participated in this project since its inception in 1990.
                          <p><b><font color="#000099">AMIP is endorsed </font></b><font color="#000000">by</font> the <a href="http://www.wmo.ch./web/wcrp/wgne.htm">Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE)</a> of the <a href="http://www.wmo.ch/web/wcrp/wcrp-home.html">World Climate Research Programme</a>, and is managed by the <a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">PCMDI</a> with the guidance of the WGNE AMIP Panel.
                          <p><b><font color="#000099">The AMIP experiment</font></b> itself is simple by design; an AGCM is constrained by realistic sea surface temperature and sea ice from 1979 to near present, with a comprehensive set of fields saved for diagnostic research.
                          <p>This model configuration enables scientists to focus on the atmospheric model without the added complexity of ocean-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system.&nbsp; It is not meant to be used for climate change prediction, an endeavor that requires a coupled atmosphere-ocean model (e.g., see AMIP's sister project <a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip/">CMIP</a>).
