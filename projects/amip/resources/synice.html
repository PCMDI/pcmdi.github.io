<h1>The CCCma Synthetic Sea Ice Thickness
Climatology</h1>
Very few measurments of ice thickness are available. In the Arctic there
are several transects of submarine upward-looking sonar data available
[see e.g. the compilation of Bourke and Garrett (Cold Reg. Sci. Technol.,
13:259-280, 1987)], but in the Antarctic there are only a few drill-hole
observations. These data are insufficient to construct a reliable, global
climatology.
<p>Climate modelers often assign sea ice thickness values of the Arctic
to be 3 m and the Antarctic to be 1 m (or something similar). The CCCma
Synthetic Ice Climatology provides an option to this specification, including
spatial and temporal variation in the ice thickness. It is an estimate
of mean monthly global ice thickness for use in climate model studies in
the absence of an observationally based climatology. Please note: <i>It
is not based on direct observations of sea ice thickness</i>; rather it
is an inference of ice thickness from climatological surface air temperature.
The resulting monthly ice thickness fields have a geographical distribution
which is broadly consistent with the available observations. This synthetic
climatology was used by McFarlane et al. (J. Clim., 5(10): 1013-1044, 1992)
to deduce the required heat flux at the base of the slab ocean in their
GCM.
