<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&nbsp;</b>The El Ni&ntilde;o Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) simulations of 17 global coupled ocean-atmosphere general
circulation models (CGCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP) are analyzed. Monthly mean values of surface air temperature, sea-level
pressure and precipitation for 80 years are analyzed from control runs.
Nearly half of the models studied do not employ any form of flux correction.
Flux-corrected CGCMs were better at simulating the base state and annual
cycle of the temperature field in the equatorial Pacific but not necessarily
better at simulating ENSO variability. While a subset of the models produce
realistic amplitudes of NI&Ntilde;O3 and the Southern Oscillation Index
(SOI), ENSO often tends to occur at a higher than observed frequency. A
few models also capture the teleconnection between NI&Ntilde;O3 temperature
anomalies, SOI, and the global surface air temperature, sea level pressure
and precipitation. Only a few models simulate phase locking of ENSO with
the seasonal cycle. Most models have problems in simulating the ENSO related
sea-level pressure variations over the eastern Pacific and this is associated
with errors in the precipitation response. The models fall into three distinct
categories based on their ability to simulate large-scale ENSO related
patterns of sea-level pressure, surface air temperature and precipitation.
Group 1 consists of models that represent well the Walker circulation anomalies,
the warming and enhanced rainfall in the central/east Pacific. Models in
group 2 exhibit a westward displacement and/or have weak responses, while
group 3 models have the weakest ENSO signatures.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
