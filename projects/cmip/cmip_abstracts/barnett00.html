<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">This paper investigates the uncertainties
in different models estimates of an expected anthropogenic signal in the
near-surface temperature field. We first consider nine coupled global climate
models (CGCMs) forced by CO2 increasing at the rate of 1%/year.&nbsp; At
the end of an 80 year integration, the models produce a signal in the mean
global temperature field that agrees to within about 25%.&nbsp; However,
the spatial patterns of change can be rather different. This is likely
due to different representations of various physical processes in the respective
models, especially those associated with land and sea ice processes. These
inter-model differences will be useful for estimating quantitative bounds
on detection/attribution statements.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We next analyzed 11 different runs from three
different CGCMs, each forced by observed/projected greenhouse gases (GHG)
and direct sulfate aerosol effects.&nbsp; Concentrating on the trend of
near-surface temperature change over the last 50 years, the 'early detection'
period, we found the raw individual model simulations bore little similarity
to each other or to the observations.&nbsp; This was due partially to large
magnitude, small scale spatial noise that characterized all the model runs,
a feature resulting mainly from internal model variability.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Heavy spatial smoothing and differences between different realizations
of an ensemble produced by identical forcing&nbsp; virtually requires that
detection and attribution work be done with ensembles of scenario runs,
for single runs can be misleading.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Recent detection and attribution methods,
coupled with ensemble averaging methods, produced a reasonably consistent
match between model predictions of expected temperature trends due to a
combination of GHG and direct sulfate aerosols and those observed.&nbsp;
The reader should weigh this statement carefully for the runs studied here
did not include other anthropogenic pollutants thought to be important
e.g. indirect sulfate aerosol effects, tropospheric ozone, nor do they
include natural forcing mechanisms (volcanoes, solar variability, etc.)
Clearly, consistency need not imply causality in this case.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our results demonstrate the need to use different
estimates of the anthropogenic fingerprint in detection studies.&nbsp;
Different models give different estimates of these fingerprints and we
do not currently know which is most correct.&nbsp; Further, the intra-model
uncertainty in both the fingerprints and particularly the scenario runs
can be relatively large. In short, simulation, detection and attribution
of an anthropogenic signal is a job requiring multiple inputs from a diverse
set of climate models.</font>
