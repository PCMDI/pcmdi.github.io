<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The common variance between 100-yr-long
control runs from 11 coupled global climate models (CGCMS) has been studied
by use of common empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). The results suggest
that there is a considerable disparity between the CGCMs estimates of internal
variability. About one-half of this difference can be attributed to model
drift or other low-frequency variations in several of the models. However,
even after accounting for this effect, it was found that the models can
easily differ by a factor of 2 or more for the energy levels in different
EOF mode (wave) numbers. Comparison with observations showed that no one
model consistently reproduced the observed partial eigenvalue spectrum.
Again, differences between observed and model energy levels were commonly
a factor of 2 or more. It is speculated that at least some of the disagreement
is due to the relative coarse resolution of the models used in this study.
Separate analysis of a 1000-yr control run of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory model suggested that intramodel variability is much smaller
than intermodel variability. It was also found that an estimate of the
anthropogenic signal due to greenhouse gases and aerosols from the Max
Planck Institute had strong spatial similarities to the leading modes of
the models' common EOFs. This fact complicates the detection attribution
problem.</font></blockquote>
