<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">We forced a global terrestrial carbon cycle
model by climate fields of 14 Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models
(OAGCM) to simulate the response of terrestrial carbon pools and fluxes
to climate change over the next century. These models participated in the
second phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2) where
a 1% per year increase of atmospheric CO2 was prescribed. We obtain a reduction
in net land uptake (NEP) because of climate change, from 1.4 to 5.7 GtC
per year at the time of atmospheric CO2 doubling. Such reduction in terrestrial
carbon sinks is largely dominated by the response of tropical ecosystems,
where soil water stress occurs. The uncertainty in the simulated land carbon
cycle response is the consequence of discrepancies in land temperature
and precipitation changes as simulated by the OAGCM. We use a statistical
approach, based on a factor called interexperiment agreement, to determine
how coherent the responses of land carbon fluxes to differents scenarios
of climate change are. At the continental scale, the interexperiment agreements
of the climate impact on biospheric carbon fluxes and pools changes are
good in the tropics, in the Mediterranean region and in high latitudes
of Northern Hemisphere. These results are the consequence of a good inter-experiment
agreement of soil water content change, which controls the carbon exchange
between land biosphere and atmosphere in the tropics and in the Mediterranean
region and of temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere. The remaining
disagreement between the terrestrial responses to climate change is due
to a combination of differences between the 14 OAGCMs climates and of internal
OAGCM climate variability. We show that disagreement of simulated Net Primary
Production (NPP) and carbon pools changes are mainly driven by intermodel
differences whereas the NEP disagreement is however driven by internal
variability. We then evaluate the carbon uptake uncertainties linked to
assumptions on plant productivity sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 and on
decomposition rate sensitivity to temperature. We show that this uncertainty
is on the same order of magnitude than the uncertainty due to the simulated
climate change. Finally, we find that the OAGCMs having the largest climate
sensitivities to CO2 increase are also those with the largest soil drying
in the tropics, and therefore those with the largest reduction of carbon
uptake.</font>
