      <hr align="left" size="1" width="95%"> <font face="Comic Sans MS">Analysis
of 7 GCM simulations with 2x
CO2 levels shows large and statistically significant free air
temperature changes (compared to controls) along the axis of the
American Cordillera (from Alaska to southern Chile).&nbsp; At all
latitudes, the modeled change in temperature increases with
elevation.&nbsp; Temperature increases are especially large in boreal
summer months from ~35-50&ordm;N, and year-round in the high mountains
of Peru, Bolivia and northern Chile.&nbsp; If these models are correct,
mountain ranges that extend high into the lower troposphere are likely
to experience significant warming, with implications for glacier mass
balance and water resources, montane ecosystems and&nbsp; high
elevation agricultural activities.&nbsp; There are few high elevation
meteorological stations to validate the model projections, or to
monitor future changes.&nbsp; The planned GCOS (Global Climate
Observing System) network is not adequate to address the critical
issues raised by these model simulations; additional high elevation
observing stations are needed.</font><br>
