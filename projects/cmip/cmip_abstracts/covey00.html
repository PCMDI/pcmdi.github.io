<hr align=LEFT size=1 width="95%">
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">We examine the seasonal cycle of near-surface
air temperature simulated by 17 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation
models participating in the Coupled Model</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Intercomparison Project (CMIP).&nbsp; Nine
of the models use ad hoc "flux adjustment" at the ocean surface to bring
model simulations close to observations of the present-day climate.&nbsp;
We group flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted models separately and examine
the behavior of each class.&nbsp; When averaged over all of the flux-adjusted
model simulations, near-surface air temperature falls</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">within 2 degrees K of observed values over
the oceans.&nbsp; The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models
shows errors up to ~6 K in extensive ocean areas.&nbsp; Flux adjustments
are not directly applied over land, and near-surface land temperature errors
are substantial in the average over flux-adjusted models, which systematically
underestimates (by ~5 K) temperature in areas of elevated terrain.&nbsp;
The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models forms a similar
error pattern (with somewhat increased amplitude) over land.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We use the temperature difference between
July and January as a measure of seasonal cycle amplitude.&nbsp; Zonal
means of this quantity from the individual flux-adjusted models form a
fairly</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">tight cluster (all within ~30% of the mean)
centered on the observed values.&nbsp; The non-flux-adjusted models perform
nearly as well at most latitudes.&nbsp; In Southern Ocean mid-latitudes,
however,</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">the non-flux-adjusted models overestimate
the magnitude of January-minus-July temperature differences by ~5 K due
to an overestimate of summer (January) near-surface temperature.&nbsp;
This</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">error is common to five of the eight non-flux-adjusted
models.&nbsp; Also, over Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land areas, zonal
mean differences between July and January temperatures simulated</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">by the non-flux-adjusted models show a greater
spread (positive and negative) about observed values than results from
the flux-adjusted models.&nbsp; Elsewhere, differences between the two
classes</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">of models are less obvious.&nbsp; At no
latitude is the zonal mean difference between averages over the two classes
of models greater than the standard deviation over models.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;The ability of coupled GCMs to simulate
a reasonable seasonal cycle is a necessary condition for confidence in
their prediction of long-term climatic changes (such as global warming),
but it is not a sufficient condition unless the seasonal cycle and long-term
changes involve similar climatic processes.&nbsp; To test this possible
connection, we compare seasonal cycle amplitude with</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">equilibrium warming under doubled atmospheric
carbon dioxide for the models in our data base.&nbsp; A small but positive
correlation exists between these two quantities.&nbsp; This result is predicted
by a</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">simple conceptual model of the climate system,
and it is consistent with other modeling experience, which indicates that
the seasonal cycle depends only weakly on climate sensitivity.</font>
