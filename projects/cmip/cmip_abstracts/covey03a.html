<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP) collects output from global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation
models (coupled GCMs). Among other uses, such models are employed both
to detect anthropogenic effects in the climate record of the past century
and to project future climatic changes due to human production of greenhouse
gases and aerosols. CMIP has archived output from both constant forcing
("control run") and perturbed (1% per year increasing atmospheric carbon
dioxide) simulations. This report summarizes results from 18 CMIP models.
A third of the models refrain from employing ad hoc flux adjustments at
the ocean-atmosphere interface. The new generation of non-flux-adjusted
control runs are nearly as stable as -- and agree with observations nearly
as well as -- the flux-adjusted models. Both flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted
models simulate an overall level of natural internal climate variability
that is within the bounds set by observations. These developments represent
significant progress in the state of the art of climate modeling since
the Second (1995) Scientific Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; see Gates et al. 1996). In the increasing-CO<sub>2</sub>
runs, differences between different models, while substantial, are not
as great as one might expect from earlier assessments that relied on equilibrium
climate sensitivity.</font></blockquote>
