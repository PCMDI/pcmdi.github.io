from atmospheric general circulation models, run with sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) and sea ice amounts set to observed values for the period 1979-1994,
can be compared with "control run" simulations by the same atmosphere models
coupled to interactive ocean and sea ice models. The simulations with prescribed
SSTs and sea ice are available from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project (AMIP), and coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations are available
from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). We compare CMIP
runs from two coupled models sharing a common atmosphere component (but
different ocean components) with the atmosphere component's AMIP run.&nbsp;
All three simulations have similar errors that presumably originate in
the atmosphere component.&nbsp; Replacing the observed SSTs and sea ice
amounts in the AMIP simulation with the interactive sub-models used in
the CMIP simulations tends to degrade the level of agreement with climate
observations.&nbsp; Increases in root-mean-square errors, however, are
mostly less than 30% and often less than 10% of the magnitude of natural
climate variations.&nbsp; Exceptions to this rule occur mainly in the tropics,
most notably for geopotential height at 500 hPa and for temperature near
the tropopause.&nbsp; These variables show increases in RMS error that
are comparable to observational standard deviations.&nbsp; The coupled
model simulations are taken from the end of 300-year control runs without
flux "corrections" at the ocean-atmosphere interface.&nbsp; Their similarity
to results from the prescribed-SST atmosphere model implies that modern
coupled models can maintain stable multi-century simulations without flux
adjustments.</font></div>
