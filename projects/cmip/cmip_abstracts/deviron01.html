<hr align=LEFT size=1 width="95%">
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The anthropogenic increase in greenhouse
gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere will probably induce imporatant
modifications of the global circulation in the atmosphere and ocean. Due
to the angular momentum conservation of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system,
variation of the Earth rotation rate (and the length-of-day (lod) can be
expected. By using the outputs of the models participating in the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 2), we reach the following conclusions:
(1) the different models globally predict an increase of the lod of the
order of 1 microsecond/year, (2) the effect is mostly associated with an
increase of the wind term of the axial atmospheric angular momentum, compensated
about one third by the inverted barometer matter term.</font></blockquote>
