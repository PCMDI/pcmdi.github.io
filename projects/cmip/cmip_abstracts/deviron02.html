<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The anthropogenic increase in greenhouse
gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere will probably induce an elevation
of the temperature, as well as important modifications of the global circulation
in the Earth atmosphere and ocean. Due to the angular momentum conservation
of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system, it can be expected that the Earth
rotation rate, and consequently the length-of-day (lod), will vary. By
using the outputs of the models incorporated in the framework of the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 2), we reach the following conclusions:
(1) the different models globally predict an increase of the lod of the
order of 1 microsecond/year, (2) the effect is mostly associated with an
increase of the wind term of the axial atmospheric angular momentum.</font></blockquote>
