<hr align=LEFT size=1 width="95%">
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">It has been suggested that "flux adjustments"
in climate models suppress simulated temperature variability. If true,
this might invalidate the conclusion that at least some of observed temperature
increases are anthropogenic, since this conclusion is based in part on
estimates of natural temperature variability derived from flux-adjusted
models. We assess variability of surface air temperatures in 17 model simulations
of internal temperature variability submitted to the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project. By comparing variability in flux-adjusted vs. non-flux adjusted
simulations, we find no evidence that flux adjustments suppress temperature
variability in climate models; other, largely unknown, factors are much
more important in determining simulated temperature variability. Therefore
the conclusion that at least some of observed temperature increases are
anthropogenic cannot be questioned on the grounds that it is based in part
on results of flux-adjusted models. Also, reducing or eliminating flux
adjustments would probably do little to improve simulations of temperature
variability.</font>
