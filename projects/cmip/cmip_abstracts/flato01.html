<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Data available from the CMIP contributors
was used to evaluate existing climate models with respect to their ability
to reproduce contemporary sea-ice and snow extent. Figure 8.10 illustrates
the range of sea-ice extent produced by the participating models, comparing
the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile ice margins with the ice edge inferred
from the GISST_2.2 observationally-based data set. The comparison was made
for December-February in the Northern Hemisphere and June-August in the
Southern Hemisphere. The median ice edge (50th percentile) agrees rather
well with observations in the Northern Hemisphere, but underestimates observed
ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere.&nbsp; Intermodel discrepancy (the
range between 10th and 90th percentile contours) was particularly large
in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Figure 8.11 provides a similar
illustration for Northern Hemisphere snow extent. The models' median winter
(December-February) snow line agrees quite well with observations in North
America, but underestimates snow extent in western Eurasia while overestimating
extent in eastern Eurasia.</font>
