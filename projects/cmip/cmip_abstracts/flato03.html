<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:6.0pt;line-height:150%"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The
simulation of sea-ice in global climate models participating in the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP1 and CMIP2) is analyzed. CMIP1 simulations
are of the unpertubed "control" climate whereas in CMIP2, all models have
been forced with the same 1% yr<sup>-1</sup> increase in CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration, starting from a near equilibrium initial condition. These
simulations are not intended as forecasts of climate change, but rather
provide a means of evaluating the response of current climate models to
the same forcing. The difference in modeled response therefore indicates
the range (or uncertainty) in model sensitivity to greenhouse gas and other
climatic perturbations.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:6.0pt;line-height:150%"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The
results illustrate a wide range in the ability of climate models to reproduce
contemporary sea-ice extent and thickness; however, the errors are not
obviously related to the manner in which sea-ice processes are represented
in the models (e.g. the inclusion or neglect of sea-ice motion). The implication
is that errors in the ocean and atmosphere components of the climate model
are at least as important. There is also a large range in the simulated
sea-ice response to CO<sub>2</sub> change, again with no obvious stratification
in terms of model attributes. In contrast to results obtained earlier with
a particular model, the CMIP ensemble yields rather mixed results in terms
of the dependence of high-latitude warming on sea-ice initial conditions.
There is an indication that, in the Arctic, models that produce thick ice
in their control integration exhibit less warming than those with thin
ice. The opposite tendency appears in the Antarctic (albeit with low statistical
significance). There is a tendency for models with more extensive ice coverage
in the Southern Hemisphere to exhibit greater Antarctic warming. Results
for the Arctic indicate the opposite tendency (though with low statistical
significance).</font>
