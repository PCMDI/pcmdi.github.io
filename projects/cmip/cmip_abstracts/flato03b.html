<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Representing the mass balance of sea ice
involves solving a coupled, non-linear set of equations describing ice
motion (momentum balance), thermodynamic growth and melt (energy balance)
and the transport and redistribution of ice thickness (area and volume
conservation).&nbsp; A brief review is provided here.&nbsp; It is the case
that approximations employed to represent many important processes, both
in stand-alone ice models and in more comprehensive global climate models
(e.g. the CMIP coupled OAGCMs), lead to errors or uncertainties in simulated
sea-ice behaviour.&nbsp; Nonetheless, because of the scarcity of direct
observations related to sea-ice mass balance, models provide valuable insights
into the mean state of the ice cover and its historical and projected future
changes.</font>
