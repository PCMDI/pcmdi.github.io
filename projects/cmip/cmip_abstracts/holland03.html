<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The northern hemisphere polar amplification
of climate change is documented in models</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">taking part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project and in the new version of the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Community Climate System Model. In particular,
the magnitude, spatial distribution, and</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">seasonality of the surface warming in the
Arctic is examined and compared among the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">models. The range of simulated polar warming
in the Arctic is from 1.5 to 4.5 times the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">global mean warming. While ice-albedo feedback
is likely to account for much of the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">polar amplification, the strength of the
feedback depends on numerous physical processes</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">and parameterizations which differ considerably
among the models. Nonetheless, the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">mean sea ice state in the control (or present)
climate is found to influence both the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">magnitude and spatial distribution of the
high latitude warming in the models. In</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">particular, the latitude of the maximum
warming is correlated inversely and significantly</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">with sea ice extent in the control climate.
Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">ice cover in the control climate tend to
have higher polar amplification. An</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">intercomparison of model results also shows
that increases in poleward ocean heat</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">transport at high latitudes and increases
in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">to amplified Arctic warming. This suggests
that these changes in the climate state may</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">modify polar amplification. No significant
correlation is found between polar amplification and the control climate
continental ice and snow cover.</font>
