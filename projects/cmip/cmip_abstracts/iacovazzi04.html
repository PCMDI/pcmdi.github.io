<p align="justify"><font size="+1" color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">In this report, simulated global climatologies of seasonal- and annual-average rates of evaporation (<b>E</b>), precipitation (<b>P</b>), and <b>E </b>minus <b>P </b>(<b>EmP</b>)
are presented. These climatologies are computed from coupled model
control run output that have been generated by four participating
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 2+ (CMIP2+) models, and that are
stored on National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)
data archives. For comparison, the simulated climatologies of <b>E </b>over
ocean are accompanied by those computed from the Goddard
Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent Fluxes &#8211; Version 2 (GSSTF-2) data
set. Furthermore, simulated climatologies of <b>E </b>over land are contrasted against those derived from a sum of <b>EmP </b>and <b>P </b>provided,
respectively, by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction -
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) Reanalysis and the
Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The global
climatologies of <b>P </b>inferred from the coupled models are compared with those from GPCP.  Finally, the simulated climatologies of <b>EmP </b>are compared to the difference between <b>E</b> and <b>P</b> computed from the data sets mentioned above. </font></font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+1" color="#000000"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1">We find, in all climatologies, that the globally integrated <b>EmP </b>is very small compared to <b>E </b>or <b>P</b>, which satisfies the physical constraint that <b>E </b>and <b>P </b>must
nearly balance when the water cycle is globally averaged over seasonal
and longer time scales. Also, the following features have been
identified in all water cycle climatologies: the ITCZ and SPCZ; the
monsoons of Asia, Australia, Central Africa, and the Amazon basin; the
Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude storm tracks; the Southern Hemisphere
circumglobal high-latitude storm track; and the major
tropical-subtropical subsidence regions. On the other hand, there can
be discrepancies in the placement, extent, and/or magnitude of these
climatological features amongst the models and the comparison data
sets. This is especially evident in the NCAR and Department of Energy
(DOE) Parallel Climate Model (PCM), which has a double ITCZ about the
equator. </font></font></font></font></p>
