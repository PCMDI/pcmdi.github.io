<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
was set up to examine climate variability and predictability as simulated
by global atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, and to compare the
model results with available observations. This article reports the results
from a subproject that concerns the ocean heat transport and its relationship
to ocean circulation in these coupled models. In particular, the relative
roles of the meridional overturning circulation and horizontal circulation
in determining the ocean heat transport are assessed and contrasted between
the major ocean basins. Many consistent patterns are found among the models
and with observations. A number of discrepancies and uncertainties are
also identified. Some of the discrepancies have already been seen in ocean
only models, and many of the uncertainties are also present in observational
studies. In the Atlantic, the meridional overturning circulation that consists
of the southward transport of the North Atlantic Deep Water and the northward
transport of the upper layer water masses is captured by all the models,
and so is the associated northward heat transport, although quantitatively
there are large differences. In all the models, the North Atlantic Deep
Water is too warm compared with that derived from direct oceanographic
measurements, an indication that high latitude processes responsible for
the production and transport of the North Atlantic Deep Water are not well
represented. In the Pacific, most of the models produced the upper layer
wind-driven circulation. However, none of the models produced a deep circulation
pattern close to that deduced from direct oceanographic measurements, and
consequently the heat transport exhibits large differences between the
models. In the Indian Ocean, all models agree on a southward heat transport
resulting from a meridional circulation of warm southward flow of upper
layer water and cold northward flow of deep water, but disagree on the
magnitude of the heat transport and the strength of the overturning. Observational
studies agree and disagree in a similar way. All the models produced poleward
heat transport by the horizontal circulation in the subtropical regions
of the South Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean basins. In the southern subtropical
Indian Ocean a number of the models produced equatorward heat transport
by the horizontal circulation, contrary to the common belief of a warm
western boundary current. In the North Atlantic, a negligible contribution
from the horizontal circulation is expected but several models produced
significant equatorward heat transport.</font>
