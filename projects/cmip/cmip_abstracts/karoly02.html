<hr align=LEFT size=1 width="95%">
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Several simple indices of surface air temperature
patterns are used to describe global climate variability and change. The
indices include the land-ocean temperature contrast, the interhemispheric
contrast, the meridional gradient, and the magnitude of the seasonal cycle,
as well as the global-mean temperature. These indices retain the main features
of the fingerprints of greenhouse climate change but are easier to interpret.
Also, they are associated with dynamical factors determining the large-scale
atmospheric circulation. For natural climate variations, they contain information
independent of the global-mean temperature.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The behaviour of the indices is investigated
using global observational data for the period 1881-1999, paleoclimate
reconstructions from proxy data for 1700-1990, and long control and anthropogenic
climate change simulations with five different coupled ocean-atmosphere
climate models. Comparison of the variability and correlation structure
of these indices from model simulations with&nbsp; observational data provides
a simple but thorough evaluation of the model simulation of global-scale
surface temperature variability. This is a progress report on a CMIP sub-project.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The variability of all the indices on interannual
and decadal timescales from the control model simulations compares well
with detrended observational data and with the proxy data for 1700-1900.
Hence, the simulation of global-scale surface temperature variability in
these climate models is surprisingly good. The observed trends over the
last 40 years in all the indices are consistent with model simulations
of anthropogenic climate change and are unlikely to have occurred due to
natural climate variations, apart from the interhemispheric contrast. Hence,
these indices provide simple and easy-to-explain evidence of a human impact
on global climate.</font>
