<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">According to estimates obtained using current
coupled climate models, polar regions play a crucial role in projected
global warming. Usually this is explained by positive feedbacks in the
polar climate system, sea ice being a prime consideration. Meanwhile, representation
of high-latitude physical processes and feedbacks is one of weak spots
of current GCMs. In this presentation, the status and tendencies of high-latitude
climate modelling will be considered in the context of global climate natural
variability and anthropogenic change studies. Some results to be presented
were obtained within diagnostic projects of Atmospheric (AMIP II) and Coupled
(CMIP) Model Intercomparison Projects, as well as Arctic Climate Impact
Assessment (ACIA).</font>
