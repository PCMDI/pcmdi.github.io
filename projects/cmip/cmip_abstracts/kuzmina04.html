<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 200%;"><span style="color: black;">The results of 12 coupled climate models participating in
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2) are compared together with
observational data and evaluated in order to investigate the following
questions: 1) How does the current generation of climate models reproduce the
major features of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and 2) How does
NAO intensity and variability change in response to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2
</sub>concentration. Long-term changes in the intensity and spatial position of
the NAO nodes (Icelandic Low and Azores High) are investigated. Different
definitions of the NAO index and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) are analyzed. The
spatial and temporal structure of the NAO in the models is considered. The
observed spatial and temporal variability of the NAO is found to be reproduced
well by the models. The observed temporal trend in the NAO in recent decades
lies beyond the natural variability found in the model control runs. For the
majority of the models, there is a significant increase in the NAO trend in the
forced runs relative to the control runs. These results clearly suggest a
greenhouse-gas forcing effect on the NAO intensity, though the dynamical
mechanisms remain uncertain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
