<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The climates simulated by 15 coupled atmosphere/ocean
climate models participating in the first phase of the Coupled Model lntercomparison
Project (CMIP1) are intercompared and evaluated. Results for global means,
zonal averages, and geographical distributions of basic climate variables
are assembled and compared with observations.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The current generation of climate models
reproduce the major features of the observed distribution of the basic
climate parameters, but there is, nevertheless, a considerable scatter
among model results and between simulated and observed values. This is
particularly true for oceanic variables. Flux adjusted models generally
produce simulated climates which are in better accord with observations
than do non-flux adjusted models; however, some non-flux adjusted model
results are closer to observations than some flux adjusted model results.
Other model differences, such as resolution, do not appear to provide a
clear distinction among model results in this generation of models. Many
of the systematic differences (those differences common to most models),
evident in previous intercomparison studies are exhibited also by the CMIP1
group of models although often with reduced magnitudes. As is characteristic
of intercomparison results, different climate variables are simulated with
different levels of success by different models and no one model is "best"
for all variables. There is some evidence that the "mean model" result,
obtained by averaging over the ensemble of models, provides an overall
best comparison to observations for climatological mean fields.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The model deficiencies identified here do
not suggest immediate remedies and the overall success of the models in
simulating the behavior of the complex non-linear climate system apparently
depends on the slow improvement in the balance of approximations that characterize
a coupled climate model. Of course, the results of this and similar studies
provide only an indication, at a particular time, of the current state
and the moderate but steady evolution and improvement of coupled climate
models.</font>
