<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Five of eighteen climate system models participating
in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are chosen here for
analysis based on their ability to simlulate a reasonable present-day climatology
of the Sahara Desert with similar rainfall distributions and meridional
boundaries as in the observational data. When CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
is increased at one percent per year for 80 years in these models, the
Sahara moves north, becomes hotter, and dries. Compared to the 40-year
control run climatology, the mean average northward shift is around 0.55
degrees of latitude and the surface temperature is about 1.8C warmer at
year 70 when CO<sub>2 </sub>doubles. The local enhanced greenhouse effect
from increased CO<sub>2</sub> increases the net surface sensible heat flux,
which in turn contributes to the warming trend.</font>
