<br><b>&nbsp;</b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The pattern of recent surface
warming observed in the Arctic exhibits both polar amplification</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">and a strong relation with trends in the
Arctic Oscillation mode of atmospheric circulation. Paleoclimate analyses
indicate that Arctic surface temperatures were higher during the 20th century
than during the preceding few centuries and that polar amplification is
a common feature of the past. Paleoclimate evidence for Holocene variations
in the Arctic Oscillation is mixed. Current understanding of physical mechanisms
controlling atmospheric dynamics suggests that anthropogenic influences
could have forced the recent trend in the Arctic Oscillation, but simulations
with global climate models do not agree. In most simulations, the trend
in the Arctic Oscillation is much weaker than observed. In addition, the
simulated warming tends to be largest in autumn over the Arctic Ocean,
whereas observed warming appears to be largest in winter and spring over
the continents.</font></blockquote>
