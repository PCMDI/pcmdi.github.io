<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Increasing concentrations of atmospheric
carbon dioxide will almost certainly lead to changes in global mean climate.
But because--by definition--extreme events are rare, it is significantly
more difficult to quantify the risk of extremes. Ensemble-based probabilistic
predictions, as used in short- and medium-term forecasts of weather and
climate, are more useful than&nbsp; deterministic forecasts using a 'best
guess' scenario to address this sort of problem. Here we present a probabilistic
analysis of 19 global climate model simulations with a generic binary decision
model. We estimate that the probability of total boreal winter precipitation
exceeding two standard deviations above normal will increase by a factor
of five over parts of the UK over the next 100 years.&nbsp; We find similar
increases in probability for the Asian monsoon region in boreal summer,
with implications for flooding in Bangladesh.&nbsp; Further practical applications
of our techniques would be helped by the use of larger ensembles (for a
more complete sampling of model uncertainty) and a wider range of scenarios
at a resolution adequate to analyze average-size river basins.</font></blockquote>
