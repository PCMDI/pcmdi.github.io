<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The goal of this report is to broadcast
rapidly the results of DIVCOP towards the CMIP participants and eventually
to an enlarged community. DIVCOP focuses on the behavior of 17 models over
the equatorial Pacific i.e. mean state, seasonal cycle and interannual
variability. At this stage, only the row results are presented and no full
synthesis is proposed. All contributions to the analysis will be welcome.</font>
