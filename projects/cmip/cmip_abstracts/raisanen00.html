<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The results of 12 coupled atmosphere-ocean
general circulation model experiments participating in the second phase
of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2) are studied with focus
on the area of northern Europe. The variables considered are surface air
temperature, precipitation and sea level pressure. The 80-year control
simulations are first compared with observational estimates of the present
climate. Several aspects of the simulated CO<sub>2</sub>-induced climate
changes, defined by subtracting the control run seasonal or annual means
from 20-year perturbation run means around the transient doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>,
are then studied. The common features and individual variations in the
simulated climate change are documented. Particular attention is put on
expressing the interexperiment agreement in quantitative terms and on estimating
the relative contribution of model-simulated internal variability to the
interexperiment variance. For that purpose, a new statistical framework
is developed. Finally, an attempt is made to statistically relate the interexperiment
differences in the simulated climate change in northern Europe to aspects
of the control climates, global climate change and some of the basic model
characteristics. A summary of the main findings is given in the last section
of the report.</font></blockquote>
