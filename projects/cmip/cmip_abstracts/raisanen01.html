<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font point-size="12">&nbsp;</font>CO<sub>2</sub>-induced
changes in surface air temperature, precipitation and sea level pressure
are compared between model experiments participating in the second phase
of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2). A statistical formalism
is applied, in which the average squared amplitude of the simulated climate
changes is divided into a common signal and variances associated with internal
variability and model differences.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 20-year period centred
at the doubling of CO<sub>2 </sub>and for a set of 14-15 models, the dimensionless
global relative agreement on grid box scale annual mean climate changes
is 0.89 for surface air temperature but only 0.22 for precipitation and
0.46 for sea level pressure. A majority of the interexperiment differences
are attributed to model differences; the contribution of internal variability
to the differences in change is estimated as 16% for temperature, 34% for
precipitation and 32% for sea level pressure. For seasonal rather than
annual climate changes, the agreement is lower and the contribution of
internal variability to the interexperiment variance larger. Likewise,
the relative agreement is worse and internal variability in relative terms
more important earlier during the transient experiments than around the
doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. Conversely, when climate changes are averaged
over larger areas than individual grid boxes, the relative agreement improves
with increasing averaging domain (especially with precipitation and temperature)
and the impact of internal variability decreases.</font></blockquote>
