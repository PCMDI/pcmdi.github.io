<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Because of inherent uncertainties
in the computational reppresentation of climate and because of unforced
chaotic climate variability, it is argued that climate change projections
should be expressed in probabilistic form. In this paper, 17 Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project second phase experiments sharing the same gradual
increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are treated as a probabilistic multi-model
ensemble projection of future climate. Tools commonly used for evaluation
of probabilistic weather and seasonal forecasts are applied to this climate
change ensemble. The probabilities of some temperature- and precipitation-related
events defined for 20-year seasonal means of climate are first studied.
A cross-verification exercise is then used to obtain an upper estimate
of the quality of these probability forecasts in terms of Brier skill scores,
reliability diagrams, and potential economic value. Skill and value estimates
are consistently higher for temperature-related (e.g., will the 20-year
period around the doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> be at least 1&ordm;C warmer
than the present?) than for precipitation-related events (e.g., will the
mean precipitation decrease by 10% or more?). For large enough CO<sub>2</sub>
forcing, however, probabilistic projections of precipitation-related events
also exhibit substantial potential economic value for a range of cost-loss
ratios. The treatment of climate change information in a probabilistic
rather than deterministic manner (e.g., using the ensemble consensus forecast)
can greatly enhance its potential value.</font></blockquote>
