<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in the interannual
variability of monthly surface air temperature and precipitation are studied
using 19 model experiments participating in the second phase of the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2). The magnitude of variability in
the control runs appears generally reasonable, but it varies a great deal
between different models, and almost all models overestimate temperature
variability on low-latitude land areas. In most models the gradual doubling
of CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a decrease in temperature variability in the
winter half-year in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere and over the
high-latitude Southern Ocean. Over land in low latitudes and in northern
midlatitudes in summer, a slight tendency toward increased temperature
variability occurs. The standard deviation of monthly precipitation increases,
on the average, where the mean precipitation increases, but also does so
in some areas where the mean precipitation decreases slightly. The coefficient
of variation of precipitation (i.e. the ratio between the standard deviation
and the mean) also tends to increase in most areas, especially where the
mean precipitation decreases. However, the changes in variability are less
similar among the 19 experiments than the changes in mean temperature and
precipitation, at least partly because they have a much lower signal-to-noise
ratio. In addition, the changes in the standard deviation of monthly temperature
are generally much smaller than the time mean warming, which suggests that
future changes in the extremes of interannual temperature variability will
be largely determined by the latter.</font>
