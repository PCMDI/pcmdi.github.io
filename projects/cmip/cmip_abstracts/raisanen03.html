<div wrap=""><font face="Comic Sans MS">The decade 1991-2000 was warm and
wet in Sweden, with 10-station mean temperature 0.8&deg;C above and 20-station
mean precipitation 6% above the mean for 1961-1990. Here we study the question
whether such changes should be seen as a symptom of anthropogenic climate
change or if they might be of purely natural origin. Using the control
simulations of 19 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and taking
into account differences between the simulated and observed interannual
variability, we estimate that the recent increase in temperature and that
in precipitation both had about a 6-7% chance to occur solely as a result
of natural variability. Using the corresponding simulations with increasing
CO<sub>2</sub>, we further estimate that the anthropogenic forcing raised
the probability of occurrence of the observed changes to 23% for the increase
in temperature and to 14% for the increase in precipitation. About half
of the warming and about 30% of the increase in precipitation appear to
be explained by anthropogenic forcing. The seasonal aspects of observed
and simulated climate change are also discussed, with special emphasis
on winter when the observed warming has been much larger than expected
from the model simulations. Finally, a probabilistic forecast for the Swedish
climate in the first decade of the 21st century suggests a 95% (87%) possibility
of warmer (wetter) annual mean conditions than in 1961-1990 on the average.
One of the caveats in our analysis is that the model simulations exclude
variations in solar and volcanic activity, the effects of which might not
be fully covered by our rescaling of interannual variability.</font></div>
