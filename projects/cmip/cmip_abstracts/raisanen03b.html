<div wrap=""><font face="Comic Sans MS">The response of atmospheric angular
momentum to a gradual doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> is studied using 16 model
experiments participating in the second phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project. The relative angular momentum associated with atmospheric zonal
winds increases in all but one of the models, although the magnitude of
the change varies widely. About 90% of the 16-model mean increase comes
from increasing westerly winds in the stratosphere and the uppermost low-latitude
troposphere above 200 hPa. This increase in westerly winds reflects a steepening
of the meridional temperature gradient near the tropopause and in the upper
troposphere. The simulated temperature gradient at this height increases
partly as an indirect consequence of the poleward decrease in the tropopause
height, and partly because convection induces a maximum in warming in the
tropical upper troposphere. The change in the omega angular momentum associated
with the surface pressure distribution is in most models smaller than the
change in the relative angular momentum, although its exact value is sensitive
to the method of calculation.</font></div>
