<hr align=LEFT size=1 width="95%">
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The role of climate sensitivity and ocean
heat uptake in determining the range of climate model response is investigated
in the CMIP2 AOGCM results. The fraction of equilibrium warming that is
realised at any one time is less in those models with higher climate sensitivity,
leading to a reduction in the temperature response range at the time of
CO2 doubling (TCR range - transient climate response). The range is reduced
by a further 15% due to an apparent relationship between climate sensitivity
and the efficiency of ocean heat uptake. We suggest some possible physical
causes for this relationship.</font>
