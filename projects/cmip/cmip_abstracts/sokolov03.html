<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The transient response of both surface air
temperature and deep ocean temperature to an increasing external forcing
strongly depends on climate sensitivity and the rate of the heat mixing
into the deep ocean, estimates for both of which have large uncertainty.
In this paper we describe a method for estimating rates of oceanic heat
uptake for coupled atmosphere/ocean general circulation models from results
of transient climate change simulations. For models considered in this
study, the estimates vary more than threefold. Nevertheless, values for
all models fall in the 5-95% interval of the range implied by the climate
record for the last century. The MIT 2D climate model, with an appropriate
choice of parameters, matches changes in surface air temperature and sea
level rise simulated by different models. It also reproduces the overall
range of changes in precipitation.</font>
