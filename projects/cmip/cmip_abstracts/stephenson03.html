<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">This study investigates the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) simulated by 17 global coupled ocean-atmosphere&nbsp;
models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).
Robust NAO indices are defined by calculating the leading performing principal
components of wintertime mean surface temperatures (land and sea) in the
North Atlantic region (120W-60E, 20-80N). Encouragingly, 13 out of 17 of
the models capture the NAO surface temperature quadrupole pattern with
centres of action over Northwest Europe, the northwest Atlantic, the southeastern
USA, and the Middle East. The northern dipole is better captured than the
southern dipole which is often simulated too far eastwards over the Atlantic
Ocean.&nbsp; Out of the 17 models, 10 models produce NAO indices that vary
similar to the observations as stationary "weakly red nosie" with only
small correlations between successive winters (r &lt; 0.3).&nbsp; Another
five models drift monotonically towards warmer conditions, and two models
exhibit long-term stochastic trends. Several of the models significantly
overestimate the teleconnection between NAO and the tropical ENSO phenomenon.</font></blockquote>
