<hr align=LEFT size=1 width="95%">
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is shown that lagged correlations for
and cross-correlations between observed hemispheric-mean temperature data
differ markedly from those for unforced (control-run) climate model simulations.
The differences can be explained adequately by assuming that the observed
data contain a significant externally forced component involving both natural
(solar) and anthropogenic influences and that the global climate sensitivity
is in the commonly accepted range. Solar forcing alone cannot reconcile
the differences in autocorrelation structure between observations and model
control-run data.</font>
