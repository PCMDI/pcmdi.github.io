These data are for use in research projects only.  A 'research project' is any project carried
out by an individual or organized by a university, a scientific institute, or similar organization
(private or public) for non-commercial research purposes only.  Results based on these data must
be submitted for publication in the open literature without any delay linked to commercial objectives.
</p>
<p>An additional restriction is that the UK Met. Office / Hadley Centre requires strict adherence
to the conditions set forth in their "License Statement", which applies to their model output:
</p>
<p> "These data are licensed for use in Research Projects only. A 'Research Project' is any project
organised by a university, a scientific institute, or similar organisation (private or public),

non-commercial purposes is that all the results obtained are openly available at delivery costs
only, without any delay linked to commercial objectives, and that the research itself is submitted
for open publication.

<b><a name="Proper_acknowledgement">Proper citation and acknowledgement</a></b></p>
<p>In first making reference to the data obtained from the CMIP3 archive, please
include the phrase "the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset".&nbsp; Subsequent
references within the same publication might refer to the data with terms such
as "CMIP3 data", "the CMIP3 multi-model dataset", "the CMIP3 archive", or the
"CMIP3 dataset".</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whenever you publish research based on model output from the CMIP3
database, you should include the following acknowledgement:</p>
<p>"<i>We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for their
roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset.&nbsp;  Support of this dataset is
provided by the Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy.</i>" </p>
<p> [Note that the acronyms, WCRP and CMIP3, should have already appeared in the main text of your article,
where they were presumably defined.  You may also have already defined "PCMDI" and "WGCM",
which would allow you to simply refer to them here using the acronyms.]</p>
<p> You may also find it useful to reference the following article, which provides an
overview and documentation of the CMIP3 modelling activity: </p>

<p>
In some cases data contributed to the database have been found to contain errors
of various sorts. Certain files are then withdrawn or replaced and an entry is
logged on the errata page:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/errata.do">
https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/errata.do</a> <br>
&nbsp;The errata page should be checked frequently to avoid analyzing "garbage",
and to determine whether any of the files you have downloaded from the PCMDI
site need to be updated or removed. If any of you find undetected errors in the
data you are analyzing, please contact the responsible modeling group and copy
<a href="mailto:taylor13@llnl.gov">taylor13@llnl.gov</a>. </p>
<p>
One general warning concerning the global attributes in each file -- the "title"
and "comment" attributes may in some cases incorrectly identify the experiment,
whereas the "experiment_id" will always be correct.&nbsp; If there is a
conflict, rely only on experiment_id.</p>
