WGCM invitation to participate</a></b> in CMIP3 in preparation for the IPCC AR4</p>

<p>
Some of the IPCC WG1 lead authors (notably from Chapter 8  model evaluation)
have requested specific information that might prove useful in preparing their
chapters. The overall purpose of Chapter 8 of the AR4 is to assess the ability
of the global climate models to make projections of future climate change. Many
of the analyses you are performing will contribute to answering this question.
In the Third Assessment Report, Table 8.2 included several ocean circulation
diagnostics for each of the models, along with an observational estimate of
these same quantities (e.g., Antarctic circumpolar current transport strength,
Nino 3 SST standard deviation, etc.). For the AR4, plans include considerably
expanding a table of this sort, providing characteristics of the mean climate
state and additional metrics for quantifying the ability of models to simulate
particular phenomena. The chapter 8 authors would like to rely on you to provide
scalar measures of model performance for each model and, when practical, for the
multi-model mean simulation. These measures might, as appropriate, be in the
form of an RMS error, a correlation, a mean difference, a ratio of variances, or
(as in the TAR Table 8.2) simply a scalar measure of some simulated and observed
quantity. As one part of your analysis, therefore, it would be useful to
synthesize your results into a single (or perhaps a couple of) scalar metrics
that can be used to gauge how well each individual model simulates the aspect of
climate that you are analyzing. This request should certainly not be considered
a requirement, but if you can produce a scalar metric of this sort, the chapter
8 authors will be grateful. </p>
<p>
A final note concerning metrics: For some quantities, observational uncertainty
will be an issue. Whenever possible, therefore, an assessment should be made as
to how this uncertainty might affect the apparent agreement or disagreement
between models and observations. When more than one reliable observational data
set is available, it would be helpful to calculate differences based also on the
alternative. </p>
<p>

"mean climate"</a></b></p>
<p>
The IPCC WG1 lead authors have also made the following suggestion meant to help
unify the analysis of model results. In defining the 'mean climate state' of a
model for comparison against observations there are number of choices that could
be made, e.g. use model 'control runs' (which may have either preindustrial or
present day trace gases), or use the '20th Century all forcings' runs (many of
which are available as ensembles started from varying initial conditions). For
the 20th Century integrations there is also a choice of meaning period. It is
recognized that the optimal choice for a given problem may depend on a number of
factors including the period over which observations are available, and the need
for a non-drifting or non-trending model solution. We also recognize that some
projects have already begun their analyses based on a particular choice. We
therefore do not wish to prescribe a solution to this problem and leave it to
the judgment of individual projects. However, in cases where there is a choice,
we wish to encourage as much uniformity in the analysis as possible, and
therefore propose that other things being equal, model mean climate is defined
based on the 1981-2000 period of the 'all forcings 20th Century' runs (or the
ensemble mean where appropriate). </p>

<a name="IPCC_timeline">IPCC
deadlines and transfer of information to WG1 Lead Authors</a></b></p>
<p>
To fit with the IPCC review process, papers will need to be submitted to
peer-reviewed journals and available to IPCC lead authors by 1 MAY 2005
<a href="../../ipcc/revised_deadlines.php">(REVISED TO 31 MAY 2005)</a>, and
accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal by approximately 1 DEC 2005
<a href="../../ipcc/revised_deadlines.php">(REVISED TO 15 DECEMBER 2005)</a>.
These deadlines are set to allow lead authors time to consider all available
literature in time for the first and second AR4 drafts. Electronic copies of
papers need to be sent to the appropriate lead author contacts, with an
electronic copy lodged with the WG1 Technical Support Unit (TSU)  see below. </p>
<p>
For the May deadline, the authors need some form of draft paper to assess. In
almost all cases this will be in the form of a paper submitted to a
peer-reviewed journal. An exception to the need for a peer-reviewed paper can be
made for calculations of well-established diagnostics (e.g. where the diagnostic
and the lines of inference from the results are described in a number of
existing peer-reviewed papers). This would be at the discretion of the lead
authors and would be subject to scrutiny by the WG1 Review Editors and Bureau.
If you are planning work of this type I would advise establishing early direct
contact with an appropriate lead author. </p>
<p>
<i>List of contacts for AR4 modelling chapters</i> </p>
<p>
Please email a pdf copy of your paper to the IPCC WG1 TSU&nbsp; (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ipcc-wg1@al.noaa.gov">ipcc-wg1@al.noaa.gov</a>)
and to the&nbsp; relevant contact points below. Note that your study may be relevant
to more than one chapter (e.g. a study that considers both the control
simulations of ENSO and future changes in ENSO would be relevant to both
Chapters 8 and 10). </p>
<p>
Roughly speaking, Ch. 8 deals with simulations of aspects of the climatology or
processes in present-day climate, Ch. 9 addresses simulation of trends or
responses to specific forcings in 20th century climate in addition to
detection/attribution studies, Ch. 10 assesses any aspect of climate change
projections from global models, and Ch. 11 deals with aspects of regional
climate change projections from regional models or information downscaled from
global models.&nbsp; These are not strict boundaries, but are used for general
guidance to give you a rough idea of where to send copies of your papers.&nbsp; As
long as you send copies to the chapter contacts you think are relevant for your
paper, it is then the responsibility of the respective lead authors to sort out
exactly where your results will be assessed. </p>
