# CMIP5 - Data Access - Data Portal



## CMIP5

08/29/2012:      The new ESGF peer-to-peer (P2P) enterprise system (http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov) is now the official site for CMIP5 model output. The old gateway (http://pcmdi3.llnl.gov) is deprecated and now shut down permanently. Please send e-mail to esgf-user@lists.llnl.gov to report bugs and provide feedback.

The CMIP5 Data is now available through the new portal, the Earth System Grid - Center for Enabling Technologies (ESG-CET), on the page <http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/> . 

You may search or browse through the Earth System Grid data holdings, but you will need to [create an account](https://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/createAccount) to download the data.

It is highly recommended that you read the 'Getting started' page first.
