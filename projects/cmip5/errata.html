<center><h2>CMIP5 Data Issues</h2></center>

<p>This "online errata sheet" is an interim website summarizing known problems in the CMIP5 database
   of climate model output. We plan to eventually replace it with a wiki-like website allowing users
   and data providers to enter updates. Meanwhile, please email Curt Covey
   (<a href="mailto:covey1@llnl.gov">covey1@llnl.gov</a>) to contribute updates and additional problem
   notifications. </p>

          global mean cloudiness value of only 44.87%. This discrepancy is too large to be explained by differences<br>
          between model and satellite definitions of cloudiness. The source of the discrepancy is probably an<br>

    <td>Per Balwinder Singh, PNNL: There was an error in data submitted to CMIP5 in the top of atmosphere fluxes for many of the variants of CCSM and CESM model simulations (CESM1-CAM5-1-FV2, CESM1-CAM5 and CCSM4) that can lead to the conclusion that the model does not conserve energy. The model does in fact conserve energy precisely -- the error arises because we produced an inconsistent characterization of top of atmosphere energy fluxes based upon a mixture of "top of model" and "top of atmosphere" fluxes in our early submissions to CMIP5.   The field is being corrected for all runs, to eliminate the problem, but we are aware that some users have downloaded the data and corrupt versions are floating around of this field. If you care about the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) energy budget it is important to get the corrected datasets.
You can tell whether you have a corrupted dataset by examining metadata for the "rlut" field. If the field contains the following metadata:
<br><br>
"rlut:comment = "FSNTOA-FSNT+FLNT, CMIP5_table_comment: at the top of The atmosphere (to be compared with satellite measurements)"
<br><br>
it is correct. Otherwise "rlut" is corrupt and you should download a new copy of that data.
