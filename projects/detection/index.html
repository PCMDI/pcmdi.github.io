<h3> Synthetic Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) temperatures </h3>

<h4> 1. New Synthetic MSU Data (2011)</h4>

 <p>We now employ a new method to calculate synthetic Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) atmospheric temperatures from climate model simulation output. This method was developed by Dr. Carl Mears at Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) in Santa Rosa, California. The method relies on local weighting functions, whose values are dependent on the surface pressure and surface type at each model grid-point. The method is fully described in:</p><br><br><br>

<p>This new method has been applied to simulation output from phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-3). The synthetic MSU lower tropospheric temperatures calculated from CMIP-3 output are analyzed in:</p><br><br><br>
