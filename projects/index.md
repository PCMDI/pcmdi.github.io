# Model Intercomparison

#### [AMIP - Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project][AMIP]
AMIP is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs).

#### [CMIP - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project][CMIP]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) studies output from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models that also include interactive sea ice.  These models allow the simulated climatls e to adjust to changes in climate forcing, such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.  CMIP began in 1995 by collecting output from model "control runs" in which climate forcing is held constant.  Later versions of CMIP have collected output from an idealized scenario of global warming, with atmospheric CO2 increasing at the rate of 1% per year until it doubles at about Year 70.  CMIP output is available for study by approved diagnostic sub-projects.  The WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset archived at PCMDI, included realistic scenarios for both past and present climate forcing.  The research based on this dataset has provided much of the new material underlying the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). The ongoing [WCRP CMIP5][CMIP5] experiment will be the bases for the upcoming IPCC AR5 scheduled for 2013.

# Detection and Attribution
[Detection and Attribution Research][DETC]
PCMDI has led research into the detection and attribution of the causes of climate-change. This work has considered a wide-range of changes to the global climate system and included analyses of atmospheric temperature, precipitable water, ocean heat content and other key aspects of the climate system

# Climate Model Metrics


[Diagnosis of Climate Model Performance][DCMP]
The PCMDI metrics package is used to objectively compare results from climate models with observations using well-established statistical tests. Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP5 and earlier CMIP phases

# Observations for MIPs


[obs4MIPs][OCME]
obs4MIPs (Observations for Model Intercomparisons Project) is an activity to make observational products more accessible for climate model intercomparisons

----
# Input for MIPs

[input4MIPs][ICME]
input4MIPS (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects) is an activity to make available via ESGF the boundary condition and forcing datasets needed for CMIP6. Various datasets are needed for the pre-industrial control (piControl), AMIP, and historical,  simulations, and additional datasets are needed for many of the <a href="http://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-cmip6-endorsed-mips" target="_blank>CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) experiments</a>. Earlier versions of many of these datasets were used in the <a href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5" target="_blank">5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)</a>
