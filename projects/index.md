# Model Intercomparison

#### [AMIP - Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project][AMIP]
AMIP is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs).

#### [CMIP - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project][CMIP]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) studies output from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models that also include interactive sea ice.

#### [CMIP2]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase II

#### [CMIP3][CMIP3]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase III

#### [CMIP5][CMIP5]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase V

#### [CMIP6][CMIP6]
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase VI

# Detection and Attribution

#### [Detection and Attribution Research][DETC]
PCMDI has led research into the detection and attribution of the causes of climate-change. This work has considered a wide-range of changes to the global climate system and included analyses of atmospheric temperature, precipitable water, ocean heat content and other key aspects of the climate system

# Climate Model Diagnosis

#### [Diagnosis of Climate Models][CMD]
PCMDIâ€™s mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and evaluation of climate models. Although models have become increasingly complex, model errors and disagreements among model simulations remain substantial and poorly understood. The nature and causes of these disagreements should be uncovered before the models are fully trusted to inform us about global climate change.

# Climate Model Metrics

#### [Diagnosis of Climate Model Performance][DCMP]
The PCMDI metrics package is used to objectively compare results from climate models with observations using well-established statistical tests. Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP5 and earlier CMIP phases

# Observations for MIPs

#### [obs4MIPs][OCME]
obs4MIPs (Observations for Model Intercomparisons Project) is an activity to make observational products more accessible for climate model intercomparisons

---

# Input for MIPs

#### [input4MIPs][ICME]
input4MIPS (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects) is an activity to make available via ESGF the boundary condition and forcing datasets needed for CMIP6. Various datasets are needed for the pre-industrial control (piControl), AMIP, and historical,  simulations, and additional datasets are needed for many of the <a href="http://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-cmip6-endorsed-mips" target="_blank">CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) experiments</a>. Earlier versions of many of these datasets were used in the <a href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5" target="_blank">5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)</a>
