Model COLA 2: Elaborations</h1>
<h3>
<hr width="100%"></h3>
<h3>
<a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model COLA2 is an entry in the CMIP1 intercomparison only.
<h3><br>
<a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization of the COLA coupled model was a
follows (reference: E. Schneider, personal communication):
<ul>
  <li>The model atmosphere was integrated to equilibrium using as a
boundary
conditions either prescribed SSTs or the forcing provided by coupling
to
a mixed-layer ocean model.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The model ocean was initialized, whole-volume, to the
observations
(e.g., <a href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus
1982</a> data).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The models then were coupled and integrated without flux
adjustments
for
190 years.&nbsp; The first 80 years of the run were discarded, and
time-mean
variables were computed from the last 100 years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Land surface processes are simulated following the <a
 href="#Xue%20et%20al.%201991">Xue
et al. (1991)</a> modification of the SiB model of <a
 href="#Sellers%20et%20al.%201986">Sellers
et al. (1986)</a>. Within the single-story vegetation canopy,
evapotranspiration
from dry leaves includes detailed modeling of stomatal and canopy
resistances;
direct evaporation from the wet canopy and from bare soil is also
treated.
Precipitation interception by the canopy is simulated, and its
infiltration
into the ground is limited to less than the hydraulic conductivity of
the
soil.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Soil temperature is determined in two layers by the force-restore
method
of <a href="#Deardorff%201978">Deardorff (1978)</a>. Soil moisture,
which
is predicted from diffusion equations in three layers, is increased by
infiltrated precipitation and snowmelt, and is depleted by
evapotranspiration,
direct evaporation, and drainage. Both surface runoff and deep runoff
from
gravitational drainage are simulated, but the contribution of runoff to
the freshwater flux into the ocean model is not included.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The sea ice parameterization (cf. the appendix to <a
 href="#Schneider%20and%20Zhu%201998">Schneider
and Zhu 1998</a>) is a simple prognostic single-layer thermodynamic
model.
Given surface fluxes provided by the atmospheric model, the scheme
calculates
changes in ice thickness and surface temperature, and the modified
fluxes
of heat and fresh water supplied to the underlying ocean. The time step
is semi-analytic to maintain stability.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice forms over the whole of an ocean grid box when the
temperature
of the topmost ocean layer is predicted to fall below the saltwater
freezing
temperature.&nbsp; Melting occurs at&nbsp; the top or bottom of the ice
if the respective temperatures of these surfaces are predicted to be
above
this freezing point.&nbsp; Freshwater fluxes from the atmosphere are
unmodified
by the sea ice, but freezing or melting at the ice bottom causes
appropriate
changes in the freshwater flux to the ocean.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ice albedo is a constant, independent of surface temperature
or ice
melt.&nbsp; Solar radiation does not penetrate the ice and there are no
other internal heat sources. Overlying snow cover also does not affect
the ice thermodynamics.&nbsp; The temperature gradient within the ice
is
assumed to be linear, and the temperature at the bottom surface is
prescribed
to be the saltwater freezing point.&nbsp; The heat flux into the ocean
is determined by conduction down the ice temperature gradient, which is
controlled by the ice thickness and the top surface temperature. Heat
is
exchanged between the ice and the topmost ocean layer, consistent with
freezing/melting, to keep the ocean surface temperature at the
saltwater
freezing point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice dynamics and rheology are not represented.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
