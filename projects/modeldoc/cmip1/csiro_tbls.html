Model CSIRO: Elaborations</h1>
<hr>
<br>
&nbsp;
<h3><a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model CSIRO is an entry in both the CMIP1 and CMIP2 intercomparisons.
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization to the simulation starting
point
of the CSIRO coupled model is as follows (reference:<i> </i><a
 href="csiro_tbls.html#Gordon_and_O_Farrell_1997">Gordon
and O'Farrell 1997</a>):
<ul>
  <li>The atmosphere model was coupled to the dynamic sea ice model and
integrated
for many decades (without restoring forces toward climatology or
surface
stress adjustments) to ensure equilibrium of the ice.&nbsp; The surface
fluxes from the final 10 years of the integration were averaged to
obtain
a monthly climatology for use in calculating the flux adjustments for
the
coupled run.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean model started from rest and with temperature and
salinity at
each level specified from global average values after <a
 href="csiro_tbls.html#Levitus_1982">Levitus
(1982)</a>.&nbsp; It was forced at the surface with the climatological
wind stress data of <a
 href="csiro_tbls.html#Hellerman_and_Rosenstein_1983">Hellerman
and Rosenstein (1983)</a>.&nbsp; In the first phase, the ocean model
was
integrated for 1000 years with annual-mean forcing using asynchronous
time
stepping (2 days for T,S and 20 minutes for U,V); then it was
integrated
for an additional 100 years with annual mean forcing a reduced
asynchronicity
(1 day for T,S and 20 minutes for U,V); then it was integrated for an
additional
1070 years with monthly mean forcing and further-reduced asynchronicity
(1 day for T,S and 40 minutes for U,V); finally it was integrated for
710
years with monthly mean forcing using synchronous time stepping (1 hour
for T,S,U,V).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Flux adjustments for heat, salinity, and surface stresses were
calculated
following the method of <a href="#Sausen_et_al__1988">Sausen et al.
(1988)</a>
and the ocean model's SST and SSS were further corrected at each time
step
before being passed to the atmospheric model in order to reduce the
drift
in coupled mode (cf. <a href="#Gordon_and_O_Farrell_1997">Gordon and
O'Farrell
1997</a> for details).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The atmosphere/sea ice and ocean models then were coupled and run
for
105
years with these flux adjustments and corrections.&nbsp; The resulting
climate drift was modest (~ -0.4 deg&nbsp; K in 2m surface air
temperature
and ~ -0.3 deg K in SST).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land_Surface_Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
The land surface scheme is after <a href="#Kowalczyk_et_al__1991">Kowalczyk
et al. (1991,</a><a href="#Kowalczyk_et_al__1994">1994</a><a
 href="#Kowalczyk_et_al__1991">)</a>.
<ul>
  <li>The scheme includes a single-layer vegetation canopy that acts as
a
source
or sink of water vapor and sensible heat. Monthly-varying values of
local
fractional vegetation type, unconstrained stomatal resistance,
roughness
length, and albedo are specified from data of <a
 href="#Dorman_and_Sellers_1989">Dorman
and Sellers (1989)</a>. The canopy shields the ground from solar
radiation
and intercepts precipitation and dew up to a maximum depth that depends
on the leaf area index (LAI); the intercepted moisture subsequently
evaporates
at the potential rate.&nbsp;<a name="Transpiration"></a>Following the
approach
of <a href="#Noilhan_and_Planton_1989">Noilhan and Planton (1989)</a>,
evapotranspiration from the dry portion of the canopy is regulated by a
variable stomatal resistance that depends on the unconstrained value
modified
by factors associated with incident radiation, air temperature,
availability
of water in the root zone, and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. Cf. <a
 href="#Kowalczyk_et_al__1994">Kowalczyk
et al. (1991,1994) </a>for further details.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Precipitation falls as rain and, if the surface air temperature
is
below
0 deg C, freezes at the surface with release of its latent heat. The
presence
of snow modifies the roughness length and the radiative/thermal
properties
of the surface. The latter depend on the fractional snow depth: the
surface
albedo is assigned a maximum value of 0.8 when a snow scaling depth of
0.14 m is exceeded and the surface temperature is calculated using a
combined
snow/soil layer. Changes in the total snow mass are calculated from a
budget
equation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Soil temperature is calculated following <a
 href="#McGregor_et_al__1993">McGregor
et al. (1993)</a>. Three layers are used, their thicknesses (0.03,
0.23,
and 2.5 m) chosen to enable a reasonable representation of both diurnal
and seasonal temperature waves in the soil. The temperature of the i-th
layer is incremented by the diffusive heat flux into and out of the
layer.
Soil moisture is calculated using two layers, as described by <a
 href="#Kowalczyk_et_al__1994">Kowalczyk
et al. (1994)</a>. The chief source of soil moisture is surface
infiltration
which depends on precipitation, snowmelt, surface runoff, and soil
hydrological
properties; moisture sinks include evaporation from bare soil, root
extraction
associated with <a href="#Transpiration">canopy transpiration</a>, and
gravitational drainage when the local field capacity is exceeded.
Surface
runoff and gravitational drainage do not contribute to the flux of
freshwater
to the ocean model, however.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea_Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In a departure from common practice, the representation of sea
ice (<a href="#O_Farrell_1998">O'Farrell
1998</a>) is associated with the atmospheric component of the coupled
model:
physics (radiation, clouds, moisture and heat budget, etc.) are
calculated
separately for ice and open-water fractions of each grid box, and then
are combined as an area-weighted average before computing the dynamics
(advection, mixing, etc.). The ice concentration and the percentage of
open water in each grid box are determined from the energy budget of
the
ocean mixed layer adjacent to the ice: once this water reaches the
saltwater
freezing point (-1.85 deg C), new ice forms at increments of 4 percent
of the grid box. If ice advecting outside the existing area encounters
a mixed layer temperature close to the freezing point, the advected ice
is allowed to remain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Both vertical and lateral accretion of ice are
treated.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
the existing ice floe is less than 0.25 m thick, new ice is added to
its
base; otherwise, ice is added to its side. Additional ice also is added
to the base of the floe when the ice concentration is greater than
98%&nbsp;
in the Antarctic or 99.5% in the Arctic.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,
"white
ice " (cf. <a href="#Ledley__1985_">Ledley&nbsp; 1985</a>) forms from
the
overlying snow pack when it is massive enough to depress the floe
below&nbsp;
the ocean surface.&nbsp; Maximum ice thickness is constrained to 5 m,
but
only when ice&nbsp; is trapped in embayments where grid resolution
inhibits
the calculation of ice velocities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Vertical and lateral ice ablation also are represented.&nbsp;
Surface
melting
is calculated after the thermodynamic model of <a href="#Semtner_1976">Semtner
(1976)</a>&nbsp; which divides the ice system into three layers--two
for
ice and one for overlying snow, with constant albedos specified for the
two media; simulated brine pockets also provide an internal heat
source.&nbsp;
No lateral melting occurs for a system temperature between -1.85 and
-1.0
deg C.&nbsp; For a temperature between -1.0 and 0.5 deg C, any
additional
heat is partitioned between the ocean mixed layer and lateral ice
melt.&nbsp;
All additional heat goes to lateral ice melt when the temperature is
greater
than 0.5 deg C.&nbsp; Basal melt also results from ocean-to-ice heat
transfer,
which&nbsp; is proportional to the difference between the surface
temperature
of the ocean and the ice bottom at the saltwater freezing
temperature.&nbsp;
(The diffusion coefficient K = 1.5*10<sup>-6 </sup>m<sup>2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
permits the ocean temperature to rise 1 to 2 degrees above the
saltwater
freezing point without excessive melting of ice.) In the Antarctic an
additional
fixed ocean-to-ice flux of 10 Wm<sup>-2</sup> is applied to represent
the
higher transfer rates that occur during convection and the passage of
subgrid-scale
warm eddies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The model also incorporates the cavitating fluid rheology of <a
 href="#Flato_and_Hibler_1990">Flato
and Hibler (1990)</a>,&nbsp; wherein the sea ice has a finite
resistance
to compression, but can diverge freely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Convergence of ice,
with thickening by the formation of ridges, occurs when the internal
ice
pressure is exceeded.&nbsp; Divergence increases the area of open water
in leads (i.e. reduces the ice compactness) rather than affecting the
ice
thickness.&nbsp; The ice also is assumed to offer no resistance to
shear
stress; its motion is determined by a dynamical balance between the
internal
ice presssure, the atmospheric and oceanic surface stresses, and the
Coriolis
force. Ice advection is treated numerically with an upstream
differencing
scheme.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>
Ocean Component</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean component of the coupled model is based on the
Bryan-Cox code
(cf. <a href="#Cox_1984">Cox 1984</a>), and is described in <a
 href="#Hirst_et_al_2000">Hirst
et al. (2000)</a>. Temperature/salinity grid points are coincident with
the physics grid of the atmospheric model, hence the model has a
horizontal
resolution of 3.2<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font> latitude by 5.2<font
 face="Symbol">&deg;</font>
longitude. The model features three "islands" (Antarctica,
Australia-New
Guinea, New Zealand), as well as the major Eurasian-African-American
land
mass. There is no Bering Strait throughflow. Nonzero net circulation is
permitted around each island. The Mediterranean Sea and Hudson Bay are
included, and the effect of water exchange between these features and
the
North Atlantic is parameterized via a mixing of tracers across the
(unresolved)
Strait of Gibraltar and Hudson Strait.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean component has 21 levels in the vertical, with level
spacing
grading
from 25 m near the surface to 450 m in the deep ocean.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Tracers (temperature, salinity) are diffused strongly along the
neutral
density surfaces, and weakly in the vertical. The isoneutral diffusion
is performed by the <a href="#Cox_1987">Cox (1987)</a> implementation
of
the <a href="#Redi_1982">Redi (1982)</a> scheme using a uniform
isoneutral
tracer diffusivity of 1* 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.
The
vertical diffusivity is specified in terms of local static stability
according
to the formula of <a href="#Gargett_1984">Gargett (1984)</a>, however
with
a minimum allowed default value of 3 * 10<sup>-5</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp;
Larger default minima of 2 * 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
and 1 * 10<sup>-4 </sup>m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1 </sup>for vertical
diffusivity
are set between the first and second, and second and third model
levels,
respectively, to roughly simulate some wind forced mixing effect.
Convection
is simulated by applying an enhanced vertical diffusivity, of 10<sup>3</sup>
m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, in regions of static instability.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The model includes the advective form of the <a
 href="#Gent_and_McWilliams_1990">Gent
and McWilliams (1990)</a> scheme for eddy-induced transport of tracers
(cf. <a href="#Gent_et_al_1995">Gent et al. 1995</a>). The isoneutral
thickness
diffusivity is set at 1 * 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
below
270 m depth, above which this diffusivity is tapered linearly to zero
at
the surface. Horizontal tracer diffusivity is set to zero, as is common
in models employing the <a href="#Gent_and_McWilliams_1990">Gent and
McWilliams
(1990)</a> scheme.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The horizontal viscosity is set at 9 * 10<sup>5 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup>
and the vertical viscosity is set at 2 * 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>2</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup>, which are standard choices for the present resolution
(e.g.,
cf. <a href="#Bryan_et_al_1975">Bryan et al. 1975</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>
Details of the CMIP Integrations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The 100 years of output featured in CMIP 1 is for model year 111
through
model year 210 of the 1,000 year simulation described in <a
 href="#Hirst_et_al_2000">Hirst
et al. (2000)</a>. The model version employed is the same as that
described
in <a href="#Gordon_and_O_Farrell_1997">Gordon and O'Farrell (1997)</a>,
except that the <a href="#Gent_and_McWilliams_1990">Gent and
McWilliams
(1990)</a> scheme has been used in the ocean component and the number
of
oceanic levels has been increased from 12 to 21. <a
 href="#Hirst_et_al_2000">Hirst
et al. (2000)</a> give a detailed comparison of this 1,000 year
simulation
(which they refer to as "GM") with the earlier control simulation
presented
in <a href="#Gordon_and_O_Farrell_1997">Gordon and O'Farrell (1997)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The CMIP 2 integration is performed using the same model version
as for
CMIP 1, and is initialized from the model fields at the end of year 130
of the CMIP 1 simulation. Thus the 80 years of the transient CMIP 2
integration
corresponds in time to the final 80 years of the period included in
CMIP
1 from the control integration. The response of the model to the 1% per
annum compounding CO2 concentration in the CMIP 2 integration is
similar
to that shown in <a href="#Hirst_et_al_1996">Hirst et al. (1996)</a>
and <a href="#Hirst_1999">Hirst
(1999)</a> for the same model version forced according to the IPCC
IS92a
scenario. See also <a href="#Gordon_and_O_Farrell_1997">Gordon and
O'Farrell
(1997)</a> for a detailed discussion of an earlier 1%-compounding
response
experiment performed with the CSIRO model (prior to inclusion of the <a
 href="#Gent_and_McWilliams_1990">Gent
and McWilliams 1990</a> scheme).</li>
