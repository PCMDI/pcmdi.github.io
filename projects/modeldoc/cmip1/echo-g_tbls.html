Data Group (<a href="http://www.mad.zmaw.de">M&amp;D</a>)

<h3><a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model ECHO-G is an entry in CMIP2+ intercomparisons.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Greenhouse_Gas_Concentrations"></a>Greenhouse Gas

In the model control run, greenhouse gas concentrations are as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>CO<sub>2</sub>: 353 ppmv</li>
  <li>CH<sub>4</sub>: 1.72 ppmv</li>
  <li>N<sub>2</sub>O: 310ppbv</li>

  <li>HCFC22: 122 pptv</li>
  <li>CCL4: 146 pptv<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization was as follows :
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model was integrated for 18 years with prescribed
climatological
monthly mean AMIP SSTs and sea ice extents of the period 1979-1988
until
quasi-equilibrium was achieved. The climatology of ECHAM4 obtained with
a T42 resolution and AMIP SSTs is described in <a
 href="#Roeckner%20et%20al.%20%281996%29">Roeckner
et al. (1996)</a>. ECHO-G uses a T30 grid for the atmosphere. The
climatology
in this resolution is contrasted with that of the T42 resolution in <a
 href="#Stendel%20et%20al.%20%281998%29">Stendel
and Roeckner (1998)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The uncoupled ocean model was spun up for 2034 years while being
forced
by surface daily fields as obtained in the last 15 years of the
above&nbsp;
described standalone ECHAM4/T42 integration with climatological AMIP
SSTs.
Freshwater, heat, and momentum fluxes were applied equatorwards of the
climatological AMIP sea ice extents only. Poleward of the sea ice
extents,
near surface fields,&nbsp; obtained in the same ECHAM4 integration were
used. The near surface fields (surface wind, dew point temperature,
2m-temperature)
were transformed into fluxes with bulk formulas as described in <a
 href="#Parkinson%20and%20Washington%20%281979%29">Parkinson
and Washington (1979)</a>. The 15-year daily forcing data were
cyclically
repeated over the spin-up period. In addition to this forcing the ocean
SSTs and SSSs were relaxed to the climatological monthly AMIP SSTs
which
were used during the calculation of the atmospheric forcing data,
assuming
a heat flux of 40 W/(m**2K).&nbsp; SSSs were relaxed to the annual <a
 href="#Levitus%20et%20al.%20%281994%29">Levitus
et al. (1994)</a> climatology on the same time scale (30 days). More
details
are found in <a href="#Legutke%20and%20Maier-Reimer%20%281999%29">Legutke
and Maier-Reimer
(1999)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric and oceanic models were coupled and integrated
for 155
years, while restoring SST and SSS toward climatological values. No
relaxation
fluxes were applied in the climatological sea ice regions. From the
last
100 years of this coupled integration, annual mean freshwater and heat
fluxes were diagnosed from the relaxation terms. The fluxes were then
globally
normalized to zero. These fields were applied in the coupled
experiments
as flux corrections (see also&nbsp; <a
 href="#Marsland%20et%20al.%20%282003%29">Marsland
et al. (2003)</a> , <a href="#Min_et_al._2004">Min et al. 2004</a>,
and <a href="#Min_et_al._2005a">Min et al. 2005a</a>, <a
 href="#Min_et_al_2005b">b</a> for further
details).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The treatment of land surface processes in the ECHAM4 model is
the same
as that in the ECHAM3 model, except that the heat capacity, thermal
conductivity,
and field capacity for soil moisture are prescribed according to
geographically
varying values derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
soil
type distributions (cf. <a href="#Patterson%201990">Patterson 1990</a>,
and <a href="#Zobler%201986">Zobler
1986</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Soil temperature is determined after <a
 href="#Warrilow%20et%20al.%201986">Warrilow
et al. (1986)</a> from the heat conduction in 5 layers (proceeding
downward,
layer thicknesses are 0.065, 0.254, 0.913, 2.902, and 5.70 m), with net
surface heat fluxes as the upper boundary condition and zero heat flux
as the lower boundary condition at 10 m depth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Snow pack temperature is also computed from the soil heat
equation
using
heat diffusivity/capacity for ice in regions of permanent continental
ice,
and for bare soil where water-equivalent snow depth is &lt;0.025 m. For
snow of greater depth, the temperature of the middle of the snow pack
is
solved from an auxiliary heat conduction equation (cf. <a
 href="#Bauer%20et%20al.%201985">Bauer
et al. 1985</a>). The temperature at the upper surface is determined by
extrapolation, but it is constrained not to exceed the snowmelt
temperature
of 0 degrees C.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>There are separate prognostic moisture budgets for snow,
vegetation
canopy,
and soil reservoirs. Snow cover is augmented by snowfall and is
depleted
by sublimation and melting. Snow melts (augmenting soil moisture) if
the
temperatures of the snow pack and of the uppermost soil layer exceed 0
degrees C. The canopy intercepts precipitation and snow (proportional
to
the vegetated fraction of a grid box), which is then subject to
immediate
evaporation or melting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <font size="+0">Soil moisture is represented as a single-layer
"bucket" model
(cf. <a href="#Manabe%201969">Manabe 1969</a>), but with field
capacity that
varies according to soil type (</font><a href="#Patterson%201990">Patterson
1990)</a>. <font size="+0">Direct evaporation of soil moisture from
bare
soil and from the wet vegetation canopy, as well as evapotranspiration
via root uptake, are modeled. Surface runoff includes effects of
subgrid-scale
variations of field capacity related to the orographic variance; in
addition,
wherever the soil is frozen, moisture contributes to surface runoff
instead
of soil moisture. Deep runoff due to drainage processes also occurs
independently
of infiltration if the soil moisture is between 5 and 9 percent of
field
capacity (slow drainage), or is larger than 90 percent of field
capacity
(fast drainage). When the model atmosphere is coupled to a dynamical
ocean,
this source of freshwater is discharged at coastal points by means of a
river transport model that uses local runoff as input. Cf. <a
 href="#D%FCmenil_and_Todini_1992_">D&uuml;menil
and Todini (1992)</a> and <a href="#Sausen%20et%20al.%201994">Sausen
et al. (1994)</a>
for further details.</font></li>
  <br>
  <font size="+0">Since surface melt and accumulation of snow on
continental
ice sheets is not balanced, even for very long time scales, the ice
sheets
(of Greenland and Antarctica)&nbsp; serve as sinks of snow in the
coupled
model. In order to keep the heat and salt balance closed, the mass of
the
ice sheets is kept constant by routing the surplus of the mass balance
into the ocean grid cells aroubd the coast. In addition a corresponding
flux of latent heat of fusion is transfered into the ocean as well.
This
serves to simulate the effects of melt of ice shelves by sea water and
the discharge of ice streams into the ocean.</font>
</ul>
<h3>
<br>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The dynamic part of the sea ice model is based on that of <a
 href="#Hibler%201979">Hibler
(1979)</a>, recoded on the ocean model grid (Arakawa-E). It predicts
ice
thickness and concentration, snow depth, ice/scnow cover momentum. The
snow pack is accumulating on the ice according to the solid freshwater
fluxes given to the ocean.&nbsp; Surface melt of snow or ice and bottom
melt or ablation of ice is calculated from the residual surface fluxes
on the snow/ice layer and the conductive fluxes through the snow/ice
cover,
which are both calculated in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Each ocean grid cell
of the atmosphere grid can be partially covered by sea ice. All fluxes
on these cells are calculated twice with the respective surface
conditions
of the sea ice and the open water (<a
 href="#Groetzner%20et%20al.%20%281996%29">Groetzner
et al. (1996)</a>) .The conversion from snow to ice also is
parameterized.
See <a href="#Wolff%20et%20al.%20%281997%29">Wolff et al. (1997)</a>
for more details.</li>
