Model GISS (Miller): Elaborations</h1>
<h3>
<hr width="100%"></h3>
&nbsp;
<h3><a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model GISS (Miller) is an entry in the CMIP1 intercomparison only.
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization to the simulation starting
point
of the coupled model is as follows (cf. <a
 href="#Miller%20and%20Jiang%201996">Miller
and Jiang 1996</a>):
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model was integrated for a decade with AMIP
ocean/sea
ice
boundary conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The computed surface winds then were used to force the ocean
model,
while
restoring the SST and SSS to Levitus (1982) annual-mean values. The
ocean
model was integrated for 6000 x 365 ocean-tracer time steps (equivalent
to 6000 years of the tracer field, with time step length of 1 day).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Seasonally varying values of SST and SSS then were used to force
the
ocean
model for an additional 500 years, with the tracer time step reduced
from
1 day to 4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>At this point, the globally integrated surface energy flux
(proportional
to the difference between the Levitus temperature and the first model
layer
temperature) was &lt; 0.001 W m-2, and the ocean and atmosphere models
were coupled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The coupled model was integrated for 110 years without flux
adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soil temperature is computed by solving a heat diffusion equation
in
six
layers. The thickness of the top layer varies, but is approximately 0.1
m. The thicknesses of deeper layers increase geometrically, with the
bottom
boundary of the soil column at a nominal bedrock depth of 3.444 m. The
upper boundary condition is the balance of surface energy fluxes; at
the
bottom boundary, zero net heat flux is specified. The thermal
conductivity
and heat capacity of the ground vary with snow cover, as well as soil
moisture
amount and phase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <font size="+0">Land-surface hydrology is treated after the
physically based
model of <a href="#Abramopoulos%20et%20al.%201988">Abramopoulos et al.
(1988)</a>.
The scheme includes a vegetation canopy, a composite over each grid box
from the vegetation types of <a href="#Matthews%201983">Matthews
(1983, 1984</a>),
that intercepts precipitation and dew. Evaporation from the wet canopy
and from bare soil is treated, as well as soil-moisture loss from
transpiration
according to moisture availability and variable vegetation resistance
and
root density. Diffusion of moisture is predicted in the six soil
layers,
accounting for spatially variable composite conductivities and matric
potentials
that depend on soil type and moisture content. Infiltration of
precipitation
and snowmelt is explicitly calculated, with surface runoff occurring
when
the uppermost soil layer is saturated; underground runoff that depends
on topographic slope also is included.</font></li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice is represented by the two-layer model of <a
 href="#Hansen%201983">Hansen
et al. (1983)</a>, where the top layer simulates accumulating snow up
to
a depth of 0.1 m.&nbsp; When this threshold depth is exceeded, 0.01m of
the snow is added to the lower layer as ice, thereby keeping the upper
layer thin enough to simulate diurnal temperature changes. A fraction
of
an ocean grid square may be covered by ice at a thickness that is a
function
of the fractional coverage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The snow-free albedo of sea ice is 0.55 in the visible
(wavelengths
&lt;
0.7micrometers) and 0.3 in the near-infrared, resulting in a spectrally
weighted ice albedo of 0.45.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice dynamics and rheology are neglected.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Diffs_AMIP"></a><font size="+1">Chief Differences from Closest
AMIP
Model</font></h3>
The atmospheric component of the GISS (Miller) coupled model (internal
designation: Model B122AM9) differs from AMIP model <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/20giss_ToC.html">GISS
Model II Prime (4x5, L9) 1994</a> (internal designation: Model B150AM9)
mainly in the following respects:
<ul>
  <a name="Horizontal Representation"></a><b><font size="+1">Horizontal
Representation</font></b>
  <p>A linear upstream scheme is used for the advection of tracers,
rather
than the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/20giss.html#RTFToC7">AMIP
model's</a> more accurate quadratic advection scheme. </p>
  <p><a name="Chemistry"></a><b><font size="+1">Chemistry</font></b> </p>
  <p>The<b><font size="+1"> </font></b>model lacks the improved
aerosol climatology
used in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/20giss.html#RTFToC23">AMIP
model</a>. </p>
  <p><a name="Radiation"></a><b><font size="+1">Radiation</font></b> </p>
  <p>Rather than calculating radiative fluxes at every horizontal grid
point
as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/20giss.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model</a>, these fluxes are computed only at every other horizontal
grid
point, using interpolation to obtain values at intermediate grid
points. </p>
  <p><a name="Diffs Land Surface Processes"></a><b><font size="+1">Land
Surface
Processes</font></b> </p>
  <p>The <a href="#Land%20Surface%20Processes">land surface hydrology</a>
scheme
is somewhat less sophisticated than that of the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/20giss.html#RTFToC35">AMIP
model</a>.</p>
