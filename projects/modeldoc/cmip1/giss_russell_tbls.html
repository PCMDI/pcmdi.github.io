<a name="Top of Page"></a>Model GISS (Russell): Elaborations</h1>
<h3>

<h3>
<a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model GISS (Russell) is an entry in both the CMIP1 and CMIP2
intercomparisons.
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization to the simulation starting
point
of the coupled model is as follows (cf.<i> </i><a
 href="#Russell%20et%20al.%201995">Russell
et al. 1995</a>).
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model was initialized from the NMC analysis for
December
1, 1977.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean model was initialized from the <a
 href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus
(1982)</a> temperature and salinity fields.&nbsp; In the upper 1500 m,
the Levitus seasonal climatology was temporally interpolated to obtain
values appropriate for December 1; below 1500 m, Levitus annual-mean
data
were used. (The Levitus climatologies on 33 vertical levels were
vertically
integrated to the 13 layers in the ocean model.) The initial ocean
free-surface
boundary condition was zero elevation everywhere (i.e., mean sea-level
conditions).&nbsp; All ocean currents were initially 0, but the height
field adjusted soon after the start of coupled integration to conform
to
that for geostrophic flow.&nbsp; The initial heat and salt in the
model's
straits were calculated by using the ocean values at the two ends of
each
strait.&nbsp; The initial sea ice distribution was after <a
 href="#Walsh%20and%20Johnson%201979">Walsh
and Johnson (1979)</a> in the Northern Hemisphere, and after <a
 href="#Alexander%20and%20Mobley%201976">Alexander
and Mobley (1976)</a> in the Southern Hemisphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric and ocean models were coupled and integrated for
120
years
without flux adjustment, the ocean's peak heat transports becoming
relatively
stable after about 25 years.&nbsp; Thereafter, a slow climate drift was
evident in the (increasing) sea ice extents in the North Atlantic, the
(weakening) thermohaline circulation, the (decreasing) elevation of the
ocean's free surface, the imbalance of 3.7 W m^-2 in ocean surface
radiative
fluxes, and the 0.007 degrees K per year warming in the mass-weighted
vertically
integrated ocean temperature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soil temperature is computed by solving a heat diffusion equation
in
two
layers, where the upper layer (depth 0.1 m) simulates diurnal
fluctuations,
and the lower layer (depth 4 m) seasonal variations. Thermal
conductivity
and heat capacity vary with snow cover and soil moisture amount and
phase
(i.e., liquid vs solid water). In vegetated regions during winter, the
thermal conductivity also reflects the insulating effects of dead grass
and leaves.</li>
  <li>Soil moisture, predicted in two layers, is expressed as a ratio
of
available
water to field capacity, which is a function of surface type and
vegetation
according to <a href="#Matthews%201983">Matthews (1983,</a><a
 href="#Matthews%201984">
1984</a><a href="#Matthews%201983">).</a> Soil moisture in the upper
layer
reflects short-term variations in hydrological variables, while that of
the lower layer functions as a reservoir. Surface evaporation is
parameterized
as the product of the fractional wetness of the upper layer and the
potential
evaporation. Moisture diffusion from the lower layer varies seasonally
to account for greater potential for depletion of this reservoir during
the growing season; otherwise, the effects of a vegetation canopy are
not
explicitly simulated. Runoff is represented as one-half the product of
the fractional wetness of the upper layer and the rainfall rate, with
additional
runoff
occuring as needed to keep the fractional wetness no larger than unity.
C<font size="+0">f. <a href="#Hansen%20et%20al.%201983">Hansen et al.
1983</a>
for further details.</font></li>
  <li>Runoff is returned to the ocean by means of a river transport
model
(cf. <a href="#Miller%20et%20al.%201994">Miller
et al. 1994</a>). Runoff instantaneously increases the river and lake
mass
of a grid box, which is also affected by the local balance of
precipitation
and evaporation. For each continental grid box, a river direction file
indicates the downstream routing to one of the 8 neighboring grid
boxes.
The mass flux out of a grid box is computed as a function of the river
and lake mass that lies above the local sill depth, an effective flow
speed
that depends on the local orography gradient, and the mean distance to
the downstream neighbor. Flow speeds are globally optimized to ensure
that
fresh water arrives at coastal grid boxes with the proper seasonal
timing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice forms when the uppermost ocean layer cools below the
freezing
point
of salt water. Ice cover is determined both by energy exchange with the
atmosphere and by ocean heat transport and heat capacity, following <a
 href="#Hansen%201988">Hansen
et al. (1988)</a>. Initially, the ice is 0.5 m thick; as it melts, the
ice is contracted horizontally so as to maintain a 0.5 m thickness. The
area of ice leads is calculated after the method of <a
 href="#Hansen%20et%20al.%201983">Hansen
et al. (1983)</a>: the minimum fraction of open ocean area in a grid
box
varies inversely with the ice thickness. As sea ice forms or thickens,
the salinity of the uppermost ocean layer increases.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Snow also may accumulate on the ice, and a two-layer model
determines
the
temperatures within the ice and the snow pack. When, from consideration
of surface heat balance, the temperature begins to exceed the
freshwater
melt temperature of 0 deg C, it remains there as long as the ice/snow
melting
continues.&nbsp; If the temperature of the uppermost ocean layer rises
above 0 deg C, the sea ice melts both vertically and laterally, thereby
keeping the ocean temperature at 0 deg C.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice is not advected; instead, the atmospheric momentum stress
on
the
ice is passed directly to the uppermost layer of the ocean model.</li>
</ul>
