Model IAP/LASG1: Elaborations</h1>

Model IAP/LASG1 is an entry in the CMIP1 intercomparison only.
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization to the simulation starting
point
of the IAP/LASG coupled model for the CMIP intercomparison was as
follows:
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model (including soil moisture/temperature and
snow
cover/depth)
was initialized from a previous simulation with prescribed SSTs (cf. <a
 href="#Wu%20et%20al.%201996">Wu
et al. 1996</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The oceanic model was spun up for 1700 years from an at-rest
initial
state
with zonal-mean temperature and salinity specified from <a
 href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus
(1982)</a>. During the spinup, the model was forced by observed wind
stresses
after <a href="#Hellerman%20and%20Rosenstein%201983">Hellerman and
Rosenstein
(1983)</a>, heat fluxes after <a href="#Haney%201971">Haney (1971)</a>
using
observed atmospheric variables of <a
 href="#Esbensen%20and%20Kushnir%201981">Esbensen
and Kushnir (1981)</a>, and <a href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus (1982)</a>
observations of skin surface salinity (cf. <a
 href="#Zhang%20et%20al.%201996">Zhang
et al. 1996</a>, <a href="#Yu%201997">Yu 1997</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric and oceanic models were coupled (cf. <a
 href="#Zhang%20et%20al.%201992">Zhang
et al. 1992)</a> and integrated for a total of 200 years using a
monthly
anomaly exchange scheme (cf. <a href="#Liu%20et%20al.%201996">Liu et
al. 1996</a>
and <a href="#Yu%20and%20Zhang%201997">Yu and Zhang 1997</a>) that
functions
as a flux correction for heat and momentum. The ocean model's surface
salinity
also was restored to <a href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus (1982)</a>
observations.
Data from years 131 through 180 of the coupled simulation were supplied
to CMIP I.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a><font size="+1">Land Surface
Processes</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Land surface processes are simulated following the <a
 href="#Xue%20et%20al.%201991">Xue
et al. (1991)</a> modification of the SiB model of <a
 href="#Sellers%20et%20al.%201986">Sellers
et al. (1986)</a>. Within the single-story vegetation canopy,
evapotranspiration
from dry leaves includes detailed modeling of stomatal and canopy
resistances;
direct evaporation from the wet canopy and from bare soil is also
treated.
Precipitation interception by the canopy is simulated, and its
infiltration
into the ground is limited to less than the hydraulic conductivity of
the
soil.</li>
  <br>
&nbsp; <li>Soil temperature is determined in two layers by the
force-restore
method
of <a href="#Deardorff%201978">Deardorff (1978)</a>. Soil moisture,
which
is predicted from diffusion equations in three layers, is increased by
infiltrated precipitation and snowmelt, and is depleted by
evapotranspiration,
direct evaporation, and drainage. Both surface runoff and deep runoff
from
gravitational drainage are simulated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice is represented as a horizontally uniform slab without
snow or
leads.&nbsp;
Brine rejection processes are not parameterized; instead, an enhanced
but
seasonally invariant salinity forcing similar to that of <a
 href="#England%201993">England
(1993)</a> is imposed near Antarctica to account for the effects on the
thermohaline circulation.</li>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <p>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <li>The ice albedo is a constant 0.5 and the solar penetration
through the
ice is set to 0.068. Ice formation, accretion, and ablation are
determined
by the net balance among the atmospheric heat fluxes at the top surface
of the ice, the oceanic turbulent heat flux at the bottom of the ice,
and
the conductive heat flux within the ice.&nbsp; The atmospheric heat
flux
is calculated after <a href="#Haney%201971">Haney (1971)</a> in the
same
way as over open ocean, except for inclusion of the ice albedo and
latent
heat of evaporation. The heat flux at the ice bottom is proportional to
the temperature of the underlying ocean and the salt-water freezing
point
temperature.&nbsp; A simple thermodynamic model after <a
 href="#Semtner%201976">Semtner
(1976)</a> and <a href="#Parkinson%20and%20Washington%201979">Parkinson
and Washington
(1979)</a> calculates temperatures within the sea ice from
one-dimensional
heat equations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice rheology and dynamics are neglected.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Diffs_AMIP"></a>Chief Differences from Closest AMIP Model</h3>
The principal features of the IAP/LASG atmospheric model are documented
by <a href="#Wu%20et%20al.%201996">Wu et al. (1996)</a>. Besides a
reduction
in horizontal resolution (to R15), the chief differences from the
closest
AMIP model, <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/11bmrc_ToC.html">BMRC
