Model LMD/IPSL1: Elaborations
<hr width="100%"></h1>
<h3>
<a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model LMD/IPSL1 is an entry in the CMIP1 intercomparison only.
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization of the LMD/IPSL coupled model
is
as follows (reference:&nbsp;<i> </i>Laurent Fairhead, personal
communication):
<p>The CMIP I simulation starting point was the tenth year of a
previous
coupled model integration which was initialized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model was started from 1 January 1980 of an
(uncoupled)
AMIP simulation which began on 1 January 1979.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean model was initialized from the <a
 href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus
(1982)</a> temperature and salinity fields for climatological January.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric and ocean models were coupled without any further
spinup
and without application of flux adjustment (i.e., a "cold start").</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soil thermodynamics is determined by a 7-layer heat transfer
model. The
7 layers are of uneven depths and are spaced between 0.02 m and 3.0 m
below
the surface, providing for resolution of thermal forcing at periods
from
0.5 hour to 2 years. A zero-flux condition is imposed at the model's
lower
boundary, and the thermal insulation of snow is accounted for at its
upper
boundary. Introduction of the 7-layer model impacts ground temperature,
snow mass/melt, and the seasonal change in prescribed vegetation that
is
tied to the soil temperature at a depth of 0.4 m. In turn, changes in
snow
cover and vegetation affect the albedo and roughness length over land.
Cf. <a href="#Polcher%201994">Polcher (1994)</a> for further details.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <a name="SECHIBA"></a>Soil hydrology is simulated using the
land
surface
scheme SECHIBA (Sch&eacute;matisation des Echanges Hydriques &agrave;
l'
Interface entre la Biosph&egrave;re et l'Atmosph&egrave;re). The total
depth of the soil column (corresponding to the vegetation root zone) is
a constant 1.0 m. Soil moisture is computed in two layers, the upper
layer
being the most reactive: when precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration,
the upper layer fills first; when the reverse is true, it empties
first.
Runoff occurs whenever the soil column is completely saturated (water
depth
0.15 m). The remaining prescribed parameters for bare soil are a
constant
evaporative resistance and an empirical constant used to compute
surface
relative humidity for calculation of evaporation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In SECHIBA, each of the 7 prescribed vegetation classes interact
individually
with the soil hydrology and contribute individually to the surface
evaporative
flux. All the vegetation is assumed to have a single-story canopy that
transpires or intercepts precipitation, but the canopy moisture
capacity
varies with the leaf area index, which is prescribed differently for
each
vegetation class. Different architectural and canopy resistances for
evaporation/transpiration
also are prescribed for each vegetation class. Cf <a
 href="#Ducoudre%20et%20al.%201993">Ducoudre
et al. (1993)</a> for further details. See also <a
 href="#Surface%20Fluxes">Surface
Fluxes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice extents are diagnostically determined, as described by <a
 href="#Braconnot%201997">Braconnot
et. al (1997)</a>.&nbsp; Ice forms in an ocean grid box with surface
temperature
less than the freezing point for salt water. The underlying ocean is
assumed
to supply the ice with a a constant heat flux of 2 W m<sup>-2</sup> in
the Arctic and 4 W m<sup>-2</sup> in the Antarctic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The upper surface temperature of the ice is determined from the
net
atmospheric
heat flux and the heat conduction from the ocean below, where the
latter
is inversely proportional to the ice thickness (assumed to be a
constant
3 m).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice dynamics and rheology are neglected.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Diffs_AMIP"></a><font size="+1">Chief Differences from Closest
AMIP
Model</font></h3>
The atmospheric model (designated as version LMD5.3) is as described by
<a href="#Harzallah%20and%20Sadourny%201995">Harzallah&amp;Sadourny(1995)</a>.
Aside from its use of higher atmospheric horizontal and vertical
resolution,
model LMD5.3 differs in the following respects from AMIP model <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd_ToC.html">LMD
LMD5 (3.6 x 5.6 L11)</a>:
<ul>
  <h3> <a name="Radiation"></a><font size="+1">Radiation</font></h3>
  <font size="+0">The interaction of radiation and cloud has been
subject to
some tuning. As in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model</a>, cloud optical thickness and emissivity are determined from
the
cloud liquid water path <b>W</b> (in kg m<sup>-</sup></font><sup>2</sup><font
 size="+0">),
the effective radius <b>r</b> of cloud droplets (in m), and the
absorption
coefficient <b>k</b> (in m<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>); however, the
prognostic
cloud liquid water content (LWC) (and therefore <b>W</b>) as well as <b>r</b>
and <b>k</b> are determined differently:</font> <br>
&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li> <font size="+0">The LWC changes because of the introduction
of a
different
parameterization of <a href="#Precipitation">precipitation</a>. Also,
in
place of the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model's</a> specification of <b>r</b> as a linear function of LWC, the
effective droplet radius in the CMIP I experiment is prescribed as 10
microns
for warm (water) clouds </font>(with cloud-top temperatures &gt; 0 C) <font
 size="+0">and
as 40 microns for cold (ice) clouds </font>(with cloud-top
temperatures
&lt; -25 deg C). <font size="+0">(In the CMIP II experiments, <b>r</b>
is
set to somewhat different values.)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <font size="+0">The absorption constant <b>k</b> is also
different for warm
and cold clouds: 130 m<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup> and 50 m<sup>2</sup>
kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, rather than a constant 130 m<sup>2</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>for
      <i>all</i>
clouds, as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model</a>.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>In each grid box, warm clouds constitute a fraction <b>X</b>,
and cold
clouds a fraction <b>1-X</b> of the total cloud cover, where <b>X = 0</b>
for temperatures below -25 deg C and <b>X</b> = 1 for temperatures
above
0 deg C; <b>X</b> is assumed to vary linearly for intermediate
temperatures.
(Somewhat different temperature bounds are specified in the CMIP II
experiments.)</li>

for

  <h3><a name="Precipitation"></a><font size="+1">Precipitation</font></h3>
In place of the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC27">AMIP
model's </a>sharp distinction between precipitation in warm vs cold
clouds,
a smoother transition is specified in model LMD5.3: <br>
&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>For warm (water) clouds, the precipitation rate is
parameterized after <a href="#Sundqvist%201981">Sundqvist
(1981)</a> as the product of a characteristic precipitation time scale <b>T</b>
(value = 5.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), the prognostic cloud
liquid
water mixing ratio <b>m</b>, and an exponential function of (<b>m</b>/<b>C</b>)<sup>2</sup>,
where <b>C</b> is a prescribed precipitation threshold value = 2 x 10<sup>-4</sup>
kg/kg.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>For cold (ice) clouds, the precipitation rate is determined by
the
ratio
of <b>m</b> to a different timescale <b>t</b> = <b>z</b>/<b>v</b>,
where <b>z</b>
is the depth of the vertical layer and <b>v</b> is the terminal
velocity
of the water droplets, which is determined as an empirical function of <b>m</b>
after <a href="#Heymsfield%20and%20Donner%201990">Heymsfield and
Donner (1990)</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The proportion of liquid and ice water mass within the clouds
varies
linearly
between 0 and -25 deg C.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br>
As in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC27">AMIP
model</a>, evaporation of falling convective and large-scale
precipitation
is not explicitly modeled, but evaporation of small stratiform cloud
droplets
is simulated stochastically. </p>
  <h3><a name="Surface Characteristics"></a><font size="+1">Surface
Characteristics</font></h3>
The formulation of surface characteristics in model LMD5.3 is the same
as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC33">AMIP
model</a>, except for the following features: <br>
&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>Fractional <a href="#Sea%20Ice">sea ice</a> and free ocean
conditions
may
be specified within a single grid box, with roughness lengths and <a
 href="#Surface%20Fluxes">surface
fluxes</a> computed separately over ocean and ice. Roughness lengths
over
ice surfaces are a uniform 1.1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m. Over ocean,
roughness
lengths are evaluated as a function of wind speed according to <a
 href="#Charnock%201955">Charnock
(1955)</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Over ocean, the surface albedo is specified according to <a
 href="#Larson%20and%20Barkstrom%201977">Larson
and Barkstrom (1977)</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> <a name="Surface Fluxes"></a><font size="+1">Surface Fluxes</font></h3>
In its treatment of surface fluxes, model LMD5.3 differs in the
following
respects from the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC34">AMIP
model</a>: <br>
&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>The surface drag coefficient for the momentum, sensible heat,
and
evaporative
fluxes depends on surface roughness and stability, following the
approach
of <a href="#Louis%201979">Louis (1979).</a></li>
    <br>
&nbsp; <li>In addition, over the continents, the surface evaporative
flux
is determined
by the <a href="#SECHIBA">SECHIBA land surface scheme.</a> The
evaporative
flux is calculated separately for each of the 8 coexisting surface
types
(bare ground plus 7 vegetation classes with fractional areas specified
according to grid box) that are also present in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/24lmd.html#RTFToC33">AMIP
model</a>. The total evaporative flux in each grid box then is computed
as an area-weighted average of the individual fluxes. The total flux
includes
sublimation from snow, evaporation from bare soil and from moisture
intercepted
by the canopy of each vegetation class, and transpiration from the dry
foliage of each class. Sublimation and evaporation from intercepted
canopy
moisture occur at the potential rate, while canopy transpiration and
evaporation
from bare soil depend on the surface relative humidity, which is
parameterized
in terms of soil moisture. Evaporation from sub-canopy soil is
neglected.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>In SECHIBA also, the surface evaporative flux is computed by a
bulk
method
that depends on the moisture gradient between the surface and the
overlying
air, and on resistances of different kinds (aerodynamic, soil,
architectural,
and canopy) that vary according to surface type and/or the nature of
the
moisture flux (sublimation, evaporation, transpiration). Cf. <a
 href="#Ducoudre%20et%20al.%201993">Ducoudre
et al. (1993)</a> for further details. See also <a href="#Diffs_LSP">Land
Surface Processes</a>.</li>
