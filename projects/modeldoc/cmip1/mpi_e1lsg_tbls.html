Model ECHAM1+LSG: Elaborations</h1>
<hr width="100%">
<p>Note: The ECHAM1 + LSG model was jointly sponsored by the Max Planck
Institut f&uuml;r Meteorologie (MPI) and the Deutsches
Klimarechenzentrum
(<a href="http://www.dkrz.de/">DKRZ</a>).

Model ECHAM1+LSG is an entry in the CMIP1 intercomparison only.

<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization to the simulation starting
point
of the MPI (ECHAM1+LSG) coupled model is as follows (references:
<a href="#Cubasch%20et%20al.%201992">Cubasch
et al. 1992</a>,

<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model was integrated with prescribed
climatological
SSTs
and sea ice extents derived from the AMIP data until quasi-equilibrium
was achieved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean model was integrated first with prescribed <a
 href="#Hellerman%20and%20Rosenstein%201983">Hellerman
and Rosenstein (1983)</a> wind stresses, and was relaxed toward surface
salinity data of <a href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus (1982)</a>,
together with
a feedback to effective monthly mean surface air temperatures
constructed
from the COADS data set (cf. <a href="#Woodruff%20et%20al.%201987">Woodruff
et
al. 1987</a>). In a second stage, the diagnosed freshwater fluxes from
this run, together with the same surface wind stresses and surface air
temperatures then were used as external forcing (along with a mild
relaxation
to AMIP SSTs). In a third stage, the ocean model was integrated further
with the forcings of the second stage, except for the additional
application
of monthly mean values of the daily forcing anomalies. The total length
of the three stages was ~7,000 years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model then was integrated again to
quasi-equilibrium (a
20-year run), with SSTs and sea ice extents derived from the third
stage
of the ocean-only run. Monthly mean flux corrections for heat,
freshwater,
momentum (surface wind stresses) were computed following the method of <a
 href="#Sausen%20et%20al.%201988">Sausen
et al. 1988</a>. The SSTs were also flux-corrected to adjust for the
mean
bias between the AMIP and COADS climatologies.</li>
  <li>The atmospheric and oceanic models then were coupled and
integrated
with
the application of these fixed monthly mean flux corrections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soil temperature is determined after <a
 href="#Warrilow%20et%20al.%201986">Warrilow
et al. (1986)</a> from the heat conduction in 5 layers (proceeding
downward,
layer thicknesses are 0.065, 0.254, 0.913, 2.902, and 5.70 m), with net
surface heat fluxes as the upper boundary condition and zero heat flux
as the lower boundary condition at 10 m depth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Snow pack temperature is also computed from the soil heat
equation
using
heat diffusivity/capacity for ice in regions of permanent continental
ice,
and for bare soil where water-equivalent snow depth is &lt;0.025 m. For
snow of greater depth, the temperature of the middle of the snow pack
is
solved from an auxiliary heat conduction equation (cf. <a
 href="#Bauer%20et%20al.%201985">Bauer
et al. 1985</a>). The temperature at the upper surface is determined by
extrapolation, but it is constrained not to exceed the snowmelt
temperature
of 0 degrees C.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>There are separate prognostic moisture budgets for snow,
vegetation
canopy,
and soil reservoirs. Snow cover is augmented by snowfall and is
depleted
by sublimation and melting. Snow melts (augmenting soil moisture) if
the
temperatures of the snow pack and of the uppermost soil layer exceed 0
degrees C. The canopy intercepts precipitation and snow (proportional
to
the vegetated fraction of a grid box), which is then subject to
immediate
evaporation or melting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Soil moisture is represented as a single-layer "bucket" model
(cf. <a href="#Manabe%201969">Manabe
1969)</a> with field capacity 0.20 m that is modified to account for
vegetative
and orographic effects. Direct evaporation of soil moisture from bare
soil
and from the wet vegetation canopy, as well as evapotranspiration via
root
uptake, are modeled. Surface runoff includes effects of subgrid-scale
variations
of field capacity related to the orographic variance; in addition,
wherever
the soil is frozen, moisture contributes to surface runoff instead of
soil
moisture. Deep runoff due to drainage processes also occurs
independently
of infiltration if the soil moisture is between 5 and 9 percent of
field
capacity (slow drainage), or is larger than 90 percent of field
capacity
(fast drainage). When the model atmosphere is coupled to a dynamical
ocean,
this source of freshwater is discharged at coastal points by means of a
river transport model that uses local runoff as input. Cf. D&uuml;menil
and Todini (1992) and <a href="#Sausen%20et%20al.%201994">Sausen et
al. (1994)</a>
for further details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only the thermodyamics of sea ice are represented. Ice forms when
a net
heat loss from the ocean would cause the SST to fall below the freezing
point.&nbsp; Existing ice thickens/melts in relation to the available
heat
of fusion when the net heat flux is upward/downward. The heat flux is
calculated
from a surface energy balance which includes a conductive heat flux
between
the ocean and sea ice, based on the assumption of a linear temperature
profile.&nbsp; The surface albedo of the ice is assumed to remain
constant;
solar penetration, brine pockets, or other internal heat capacities are
not parameterized.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Snow cover is not represented and a modification of the heat flux
by
leads
or partial ice cover is not accounted for.&nbsp; Salinity changes are
associated
with changes of the volume of the sea ice on the asumption of constant
sea-ice salinity.</li>
</ul>
