Model ECHAM4+OPYC3: Elborations</h1>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h3>
Note: The ECHAM4 + OPYC3 model was jointly sponsored by the Max Planck
Institut f&uuml;r Meteorologie (MPI) and the Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum
(<a href="http://www.dkrz.de/">DKRZ</a>).
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model ECHAM4+OPYC3 is an entry in both the CMIP1 and CMIP2 intercomparisons.
<h3>
<a NAME="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization was as follows (cf. <a href="#Roeckner et al. 1996">Roeckner
et al. 1996</a> for further details):
<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Stand-alone atmospheric simulation"></a>The atmospheric model
was integrated for ~20 years with prescribed AMIP SSTs and sea ice extents
until quasi-equilibrium was achieved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The uncoupled ocean model was first spun up for ~500 years while being
forced by surface climatological fluxes. The climatological wind stress
and friction velocity were obtained from the <a href="#Stand-alone atmospheric simulation">stand-alone
atmospheric simulation</a>; the fluxes of heat and freshwater were derived
from an observed climatology (cf. <a href="#Oberhuber 1988">Oberhuber 1988</a>),
a bulk flux parameterization (cf. <a href="#Oberhuber 1993a">Oberhuber
1993 a</a>,<a href="#Oberhuber 1993b">b</a>), and additional relaxation
towards the observational climatologies of AMIP SSTs and <a href="#Levitus 1982">Levitus
(1982)</a> SSS. The ocean model then was spun up for an additional 500
years while being forced by daily anomalies of heat and freshwater flux
derived from the <a href="#Stand-alone atmospheric simulation">stand-alone
atmospheric simulation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The atmospheric and oceanic models were coupled and integrated for 100
years, while restoring the SST and SSS toward climatological values. Over
the 100-year coupled simulation, the impact of the associated Newtonian
feedbacks on the SST and SSS were gradually decreased to zero, while these
feedback terms were integrated at full weight in order to derive annual-mean
flux adjustments for heat and freshwater. After 100 years of coupled integration,
the annual-mean flux adjustments were frozen, and then were applied throughout
the subsequent 240-year control run of the coupled model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The treatment of land surface processes in the MPI ECHAM4 model is the
same as that in the <a href="#Land Surface Processes">MPI ECHAM3 model</a>,
except that the heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and field capacity
for soil moisture are prescribed according to geographically varying values
derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil type distributions
(cf. <a href="#Patterson 1990">Patterson 1990</a>, and <a href="#Zobler 1986">Zobler
1986</a>).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Soil temperature is determined after <a href="#Warrilow et al. 1986">Warrilow
et al. (1986)</a> from the heat conduction in 5 layers (proceeding downward,
layer thicknesses are 0.065, 0.254, 0.913, 2.902, and 5.70 m), with net
surface heat fluxes as the upper boundary condition and zero heat flux
as the lower boundary condition at 10 m depth.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Snow pack temperature is also computed from the soil heat equation using
heat diffusivity/capacity for ice in regions of permanent continental ice,
and for bare soil where water-equivalent snow depth is &lt;0.025 m. For
snow of greater depth, the temperature of the middle of the snow pack is
solved from an auxiliary heat conduction equation (cf. <a href="#Bauer et al. 1985">Bauer
et al. 1985</a>). The temperature at the upper surface is determined by
extrapolation, but it is constrained not to exceed the snowmelt temperature
of 0 degrees C.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
There are separate prognostic moisture budgets for snow, vegetation canopy,
and soil reservoirs. Snow cover is augmented by snowfall and is depleted
by sublimation and melting. Snow melts (augmenting soil moisture) if the
temperatures of the snow pack and of the uppermost soil layer exceed 0
degrees C. The canopy intercepts precipitation and snow (proportional to
the vegetated fraction of a grid box), which is then subject to immediate
evaporation or melting.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>Soil moisture is represented as a single-layer "bucket" model
(cf. <a href="#Manabe 1969">Manabe 1969</a>), but with field capacity that
varies according to soil type (</font><a href="#Patterson 1990">Patterson
1990)</a>. <font size=+0>Direct evaporation of soil moisture from bare
soil and from the wet vegetation canopy, as well as evapotranspiration
via root uptake, are modeled. Surface runoff includes effects of subgrid-scale
variations of field capacity related to the orographic variance; in addition,
wherever the soil is frozen, moisture contributes to surface runoff instead
of soil moisture. Deep runoff due to drainage processes also occurs independently
of infiltration if the soil moisture is between 5 and 9 percent of field
capacity (slow drainage), or is larger than 90 percent of field capacity
(fast drainage). When the model atmosphere is coupled to a dynamical ocean,
this source of freshwater is discharged at coastal points by means of a
river transport model that uses local runoff as input. Cf. <a href="#D�menil and Todini 1992">D&uuml;menil
and Todini (1992)</a> and <a href="#Sausen et al. 1994">Sausen et al. (1994)</a>
for further details.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<br>
<a NAME="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The sea ice model, based on that of <a href="#Hibler 1979">Hibler (1979)</a>,
predicts ice thickness, concentration, and momentum, as well as the thickness
of an accumulating snow pack. Ice concentration and ice/snow thickness&nbsp;
are computed from their respective continuity equations.&nbsp; Further
parameterizations relate heat fluxes to changes in ice and snow thickness,
lead size, and salinity due to brine ejection. The conversion from snow
to ice also is parameterized.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The thermodynamic part of the ice model predicts the vertical temperature
profile, taking into account the heat capacity and conductivity of the
slab and the net surface heat flux.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
A viscous-plastic rheology is chosen to parameterize the stress tensor.
The governing equations are solved on an Arakawa B-grid with no-slip horizontal
boundary conditions. See <a href="#Oberhuber 1993a">Oberhuber (1993a)</a>
for further details.</li>
