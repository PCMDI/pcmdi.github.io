<h3><a name="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
This model was originally submitted to the CMIP1 intercomparison, but
was
subsequently withdrawn from active status at the request of the
modeling
group representatives.
<h3><a name="Spinup/Initialization"></a><font size="+1">Spinup/Initialization</font></h3>
The spinup/initialization procedure was as follows (cf. <a
 href="#Washington%20et%20al.%201994">Washington
et al. 1994</a> and <a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201996">Washington
and
Meehl 1996</a> for further details):
<ul>
  <li>The atmospheric model was initialized from the final
quasi-equilibrium
state of a run made when coupled to a 50-meter slab mixed-layer ocean
without
provision of horizontal heat transports (cf. <a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The ocean model was first run for 14 years with robust diagnostic
forcing
from the three-dimensional observed temperature and salinity fields
after <a href="#Levitus%201982">Levitus
(1982)</a>, along with "early winter" SSTs near Greenland specified to
produce a meridional overturning of about 20 sverdrup in the Atlantic
(cf. <a href="#Washington%20et%20al.%201994">Washington
et al. 1994</a>). The ocean model then was run for 100 more years with
specified surface forcings, but with subsurface forcings turned off. By
the end of this integration, the maximum drift in temperature was of
the
order of a few tenths of a degree near the thermocline.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The model atmosphere and ocean then were coupled an integrated
for 100
years without application of any flux corrections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Land surface temperature is determined from the balance of
surface
energy
fluxes by the diagnostic method of <a
 href="#Holloway%20and%20Manabe%201971">Holloway
and Manabe (1971)</a>. (That is, there is no heat diffusion/ storage
within
the soil.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Soil moisture is represented by the single-layer "bucket" model
of <a href="#Budyko%201956">Budyko
(1956)</a> and <a href="#Manabe%201969">Manabe (1969)</a>, with field
capacity
a uniform 0.15 m of water. Soil moisture is increased by both
precipitation
and snowmelt. It is decreased by surface evaporation, which is
determined
from the product of the evapotranspiration efficiency beta and the
potential
evaporation from a surface saturated at the local surface
temperature/pressure.
Over land, beta is given by the ratio of local soil moisture to the
field
capacity, with runoff occurring implicitly if this ratio exceeds unity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice thermodynamics follow <a href="#Semtner%201976">Semtner
(1976)</a>
with some modifications.&nbsp; The calculation of the ice/snow
thermodynamic
state variables is based on the diffusion of heat through the external
and internal boundaries of a three-layer system. If the ice thickness
is
greater than 0.5 m, two layers of ice are maintained; snow, if present,
constitutes s a third layer.&nbsp; When the ice thickness is between
0.25
m and 0.5 m, only a single layer is retained.&nbsp; If the ice
thickness
falls below 0.25m, the zero-layer model of <a href="#Semtner%201976">Semtner
(1976)</a> is employed. The entire net heat flux from the ocean is
applied
to the lateral ice growth/melt; thus, when computing the vertical
balance,
the heat flux at the bottom of the ice is set to zero.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;Snow accumulation on sea ice is computed from the
freshwater flux
(precipitation minus evaporation). Any snow melt is added to the
freshwater
flux into the ocean.&nbsp; Precipitation on sea ice at the freshwater
melting
point (0 deg C) is assumed to fall directly into the ocean.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A fraction (0.3, assuming cloudy conditions 75 percent of the
time) of
solar radiation is allowed to penetrate snow-free ice. The penetrating
radiation may be transmitted to the ocean or absorbed in the ice,
depending
on its thickness. The absorbed fraction contributes to the internal
melting
of ice in brine pockets following <a href="#Semtner%201976">Semtner
(1976)</a>
(i.e., the absorbed flux is stored in a heat reservoir without
affecting
the overall ice thickness). The ice albedo depends on snow cover/depth
and surface temperature.&nbsp; (The albedo computation assumes a mix of
snow-covered and snow-free ice and uses a proxy &#8216;snow fraction&#8217;.)&nbsp;
The albedos of ice and snow depend on spectral interval, and on whether
these surfaces are dry or melting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sea ice dynamics are based on the cavitating-fluid approximation
of <a href="#Flato%20and%20Hibler%201990">Flato
and Hibler (1990)</a>: ice has a finite resistance to compression, but
can diverge freely without resistance to shear stress.&nbsp; For
further
details, see <a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201996">Washington and
Meehl
(1996)</a>.</li>

The atmospheric component of the NCAR (Washington &amp; Meehl) coupled
model is a <i>modified </i>Community Climate Model Version Zero A
(CCM0A)
that is described by <a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and
Meehl (1993)</a>. Differences from the <i>standard </i>CCM0A model
(cf.
<a href="#Washington%201982">Washington
1982</a>, <a href="#Pitcher%20et%20al.%201983">Pitcher et al. 1983</a>,
<a href="#Ramanathan%20et%20al.%201983">Ramanathan
et al. 1983</a>, and <a href="#Malone%20et%20al.%201984">Malone et al.

) include the treatment of <a href="#Radiation">cloud-radiative
interactions</a>,
<a href="#Convection">convection</a>,
<a href="#Surface%20Characteristics">surface

<p>Standard CCM0A was a precursor of the NCAR CCM1 model (cf. <a
 href="#Williamson%20et%20al.%201987">Williamson
et al. 1987</a>, <a href="#Kiehl%20et%20al.%201987">Kiehl et al. 1987</a>).
Except
for its explicit inclusion of the <a href="#Trace%20Gases">radiative
effects
of greenhouse trace gases</a>, AMIP model <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya_ToC.html">SUNYA
CCM1-TG (R15 L12) 1990</a> is identical to the NCAR CCM1. The chief
differences
between this <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya_ToC.html">AMIP
model</a> and both the standard and modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) versions of CCM0A are summarized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <a name="Vertical Representation"></a><b>Vertical Representation</b>
  <p><b>I</b>n contrast to the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC10">AMIP
model</a>, the vertical finite-difference approximations in both the
standard
and modified (<a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington and
Meehl
1993</a>) CCM0A models are not energy-conserving.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <a name="Vertical Resolution"></a><b>Vertical Resolution</b>
  <p>There are 9 vertical levels in the standard and modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A models, rather than 12, as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC11">AMIP
model</a>. </p>
  <p><a name="Smoothing/Filling"></a><b>Smoothing/Filling</b> </p>
  <p>In contrast to the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC16">AMIP
model</a>, the filling of negative values of atmospheric humidity that
arise from truncation errors in the discretized moisture equation is
not
implemented in either the standard or the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A models. </p>
  <p><a name="Diffusion"></a><b>Diffusion</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In both the standard and modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A models, tropospheric horizontal diffusion is
represented in a second-order (del^2) form on sigma surfaces, rather
than
in fourth-order (del^4) on pressure surfaces, as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC20">AMIP
model</a>. Frictional heating present in the AMIP model also is not
included.</li>
    <li>Vertical diffusion in both the standard and the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A models is linear, and is applied only below
500
hPa, as opposed to the nonlinear diffusion that operates through the
entire
atmospheric column in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC20">AMIP
model</a>. Unlike the AMIP model also, the diffusion coefficient does
not
depend on local shear and stability.</li>
    <br>
&nbsp;
  </ul>
  <a name="Radiation"></a><b>Radiation</b>
  <ul>
    <li>The modified (<a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and
Meehl
1993</a>) CCM0A model follows the standard CCM0A radiation scheme after
      <a href="#Ramanathan%20et%20al.%201983">Ramanathan
et al. (1983),</a> except for the specification of cloud shortwave
albedo
and longwave emissivity. In the <a href="#Ramanathan%20et%20al.%201983">Ramanathan
et al. (1983)</a> scheme, cloud emissivity is universally a black-body
value of unity, while cloud albedo depends on solar zenith angle and
cloud
height: the albedo is 0.6 for low cloud, 0.3 for middle cloud, and 0.15
for high cloud. In the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A model, middle and high cloud longwave
emissivities
are set to 0.90 and 0.70 respectively. Middle and high cloud albedos
also
may increase above their nominal values (0.3 and 0.15, respectively),
provided
that there is both deep convection and SSTs that are in excess of 303
K;
for such conditions, the albedo of middle and high cloud may increase
linearly
up to 0.6 over an SST range of 303 to 308 K.</li>
    <br>
&nbsp;
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Cloud-radiative interactions in the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A model also differ from those of the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model</a>, where stratiform cloud emissivity is a function of
diagnostic
liquid water content and cloud albedo is a function of optical depth
and
solar zenith angle, but does not depend on convection or SSTs. Both the
standard and the modified (<a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A models also lack certain other radiative
refinements
of the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model</a> , such as improved formulations of shortwave absorption by
water
vapor and oxygen and longwave absorption by water vapor, carbon
dioxide,
and ozone (cf. <a href="#Kiehl%20et%20al.%201987">Kiehl et al. 1987</a>).</li>
    <br>
&nbsp;
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <a name="Trace Gases"></a>Both the standard and the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993</a>) CCM0A models do not include the radiative effects
of
trace greenhouse gases that are present in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC24">AMIP
model</a>.</li>
    <br>
&nbsp;
  </ul>
  <a name="Convection"></a><b>Convection</b>
  <p>In addition to the moist convective adjustment scheme of the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC25">AMIP
model</a> (present also in the standard CCM0A model), the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993)</a> CCM0A includes a parameterization of convective
mass
fluxes of heat and moisture, and a simple cloud model to determine the
depth of convection. Cf. <a href="#Albrecht%20et%20al.%201986">Albrecht
et al.
(1986)</a> and <a href="#Meehl%20and%20Albrecht%201988">Meehl and
Albrecht (1988</a>, <a href="#Meehl%20and%20Albrecht%201991">1991)</a>
for further details. </p>
  <p><a name="Cloud Formation"></a><b>Cloud Formation</b> </p>
  <p>In both the standard and the modified (<a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">Washington
and Meehl 1993)</a> CCM0A models, atmospheric moisture begins to
condense
into clouds at 80 percent relative humidity rather than at 100 percent,
as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC26">AMIP
model</a>. </p>
  <p><a name="Surface Characteristics"></a><b>Surface Characteristics</b>
  </p>
  <p>In contrast to the standard CCM0a model, the sea ice albedo in the
modified <a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">(Washington
and Meehl 1993)</a> CCM0A is a function of latitude and the snow albedo
is a function of solar zenith angle; however, these albedos do not
depend
on spectral interval or surface temperature, as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC33">AMIP
model</a>. </p>
  <p><a name="Surface Fluxes"></a><b>Surface Fluxes</b> </p>
  <p>The surface wind-stress formulation of the modified <a
 href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">(Washington
and Meehl 1993)</a> CCM0A model differs from that of the standard CCM0A
in the Western Pacific, so as to better reproduce the observations of
strong
vertical wind shear over this region. The surface drag coefficient in
both
the standard and modified <a href="#Washington%20and%20Meehl%201993">(Washington
and Meehl 1993)</a> CCM0A models is not stability-dependent, as in the <a
 href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/amip/home/Documentation/31sunya.html#RTFToC34">AMIP
model</a>. <br>
