<a NAME="Participation"></a>Participation</h3>
Model NRL1 is an entry in the CMIP1 intercomparison only.
<h3>
<a NAME="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The spinup/initialization procedure was as follows (cf. <a href="#Li and Hogan 1998">Li
and Hogan 1998</a> for further details):
<ul>
<li>
The atmospheric model was integrated for 5 years with prescribed seasonally
varying SSTs, and the last 3 years were averaged to obtain an estimate
of annual-mean surface conditions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The ocean model was integrated with these annual-mean forcings, while the
SSTs were relaxed toward their observed annual- mean values, until a quasi-equilibrium
state was achieved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Annual-mean flux corrections for heat and momentum (i.e., surface-wind
forcing) to be supplied to the ocean model in coupled mode then were computed
from the differences between the fields simulated by the atmospheric model
with prescribed SSTs and the observations (for surface winds, the COADS
data set--cf. <a href="#Sadler et al. 1987">Sadler et al. 1987</a>).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The atmosphere and ocean were coupled and integrated for 40 years with
application of these annual-mean flux corrections. Model data from the
last 36 years of this simulation were supplied for the CMIP I intercomparison.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Soil temperatures are computed from a surface energy balance that includes
snowmelt as well as relaxation (with 100-hour time constant) to <a href="#FNOC 1986">FNOC
(1986)</a> monthly climatological deep-ground temperatures. These deep
temperatures are derived from observed surface atmospheric temperatures
that are lagged by one month, with annual cycle reduced by 30 percent.
The heat capacity specified for soil is also a nonlinear function of the
ground wetness, and the thermal conductivity of snow-covered ground is
set to about twice that of bare ground.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Soil hydrology is determined from a modified bucket model. Continental
runoff, which occurs locally when the moisture capacity of the bucket is
exceeded, does not contribute to the freshwater flux into the ocean model.
Cf. <a href="#Hogan and Rosmond 1991">Hogan and Rosmond (1991)</a> for
further details.</li>
</ul>
