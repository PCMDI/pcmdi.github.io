<hr>This article reviews some problems associated with the use of coupled
atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs) in studies which attempt
to detect a greenhouse-gas-induced signal in observed climate records.
We show that model uncertainties affect both our predictions of how climate
might change in response to greenhouse-gas (GHG) changes, and our estimates
of the decadal- to century-time scale natural variability properties of
the climate system. Knowledge of the latter are essential in order to make
meaningful statements about when and even whether we could expect to detect
a greenhouse-gas signal.
<p>We show that GHG signal uncertainties are associated with errors in
simulating the current climate in uncoupled and coupled climate models,
the possible omission of relevant feedbacks, the non-uniqueness of the
signal (due to the twin problems of the model's internally-generated natural
variability and its sensitivity to initial conditions), uncertainties regarding
the future GHG forcing and atmospheric GHG concentrations, and the so-called
"cold start" error. Results from recent time-dependent greenhouse warming
experiments are used to illustrate some of these points. We then discuss
how energy-balance models, stochastically-forced ocean GCMs, and fully-coupled
atmosphere-ocean GCMs have been used to derive estimates of decadal- to
century-time scale natural variability, and consider some of the uncertainties
associated with these estimates.
<p>This review illustrates that it will be necessary to reduce both model
signal and model natural variability uncertainties in order to detect a
climate change signal and attribute this convincingly to change in carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases. <a href="pdf/rep10.pdf">(pdf file)</a>
