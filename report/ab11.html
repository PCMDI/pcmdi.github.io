<h1>Report 11:&nbsp; Preliminary Validation of the Low Frequency
Variability of Tropospheric Temperature and Circulation Simulated for the
AMIP by the ECMWF Model</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle, </b>James S.
<br>April 1993, 22 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>The ECMWF global model (cycle 36) is used to simulate the climate from
1979 to 1988. This integration is in support of the WGNE Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The model uses the observed monthly sea
surface temperature for the ten year period during the integration. Anomaly
correlation and RMS calculations are carried out between monthly mean observed
circulation (ECMWF analyses and MSU channel 2 temperatures) and the model
results, although the use of monthly mean data restricts the conclusions
to the low frequency variability. The variables and regions considered
are the 500 hPa geopotential and MSU temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere
(30N to 70N), the 200 hPa zonal wind and MSU temperataures for the equatorial
belt (15S to 15N), and the 1000 hPa zonal wind for the equatorial Pacific
(15N to 15S and 120E to 100W).
<p>The results show:(1) For the midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential there
is a signal in the model results for the ENSO events of 1982/83 and 1986/87;
(2) the model underestimates the midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential interannual
variability as measured by the RMS but overestimates the MSU temperature
variability in this region; (3) in general, outside of the ENSO periods,
there is little correlation between the model and observed data anomalies
of midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential; (4) in the tropics the variables evince
a stronger correlation with observations in the interannual variation;
(5) in the tropics the model underestimates the variability of the 200
hPa wind and MSU temperature; (6) the model, although non-interacting with
the ocean, produces a credible simulation of the low frequency variability
of the equatorial Pacific low level zonal wind. <a href="pdf/rep11.pdf">(pdf
