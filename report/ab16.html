<hr>Three-dimensional climate models generate a large volume of time history
data in the form of multidimensional arrays. Repeated postprocessing of
these data is required to produce the relevant statistics needed for comparison
with other model histories and observational data. Networks and desktop
graphics workstations have made it possible to use remote supercomputers
to perform climate simulations and postprocess their time history data,
and then subsequently use local workstations to analyze, compare, and view
the results. New software tools and methods are required to take advantage
of these technological advances.
<p>In climate research, it is common to extract two-dimensional, horizontal
grids from datasets for analysis and display. In addition, it has become
increasingly common to extract and visualize other two-dimensional cross-sections,
as well as three- and four-dimensional fields, from large datasets. The
ability to quickly animate images of such data is providing a new perspective
for understanding climate models.
<p>This document describes the Data Retrieval and Storage (DRS) software
library, Version 2.8, which defines a data format and access methods suitable
for the data generated and used in climate model research. It is oriented
toward use (1) with models generating very large datasets on supercomputers,
and (2) with graphics workstations used for analysis and display of smaller
subsets of data. This software is used extensively by the Program for Climate
Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) for the storage, postprocessing, analysis, and display
of atmospheric model and observational data, and is available to collaborators
in the climate modeling and diagnostic communities upon request.
