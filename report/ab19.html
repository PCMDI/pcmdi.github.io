<h1>Report 19:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global Ocean Circulation
and Equator-Pole Heat Transport as a Function of Ocean GCM Resolution</h1>
<ul><b>Covey, </b>Curt
<br>June 1994, 33 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>To determine whether resolution of smaller scales is necessary to simulate
large-scale ocean climate correctly, I examine results from a global ocean
GCM run with horizontal grid spacings. The horizontal grid spacings span
a range from coarse resolutions traditionally used in climate modeling
to nearly the highest resolution attained with today's computers. This
work represents an extension (to lower resolutions) of earlier studies
by Semtner and Chervin. The experiments include four cases employing 4°ƒ,
2°ƒ, 1°ƒ and 1/2ƒ° spacing in latitude and longitude, which
were run with minimal differences among them, i.e., in a controlled experiment.
Two additional cases?? 1/2°ƒ spacing with a more scale-selective sub-gridscale
mixing of heat and momentum, and approximate 1/4°ƒ spacing?are also
included. The 1/4ƒ° run resolves most of the observed mesoscale eddy
energy in the ocean.
<p>Several artificial constraints on the model tend to minimize differences
among the different resolution cases. Nevertheless, for quantities of interest
to global climate studies the simulations show significant changes as resolution
increases. These changes generally but not always bring the model into
better agreement with observations. Differences are typically more noticeable
when comparing the 4ƒ° and 2ƒ° runs than when comparing the 2°ƒ
and 1°ƒ runs or the 1°ƒ and 1/2ƒ° runs. A reasonable conclusion
to draw for current studies with coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs is that
the ocean grid spacing could be set to about 1°ƒ to accrue the benefits
of enhanced resolution without paying an excessively steep price in computer-time
cost.
</p><p>The model's poleward heat transport at 1/2°ƒ grid spacing peaks
at about 1 x 10^15 W in the Northern Hemisphere and 0.5 x 10^15 W in the
Southern Hemisphere. These values are significantly below observations,
a problem typical of ocean GCMs even when they are less constrained than
in the present study (e.g., when they are coupled to an interactive atmosphere).
This problem is alleviated somewhat in the 1/4° run. In this case,
however, the eddies resolved by the model generally act to counter rather
than to reinforce the heat transport of the mean flow. Improved heat transport
may result less from enhanced resolution than from other changes made in
this version of the model, such as more accurate wind forcing. <a href="pdf/rep19.pdf">(pdf
