<h1>Report 20:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Northern Wintertime
Divergence Extrema at 200 hPa and Surface Cyclones as Simulated in the
AMIP Integration of the ECMWF General Circulation Model</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle,</b> James S.
<br>November 1994, 31 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>Divergence and convergence centers at 200 hPa and mean sea-level pressure
(MSLP) cyclones were located every 6 hr for a 10-yr general circulation
model (GCM) simulation with the ECMWF (Cycle 36) for the boreal winters
from 1980 to 1988. The simulation used the observed monthly mean sea surface
temperature (SST) for the decade. Analysis of the frequency, location,
and strength of these centers and cyclones gives insight into the dynamical
response of the model to the varying SST.
<p>The results indicate that (1) the model produces reasonable climatologies
of upper-level divergence and MSLP cyclones; (2) the model distribution
of anomalies of divergence and convergence centers and MSLP cyclones is
consistent with observations for the 1982-83 and 1986-87 El Ni&ntilde;o
events; (3) the tropical Indian Ocean is the region of greatest divergence
activity and interannual variability in the model; (4) the variability
of the divergence centers is greater than that of the convergence centers;
(5) strong divergence centers occur chiefly over the ocean in the midlatitudes
but are more land-based in the tropics, except in the Indian Ocean; and
(6) locations of divergence and convergence centers can be a useful tool
for the intercomparison of global atmospheric simulations. <a href="pdf/rep20.pdf">(pdf
