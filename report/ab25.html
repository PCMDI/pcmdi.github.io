<h1>Report 25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimates of Zonally Averaged
Tropical Diabatic Heating in AMIP GCM Simulations</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle, </b>James S.
<br>August 1995, 35 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>The vertical distribution of zonally and seasonally averaged diabatic
heating is estimated for 29 GCM AMIP decadal simulations using the thermodynamic
equation. Since only the zonally averaged, monthly means were available,
the transient and stationary wave components are not included in this budget.
The exclusion of these terms limits the useful analysis to the Tropics.
The vertically averaged values from the budget computation are compared
to the vertically averaged diabatic heating computed directly from the
sensible heat and radiative fluxes, and precipitation. The comparison is
quite favorable in the Tropics, with the effects of the neglected heat
fluxes becoming apparent at about 30 degrees poleward from the Equator.
The computations are carried out for the solstitial seasons.
<p>Based on the median heating distribution of the 29 models we find the
following:&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The model consensus of near equatorial heating
is greater in magnitude and lower (~500 mb) than that computed from the
ECMWF analysis by Hoskins et al. (1989). (2) The subtropical cooling tends
to be greater in magnitude and highter than the Hoskins et al. computation,
although this will be affected by the terms neglected in the budget computation.
Consideration of the individual model fields show that (3) there is a large
variation in the magnitude and distribution of the tropical diabatic heating
amongst the models. The magnitudes in the northern summer vary by more
than a factor of two. (4) the amount of seasonal asymmetry about the equator
varies widely among the models. For some models the heating maximum remains
on the northern side of the equator for both seasons. (5) It is evident
that the interactions among the many parameterizations and model formulations
obscure any systematic signature of a particular penetrative convective
scheme. Finally, given the differences in the heating distributions among
the models for this zonally-averaged, seasonally-averaged ten-year data
set, it is clear that there is not yet a consensus on the proper parameterization
suite to simulate this essential field. <a href="pdf/rep25.pdf">(pdf file)</a>
