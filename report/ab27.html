<hr>Recent studies have shown that patterns of near-surface temperature
change due to combined forcing by carbon dioxide and anthropogenic sulphate
aerosols are easier to identify in the observations than signals due to
changes in carbon dioxide alone (Santer et al., 1995; Mitchell et al.,
1995a). Here we extend this work to the vertical structure of atmospheric
temperature changes, and additionally consider the possible effects of
stratospheric ozone reduction.
<p>We compare modeled and observed patterns over the lower troposphere
to the lower stratosphere (850 to 50 hPa) and over the low- to mid-troposphere
(850 to 500 hPa). In both regions there are strong similarities between
observed changes and model-predicted signals. Over 850 to 50 hPa similarities
are evident both in carbon dioxide-only signals and in signals that incorporate
the added effects of sulfate aerosols and stratospheric ozone reduction.
These similarities are due largely to a common pattern of stratospheric
cooling and tropospheric warming in the observations and model experiments.
<p>Including the effects of stratospheric ozone reduction results in a
more realistic height for the transition between stratospheric cooling
and tropospheric warming. In the low- to mid-troposphere the observations
are in better agreement with the temperature-change patterns due to combined
forcing than with the carbon dioxide-only pattern. This is the result of
hemispheric-scale temperature-change contrasts that are common to the observations
and the combined forcing signal but absent in the carbon dioxide-only case.
The levels of model-versus-observed pattern similarity in both atmospheric
regions increase over the period 1963 to 1987. If model estimates of natural
internal variability are realistic, it is likely that these trends in pattern
similarity are partially due to human activities. <a href="pdf/27.pdf">(pdf
