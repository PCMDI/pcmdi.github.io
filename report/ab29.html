<h1>Report 29: Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis of Climate Data
</h1>
<ul><b>Sengupta, </b>Sailes K. and James S. Boyle
<br>December 1995, 21 pp.&nbsp;
<hr><font size=-1>In traditional principal component analysis (PCA) a few
significant linear combinations of the original variables are extracted
to arrive at a parsimonious description of a complex data set obtained
from climate observations, analysis or from GCM ouputs.These are uncorrelated
variables which are used in practice to understand the principal modes
of variation in the climatological process under study. If we drop the
requirement of linearity and uncorrelatedness, a greater data reduction
is possible allowing us to deal with fewer modes of variation. These nonlinear
functions can in fact be obtained by using a series of auto-associative
feed-forward neural networks in which the residuals from the previous network
are fed as the contents of the input output pair for the next. It can be
shown that in special cases such networks provide ordinary principal components.</font>
<p><font size=-1>We have explored this methodology to gain a better understanding
of the precipitation data over the US observed over land and bordering
oceans for the 1979 to 1988 decade. A careful comparison with the linear
counterpart has been made. The improvement in the data reduction is noticeable
but not overwhelming. Certain details in the modes of variation are more
pronounced in the nonlinear representation. The leading nonlinear mode
captures the seasonal cycles more clearly than the leading linear mode.
In the latter, the seasonal cycle is shared by subsequent modes of the
PCA. The principal linear and nonlinear modes of the observational data
has been intercompared with the corresponding modes of the data obtained
from a GCM simulation.</font>
<p><font size=-1>We conclude by observing that nonlinear principal component
analysis (NLPCA) based on auto-associative neural networks is potentially
a more effective data reduction tool than conventional PCA. Also the principal
modes of variation of the precipitation data of the continental US are
better differentiated by a NLPCA than by ordinary PCA. It should be tried
as an alternative method especially when linear PCA fails to show meaningful
patterns in climatological data analysis.</font><i><a href="pdf/29.pdf">(pdf
