<h1>Report 30: Correlation Between Outgoing Longwave Radiation and Surface
Temperature in the Tropical Pacific: A Model Intercomparison
</h1>
<ul><b>Covey, </b>Curt
<br>January 1996, 14 pp.&nbsp;
<hr><font size=-1>Results from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
show that general circulation models tend to underestimate the emission
of anomalous heat to space during the 1987 El Ni&ntilde;o episode in the
tropical Pacific. This bias suggests that the models may underestimate
negative feedbacks on climate involving longwave radiation in the tropical
atmosphere. Such a possibility is consistent with analyses of paleo-data
that suggest climate models generally overestimate climate sensitivity
in the tropics. <a href="pdf/30.pdf">(pdf
