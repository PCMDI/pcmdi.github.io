<h1>Report 38:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Climatology of East Asian
Winter Monsoon and Cold Surges: Results from the 1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis</h1>

<br>October 1996, 29 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>This paper presents the climatology of the East Asian winter monsoon
and cold surges based on the 1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. In addition
to documenting the frequency, intensity, and preferred propagation tracks
of cold surges and the evolution patterns of associated fields, the temporal
distribution of the Siberian high and cold surges is discussed. Further,
this study examines the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and
cold surges and its relationship with ENSO.
<p>There are on average thirteen cold surges in each winter season (October
to April), of which two are strong cases. The averaged intensity of cold
surges, measured by maximum surface pressure, is 1053 hPa. The cold surges
originate from two primary source regions: 1) northwest of Lake Baikal,
and 2) north of Lake Balkhash. The typical evolution of a cold surge occurs
over the period of 5-14 days. Trajectory and correlation analyses indicate
that, during this time high pressure centers propagate southeastward around
the edge of the Tibetan Plateau from the mentioned source regions. Some
of these high pressure centers then move eastward and diminish over the
ocean, while others proceed southward. The signature of the associated
temperature, wind, and pressure fields propagate farther southward and
eastward. The affected area encompasses the bulk of the maritime continent.
Although the intensity of the Siberian high is found to peak during December
and January, the frequency of cold surges has a maximum in November and
in March. This result suggests that November through March should be considered
as the East Asian winter monsoon season.
<p>Two stratifications of cold surges are used to examine the relationship
between ENSO and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon. The first
one, described as the conventional cold surges, indicates that the cold
surge frequency reaches a minimum a year after El Nino events. The second
one, defined as the maximum wind events near the South China Sea, shares
the same source regions as the first. This stratification of surges is
found to be in good agreement with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).
Low SOI (high SOI) events coincide with high (low) frequencies of cold
surges.
<p>The interannual variation of averaged meridional wind near the South
China Sea and the maritime continent is dominated by the South China Sea
cold surges, and is also well correlated (R=0.82) with the SOI. Strong
wind seasons are associated with La Nina and high SOI events; likewise,
weak wind years are linked with El Nino and low SOI cases. This pattern
is restricted north of the equator within the region of (0&deg;N-20&deg;N,
110&deg;E-130&deg;E), and is confined to the near surface layer. The surface
Siberian high, 500 hPa trough and 200 hPa jetstream, all representing the
large-scale monsoon flow, are found to be weaker than normal during El
Nino years. In particular, the interannual variation of the Siberian high
is in general agreement with the SOI.(<i><a href="pdf/38.pdf">pdf</a></i>)
