<hr>This paper evaluates simulations of the East Asian winter monsoon in
eight GCMs that participated in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(AMIP). In addition to validating the mean state of the winter monsoon,
the cold surge and its transient properties, which includes the frequency,
intensity, preferred propagation tracks, and the evolution patterns of
the surges, are examined. GCM simulated temporal distribution of the Siberian
high and cold surges is also discussed. Finally, the forcing of the cold
surges on the tropical surface wind and convection, along with their interannual
variation is analyzed.
<p>The mean state of the winter monsoon is generally portrayed well in
the models considered. These include the climatological position of the
Siberian high, the 200 hPa divergent center, and the large-scale wind patterns
at the surface and 200 hPa. Models display a wide range of skill in simulating
the cold surge and its transient properties. In some of the models, the
simulated cold surge trajectory, intensity, frequency, propagation patterns
and source regions are in general agreement with those from the observed.
While in others, the models cannot adequately capture these observed characteristics.
The temporal distribution of the Siberian high and cold surges are realistically
reproduced in most GCMs. Most models were able to simulate the effect of
the cold surges on the tropical surface wind, although a few models unrealistically
generated subtropical southerly wind in the mid-winter.
<p>The common discrepancies in the winter monsoon simulation can be attributed
to many factors. In some models, the inadequate resolution and the improper
locations of the tropical convection are the most notable reasons. The
satisfactory simulations of the monsoon circulation and the cold surges
are partly due to the topographical characteristics of the East Asian continent,
i.e., the Tibetan Plateau to the west and the oceans to the east. The correct
simulation of the interannual variation of the surface wind near the South
China Sea (SCS) and the maritime continent is a demanding task for most
of the models. This will require adequate simulations of many aspects,
including tropical convection, the Siberian cold dome, the extratropical-tropical
linkage, and the air-sea interaction.
<p>The discrepancies noted here furnish a guide for the continuing improvement
of the winter monsoon simulations. Improved simulations will lead to an
adequate delineation of the surface wind and convection near the maritime
continent, which is essential for portraying the winter monsoon forcing
in a coupled model. <a href="pdf/39.pdf">(pdf
