<h1>Report 40:&nbsp; Comparing GCM Simulations, Ensembles
and Model Revisions Using Common Principal Components</h1>
<ul><b>Sengupta,</b> Sailes and James S. Boyle
<br>May 1997, 38 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>The technique of common principal components (Flury, 1988) is applied
to compare the results of a number of GCM simulations. The data used are
from 30 AMIP simulations and an ensemble of five AMIP integrations from
a single GCM. As suggested by the name, the common principal components
analysis of these data identifies the common elements of the integrations.
The components are determined in the spatial domain. The results are for
the seasonal cycle of precipitation over the US and for the seasonal and
interannual variations of global 200 hPa divergence.
<p>The precipitation analysis shows that the models share only the broadest
aspects of the seasonal cycle in precipitation and the common vector loadings
vary substantially between the models. The analysis of the ensemble integrations
for the same variable indicates that the model variations are generally
quite a bit larger than the variations amongst the members of the ensemble.
The ensemble results give some confidence that the differences among the
models are robust and that they would not change greatly for other realizations
of the model integrations. In itself, the ensemble analysis displays the
usefulness of the CPC technique in succinctly combining the output of any
number of realizations from a given model. Their common character is a
robust signal and is the answer often sought from ensemble experiments.
<p>The CPC analysis of the five ensemble simulations shows that the interannual
variations in the divergence are dominated by the ENSO events for the AMIP
decade, 1979-1988 The analysis indicates that the ENSO global signal is
robust across all the simulations such that one simulation is all that
is necessary to characterize the global response. The intrinsic variability
of the model begins to dominate the components higher than the first.
<p>The difference between the 200 hPa divergence of four closely related
AMIP models and the NCEP /NCAR reanalysis was analyzed using the CPC technique.
The models all share the ECMWF dynamical core. When compared to the analogous
analysis of the ensembles, it is seen that the models form two distinct
pairs although some distinctive characteristics are retained. The CPC is
shown to have value in documenting the impact of modifying parameterizations
on the simulations.
<p>The CPC analyses tend to support the observation that the models often
have more in common with each other than with the observations. The CPC
approach has utility in answering many useful questions posed in the arena
of model comparison when used in conjunction with other techniques. <a href="pdf/40.pdf">(pdf
