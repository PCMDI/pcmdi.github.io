<p><h1>Report 41:&nbsp; Comparison of CCM3 Simulations Using
Two Climatological Ozone Data Sets</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle,</b>&nbsp; James S.
<br>May 1997, 27 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>A comparison of two six-year simulations with the NCAR CCM3 using different
monthly mean, zonally symmetric ozone climatologies is presented.&nbsp;
Each run was identical except for the ozone specification. The climatological
SSTs supplied with CCM3 were cycled for the extent of the simulation. The
ozone data sets used were the data distributed with the CCM3 code and that
compiled at SUNY Albany. The SUNYA data set reflects contemporary ozone
measurements, extensively using remote sensed data. The CCM3 data were
produced from measurements prior to 1974. A brief comparison of the two
ozone climatologies is presented.
<p>The monthly mean difference fields were computed for the six years of
the simulations. A t-test was applied to the monthly mean difference to
judge if the changes between the integrations were significant. The significant
changes in temperature were for the most part confined to the levels above
200 hPa. In the zonal mean the patterns of differences were largely consistent
with regions of the ozone variations. Deeper tropospheric penetration of
temperature differences occurred in October near the South Pole in the
region of the "ozone hole". The significant temperature changes at the
lowest model level ( ~992 hPa) were confined to very small areas.
<p>The 200 hPa zonal wind differences demonstrated that the stationary
wave structure was evidently altered by the ozone differences. Although
the ozone specifications were zonally symmetric, the zonal wind differences
were zonally asymmetric at 200 hPa.
<p>The differences in the two simulations were generally small below 100
hPa. However, the differences are not negligible and it would be make model
intercomparison problematic if all the participants in AMIP do not use
the same ozone data. This problem is most serious for models using the
older, pre-ozone hole data sets. <i><a href="pdf/41.pdf">(pdf file)</a></i>
