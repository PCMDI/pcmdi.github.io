<p><h1>Report 42:&nbsp; Preliminary Comparison of Climatological
Ozone Data Sets</h1>
<ul><b>Boyle,</b>&nbsp; James S.
<br>August 1997, 20 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>This report provides a brief overview of some recently compiled ozone
climatologies. The purpose of the comparision is to aid in deciding what
ozone data should be recommended for the AMIP II integrations.
<p>The data sets examined are products from efforts at the State University
of New York ant Albany ( SUNYA), U. K. Universities Global Atmospheric
Modelling Programme (UGAMP) and Free University Berlin / Royal Netherlands
Meteorolgical Institute (FUB/KNMI). All these data set are generated from
ozonesondes and satellite retrievals from a number of platforms. Each group
employed different techniques for merging the data from the disparate sources.
The base data are also from different time periods. The tropospheric estimates
represent the greatest observational uncertainty.
<p>Compared to an older data set, all the new compilations show the presence
of ozone depletion in the austral spring near the South Pole. <i><a href="pdf/42.pdf">(pdf
