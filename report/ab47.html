<p><h1>Report 47:&nbsp; Determination of the Sampling Size of
AGCM Ensemble Simulationstions</h1>

<hr>
<br>Historically, the high computational expense of performing lengthy
climate simulations has limited the number of realizations in ensemble
calculations. In this paper, we exploit the computational advantage of
a recently developed parallel atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM)
to determine the number of realizations required to calculate the model's
statistics to a specified degree of certainty. Using standard statistical
analysis techniques, this minimum ensemble size is found to be highly dependent
on which output field is under examination. A strong dependence on location,
season and averaging is also revealed. <i><a href="pdf/47.pdf">(pdf file)</a></i>
