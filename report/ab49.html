<h1>Report 49:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparison of the 200 hPa
circulation in CSM and CCM3 simulations and NCEP and ERA reanalysis:&nbsp;
Principal and Common Principal Components</h1>

<br>In this paper the interannual variation of monthly mean vorticity and
diver-gence at 200 hPa are compared from four data sources: The NCEP/NCAR
reanalyses 1958 through 1994, the ECMWF (ERA) reanalyses, 1979 through
1994, a NCAR CCM3 integration using prescribed SSTs from 1979 through 1993,
and the NCAR CSM 300 year integration. Four twenty year periods were taken
from the 300 year simulation for analysis. The NCEP, ERA and CCM3 all provide
data for the period 1979 through 1993. The techniques used are principal
and common principal component analyses on the fields transformed to spherical
harmonics. The seasonal cycle is removed.
<p>For the common time period, 1979 through 1993, the ERA, NCEP and CCM3
display a close correspondence in their the leading PCs of the 200 hPa
vorticity. This mode is closely related to the ENSO variations of the period
but the agreement extends to the extratropics. All four CSM periods have
leading modes similar to each other which are dominated by a PNA type pattern
and lack any Equatorial Pacific ENSO signature.
<p>The agreement between the leading PCs for the ERA, NCEP and CCM3 for
the 200 hPa divergence was somewhat less than that of the vorticity. The
CCM3 and ERA indicate a somewhat larger magnitude center in the Equatorial
Pacific about the dateline than NCEP. The CSM has an intense center a farther
east at 150E. There are indications in the vorticity and divergence fields
that this center is at the source for waves propagating to the mid latitudes
yielding the PNA structures.
<p>Two twenty year periods of the 1958 to 1996 NCEP reanalyses show a distinct
difference between the two periods. The variations are comparable in magnitude
if not nature to the variations seen amongst the 20 year time sections
of the CSM run examined.
<p>A CPC analysis of the NCEP, ERA and CCM3 show a common ENSO type response
as the leading common component. The CCM3 model departs from the reanalyses
for the second component. Combining the CCM3, CSM, NCEP and ERA shows that
the CSM does share a common component ENSO related feature. Both the CSM,
and CCM3 depart in the same manner with regard to the second common component
which has a PNA like nature.&nbsp; <i><a href="pdf/49.pdf">(pdf
