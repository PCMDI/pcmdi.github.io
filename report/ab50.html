<h1>Report 50:&nbsp; Comparison of the 200 hPa circulation
in CSM and CCM3 simulations and NCEP and ERA reanalysis:&nbsp; Seasonal
cycle and interannual variation</h1>
<ul>
<ul>James S. Boyle
<br>December 1998, 38 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>
<br>In this paper the monthly mean vorticity and divergence at 200 hPa
are compared from four data sources: The NCEP/NCAR reanalyses 1958 through
1994, the ECMWF (ERA) reanalyses, 1979 through 1994, a NCAR CCM3 integration
using prescribed SSTs from 1979 through 1993, and the NCAR CSM 300 year
integration. The NCEP, ERA and CCM3 all provide monthly mean data for the
period 1979 through 1993. The time scales examined are the annual cycle
and interannual variations.
<p>The annual mean vorticity of the ERA and NCEP match very closely. The
annual cycle is likewise in good agreement except in the eastern equatorial
Pacific and Indian Ocean. Compared to the reanalyses, the models have adequate
annual means but suffer in the depiction of the annual cycle in the regions
of the jet maxima and in some regions of the Tropics. The CSM appears to
inherit errors from the CCM3.
<p>The annual mean divergence evinces a much larger difference between
the reanalyses.&nbsp; This is most pronounced in the Tropics, especially
over the African and South American land masses. The model simulations
also show large differences, with the CSM being an outlier in the tropical
Pacific. For many tropical and extratropical locations the annual cycle
is not well defined between the NCEP and ERA reanalysis.
<p>The NCEP, ERA, CCM3 and CSM agree with respect to the variance of the
monthly mean vorticity. The variance for low pass filtered data is too
large in the ENSO regions for the CCM3, but too small for the CSM. Both
models tend to underestimate the low frequency variance in mid latitudes.
<p>The ERA has substantially more monthly variance in the divergence than
the NCEP data, especially over the tropical South America and Africa and
the Dateline.&nbsp; Both models have variance more in line with that of
the ERA, and have an anomalous maximum in the eastern Indian Ocean, the
CSM much more so. The CSM shifts the maxima in the equatorial Pacific from
Dateline seen in the reanalyses to 150E.
<p>The CCM3 appears to be too sensitive to the Equatorial SST anomalies,
which may contribute to or exacerbate the poor ocean simulation in the
tropical Pacific by the CSM. There are errors in the CCM3 integration which
foreshadow, deficiencies in the CSM integration, so the ocean is not solely
at fault.
<p>The amount of disagreement between the ERA and NCEP divergence fields
on the time scales of the annual cycle and low frequency variations indicates
that this field is poorly defined, and in some regions unknown except for
sign.&nbsp; <i><a href="pdf/50.pdf">(pdf file)</a></i></ul>
