<br><b>Abstract</b>
<p>We examine the seasonal cycle of near-surface air temperature simulated
by 17 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models participating
in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).&nbsp; Nine of the
models use ad hoc "flux adjustment" at the ocean surface to bring model
simulations close to observations of the present-day climate.&nbsp; We
group flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted models separately and examine
the behavior of each class.&nbsp; When averaged over all of the flux-adjusted
model simulations, near-surface air temperature falls within 2 degrees
K of observed values over the oceans.&nbsp; The corresponding average over
non-flux-adjusted models shows errors up to ~6 K in extensive ocean areas.&nbsp;
Flux adjustments are not directly applied over land, and near-surface land
temperature errors are substantial in the average over flux-adjusted models,
which systematically underestimates (by ~5 K) temperature in areas of elevated
terrain.&nbsp; The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models
forms a similar error pattern (with somewhat increased amplitude) over
land.
<p>We use the temperature difference between July and January as a measure
of seasonal cycle amplitude.&nbsp; Zonal means of this quantity from the
individual flux-adjusted models form a fairly tight cluster (all within
~30% of the mean) centered on the observed values.&nbsp; The non-flux-adjusted
models perform nearly as well at most latitudes.&nbsp; In Southern Ocean
mid-latitudes, however, the non-flux-adjusted models overestimate the magnitude
of January-minus-July temperature differences by ~5 K due to an overestimate
of summer (January) near-surface temperature.&nbsp; This error is common
to five of the eight non-flux-adjusted models.&nbsp; Also, over Northern
Hemisphere mid-latitude land areas, zonal mean differences between July
and January temperatures simulated by the non-flux-adjusted models show
a greater spread (positive and negative) about observed values than results
from the flux-adjusted models.&nbsp; Elsewhere, differences between the
two classes of models are less obvious.&nbsp; At no latitude is the zonal
mean difference between averages over the two classes of models greater
than the standard deviation over models.
<p>&nbsp;The ability of coupled GCMs to simulate a reasonable seasonal
cycle is a necessary condition for confidence in their prediction of long-term
climatic changes (such as global warming), but it is not a sufficient condition
unless the seasonal cycle and long-term changes involve similar climatic
processes.&nbsp; To test this possible connection, we compare seasonal
cycle amplitude with equilibrium warming under doubled atmospheric carbon
dioxide for the models in our data base.&nbsp; A small but positive correlation
exists between these two quantities.&nbsp; This result is predicted by
a simple conceptual model of the climate system, and it is consistent with
other modeling experience, which indicates that the seasonal cycle depends
only weakly on climate sensitivity. (<i><a href="pdf/51.pdf">pdf</a></i>)</ul>
