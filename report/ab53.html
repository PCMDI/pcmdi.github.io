<h1>Report 53:&nbsp; Predictability and the Relationship
Between Subseasonal and Interannual Variability During the Asian Summer
Monsoon</h1>
<br>&nbsp;

<p>July 1999, 53 pp.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>The relationship between subseasonal and interannual variability of
the Asian Summer Monsoon has been investigated through analysis of the
dominant modes of variability in the 40-year NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, with
complementary satellite and surface based precipitation data. The hypothesis
that the characteristics of monsoon subseasonal variability (i.e. weather
regimes) are modulated on interannual times-cales in a systematic and therefore
predictable manner has been tested. The null hypothesis is that predictability
of the seasonal mean monsoon behaviour requires only that the effects of
the slowly varying components of the climate system be correctly simulated.
<p>An interannual mode of monsoon variability has been identified which
is closely related to the observed seasonal mean all-India Rainfall (AIR).
A counterpart of this mode has also been identified at subseasonal timescales
which projects strongly on to the daily AIR, confirming that a common mode
of monsoon variability exists on seasonal and subseasonal timescales.
<p>It has been shown that the temporal behaviour of this subseasonal mode,
as de-scribed by the probability distribution function (PDF) of the principal
component timeseries, does not show any evidence of bimodality, the shape
of the PDF being Gaussian. Further, it has been shown that the mean of
the PDF is systematically and significantly perturbed towards negative
(positive) values in weak (strong) monsoon years as categorized in terms
of the seasonal mean AIR. This translation in the mean of the PDF, rather
than a change in shape of the PDF suggests that anomalous monsoons are
not associated with changes in weather regimes. Further analysis has con-firmed
that low frequency modulation of the basic state is primarily responsible
for these shifts in the subseasonal PDFs, supporting the null hypothesis
that predictability of the seasonal mean monsoon requires only that the
effects of the slowly varying components of the climate system be correctly
simulated. Thus model improvements to reduce systematic errors in the mean
simulation and the response to low frequency boundary forcing may improve
the prospects for dynamical seasonal prediction.
<p>However, the results have also shown that only a subset of the subseasonal
modes are systematically perturbed either by ENSO or in weak vs. strong
monsoon years, suggesting that predictability is likely to be limited by
the chaotic, internal variability of the monsoon system.<i><a href="pdf/53.pdf">(pdf
