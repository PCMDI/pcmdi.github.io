<br>Abstract
<p>The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulations of 17 global coupled
ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (CGCMs) from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are analyzed. Monthly mean values of surface
air temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation for 80 years are
analyzed from control runs. Nearly half of the models studied do not employ
any form of flux correction, although flux-corrected CGCMs were better
at simulating the base state of the temperature field in the equatorial
Pacific but not necessarily better at simulating ENSO variability. While
a subset of the models produce realistic amplitudes of NINO3 and the Southern
Oscillation Index (SOI), ENSO often tends to occur at a higher than observed
frequency. A few models also capture the teleconnection between NINO3 temperature
anomalies, SOI, and the global surface air temperature, sea level pressure
and precipitation. Composities of ENSO warm and cold events demonstrate
that only a few models simulate phase locking of ENSO with the seasonal
cycle. Most models have problems in simulating the ENSO related sea level
pressure variations over the eastern Pacific, and this is associated with
errors in the precipitation response. [<i><a href="pdf/61.pdf">pdf file
