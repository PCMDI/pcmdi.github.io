<br>Abstract
<p>The<i> </i>Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), an initiative
of the World Climate Research Programme since 1990, is a standard experimental
protocol for testing the performance of global atmospheric models. One
of the many studies facilitated by the AMIP is the evaluation of model
simulation of processes at the land surface, a key locus of human interaction
with the climate system. In particular, the relationship between different
continental climate simulations and the properties of the respective coupled
land-surface schemes (LSSs) may be investigated. Studies of this type have
been coordinated by the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterization
Schemes (PILPS), organized as AMIP Diagnostic Subproject 12.
<p>After recounting the history of the AMIP/PILPS collaboration to date,
we describe a method for concisely displaying the spatio-temporal variability
of a land-surface simulation relative to that of validation reference data.
We apply this method to the continental simulation of 30 model entries
in the first phase of the AMIP intercomparison.
<p>We find that the overall agreement of simulated continental climate
variability with that of selected reanalysis reference data is a function
of the land-surface process considered. Of the monthly mean land-surface
variables available from these AMIP simulations, the spatio-temporal variability
of continental evaporation shows the greatest sensitivity to the LSS representation
of hydrology. Moreover, in twin AMIP simulations where this representation
is changed from a simple "bucket" scheme to&nbsp; a biophysically based
formulation (while retaining the same atmospheric model and land-surface
characteristics), there is a general reduction in the RMS errors of the
continental climate simulation relative to the reference data. However,
these LSS-related improvements are due almost exclusively to changes in
the amplitude of the continental climate variability, suggesting that it
is the atmospheric forcings and/or the land-surface characteristics that
largely control the pattern of this variability. We plan to investigate
such issues more fully in the second phase of the AMIP. <i><a href="pdf/rpt63.pdf">(pdf
