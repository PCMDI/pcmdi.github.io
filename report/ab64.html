<br>Abstract
<p>Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) channel 2 temperatures are computed for
three sets of model experiments and their interannual variation is compared
to that of the observed.&nbsp; The models used are: (1) an ensemble of
ten integrations of the NCAR CCM3 using prescribed SSTs for 1979 to 1995,
(2) a 300 year integration of the NCAR/DOE Parallel Climate Model (which
has the CCM3 as the atmospheric model) and (3) a 300 year integration of
the ECHAM4/OPYC coupled model at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.&nbsp;
In addition, Nino34 and AO indices were computed from SST and MSLP of each
data set.&nbsp; The observed data spanned the period of 1979 to 1998.&nbsp;
The CCM3 integrations used the observed SSTs from 1979 to 1995.&nbsp; The
300 year coupled runs were divided into non-overlapping 20 year segments,
and each segment was processed independently.
<p>The EOFs of the zonally averaged, monthly mean MSU-2 anomalies were
computed.&nbsp; An SVD analysis of the covariance of the tropical (30S-30N)
precipitation and MSU-2 was carried out.
<p>The first and second modes of the observations are related to the ENSO
variations and the Arctic Oscillation, respectively.&nbsp; The Nino34 index
leads the ENSO mode by 5 months in the observations.&nbsp; For the nine
realizations of the CCM3, all have the ENSO as the leading mode, but one
does not have the AO as the second.&nbsp; The lag between the Nino34 and
leading EOF decreases to about 3 months.&nbsp; The fourteen PCM 20 year
segments show a similar variation to the CCM3, but the lag is decreased
to 2 months.&nbsp; All fourteen of the ECHAM segments have the ENSO and
AO as the leading and second modes.&nbsp; The fourteen ECHAM data sets
evince smaller variations between segments than the PCM and even the CCM3
realizations.&nbsp; The lag between the ECHAM Nino34 and the leading EOF
is about 3 months.&nbsp; Thus, both coupled models have a substantially
faster response to variations in tropical SSTs.&nbsp; This can affect the
way that these models simulate the relation between the seasonal cycle
and ENSO.</ul>
