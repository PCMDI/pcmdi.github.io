<br>Abstract
<p>The low frequency variation in the three dimensional air temperature
fields of two reanalyses and two model simulations are described.&nbsp;
The data sets used are the monthly mean temperature fields for the NCAR
Climate Simulation Model (CSM, Boville and Gent, 1998) 300 year run, an
NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3, Kiehl et al., 1998) AMIP
type simulation, and the NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF (ERA) reanalysis data sets.&nbsp;
The variances and correlations are computed for the anomalies from the
annual cycle for each data set.
<p>In general, the reanalyses and models agree fairly well on the structure
of the temperature variance.&nbsp; The models tend to have too much variance
at the surface compared to the reanlyses.&nbsp; The CSM's poor simulation
of the SST in the eastern Pacific leads to a much reduced variance in the
Nino3 region.&nbsp; The enhanced variability over land appears to affect
the midlatitude simulation of the CSM, in that the higher surface variability
extends off the east coast of continents.&nbsp; This is not evident in
CCM3 and reanalyses where the SSTs are prescribed.
<p>At 200 hPa the CCM3 and reanalyses all evince the dumbbell pattern straddling
the Equator in the eastern Pacific, attributed by Yulaeva and Wallace (1994)
to ENSO variations.&nbsp; The CSM shows no such pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
CCM3 integration using climatological SSTs displays more variance than
the CSM in this region.&nbsp; Apparently the coupling to an ocean in the
CSM suppresses the atmospheric model's variability in this locale.
<p>The correlations of the temperature fields with the surface air temperature
show that the regions of subtropical subsidence are virtually uncorrelated
to the surface at the 700 hPa level.&nbsp; The regions of the cold water
off the west coast of continents evince decoupling with the surface at
850 hPa.&nbsp; In the region from 30S to 30N the zonal mean correlation
falls to about 0.7 below 800 hPa, with this value extending up to about
600 hPa in mid and upper latitudes.&nbsp; These characteristics are consistent
across all the data sets.&nbsp; Thus, the variations of vertically integrated
measures such as MSU temperatures need not agree with observations of surface
air temperatures at the time scales examined here.
