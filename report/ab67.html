<br>Abstract
<p>Several previous studies have attempted to remove the effects of explosive
volcanic eruptions and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability
from time series of globally-averaged surface and tropospheric temperatures.&nbsp;
Such work has largely ignored the non-zero correlation between volcanic
signals and ENSO.&nbsp; Here we account for this collinearity using an
iterative procedure.&nbsp; We remove estimated volcano and ENSO signals
from the observed global mean temperature data, and then calculate trends
over 1979-1999 in the residuals.
<p>Residual trends are sensitive to the choice of index used for removing
ENSO effects and to uncertainties in key volcanic parameters.&nbsp; Despite
these sensitivities, residual surface and lower tropospheric (2LT) trends
are almost always larger than trends in the raw observational data.&nbsp;
After removal of volcano and ENSO effects, the differential warming between
the surface and lower troposphere is generally reduced.&nbsp; These results
suggest that the net effect of volcanoes and ENSO over 1979-1999 was to
reduce globally-averaged surface and tropospheric temperatures and cool
the troposphere by more than the surface.
<p>ENSO and incomplete volcanic forcing effects can hamper reliable assessment
of the true correspondence between modeled and observed trends.&nbsp; In
the second part of our study, we remove these effects from model data and
compare simulated and observed residual trends.&nbsp; Residual temperature
trends are not significantly different at the surface.&nbsp; In the lower
troposphere, the statistical significance of trend differences depends
on on the experiment considered, the choice of ENSO index, and the volcanic
signal decay time.&nbsp; The simulated difference between surface and tropospheric
warming rates is significantly smaller than observed in 51 out of 54 cases
considered.
<p>We also examine multiple realizations of model experiments with relatively
complete estimates of natural and anthropogenic forcing.&nbsp; ENSO and
volcanic effects are not removed from these integrations.&nbsp; As in the
case of residual trends, model and observed raw trends are in good agreement
at the surface but differ significantly in terms of the trend differential
between the surface and lower troposphere.&nbsp; Observed and simulated
lower tropospheric trends are not significantly different in 17 out of
24 cases.
<p>Our study highllights the large uncertainties inherent in removing volcano
and ENSO effects from atmospheric temperature data.&nbsp; It shows that
statistical removal of these effects improves the correspondence between
modeled and observed temperature trends over the satellite era.&nbsp; Accounting
for volcanoes and ENSO cannot fully explain the observed warming of the
surface relative to the lower troposphere, or why this differential warming
is not reproduced in the model simulations considered here.</ul>
