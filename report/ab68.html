<br>Abstract
<p>The chaotic behavior of the continental climate of an atmospheric general
circulation model is investigated from an ensemble of decadal simulations
with common specifations of radiative forcings and monthly ocean boundary
conditions, but different initial states of atmosphere and land. The variability
structures of key model land-surface processes appear to agree sufficiently
with observational estimates to warrant detailed examination of their predictability
on seasonal time scales. This predictability is inferred from several novel
measures of spatio-temporal reproducibility applied to eleven model variables.
The reproducibility statistics are computed for variables in which the
seasonal cycle is included or excluded, the former case being most pertinent
to climate model simulations, and the latter to predictions of the seasonal
anomalies. Because the reproducibility metrics in the latter case are determined
in the context of a "perfectly" known ocean state, they are properly viewed
as estimates of the potential predictability of seasonal climate. Inferences
based on these reproducibility metrics are shown to be in general agreement
with those derived from more conventional measures of potential predictability.
<p>It is found that the land-surface variables which include the seasonal
cycle are impacted only marginally by changes in initial conditions; moreover,
their seasonal climatologies exhibit high spatial reproducibility. In contrast,
the reproducibility of a seasonal land-surface anomaly is generally low,
although it is considerably higher in the Tropics; its spatial reproducibility
also fluctuates in tandem with warm and cold phases of the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern
Oscillation phenomenon. However, the detailed sensitivities to initial
conditions depend somewhat on the land-surface process: pressure and temperature
anomalies exhibit the highest temporal reproducibilities, while hydrological
and turbulent flux anomalies show the highest spatial reproducibilities.
Implications of these results for model intercomparisons and seasonal forecasts
are elaborated.
