<p>ABSTRACT
<br>Uncertainties in climate observations are revealed when alternate observationally
based data sets are compared. General circulation model-based "reanalyses"
of meteorological observations will yield different results from different
models, even if identical sets of raw unanalyzed data form their starting
points. We have examined 25 longitude-latitude fields (including selected
levels for three-dimensional quantities) encompassing atmospheric climate
variables for which the PCMDI observational data base contains two or more
high-quality sources. For the most part we compare ECMWF with NCEP reanalysis.
In some cases, we compare in situ and / or satellite-derived data with
reanalysis.
<p>To obtain an overview of the differences for all 25 fields, we use a
graphical technique developed for climate model diagnosis: a "portrait
diagram" displaying root-mean-square differences between the alternate
data sources. With a few exceptions (arising from the requirement that
RMS differences be normalized to accommodate different units of variables)
the portrait diagrams indicate areas of agreement and disagreement that
can be confirmed by examining traditional graphics such as zonal mean plots.
In accord with conventional wisdom, the greatest agreement between alternate
data sets - hence the smallest implied observational uncertainty - occurs
for upper tropospheric zonal wind. We also find fairly good agreement between
reanalysis and more direct measures of precipitation, suggesting that modern
observational systems are resolving some long-standing problems with its
measurement.<p>To view the full report please go to&nbsp; <a href="pdf/rpt69.pdf">Report
