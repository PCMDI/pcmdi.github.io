<p><font size="+1">ABSTRACT</font><font size="+1"></font>
</p><p><font size="+1">To significantly improve the simulation of climate by
general circulation models (GCMs), systematic errors in representations
of relevant processes must first be identified, and then reduced.&nbsp;
This effort demands that the GCM parameterizations of unresolved processes,
in particular, should be tested over a wide range of frequencies, not just
at climate scales.&nbsp; A methodology for developing parameterizations
in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models therefore may be applicable,
provided this approach is appropriately adapted for climate GCMs.&nbsp;
Such an NWP-inspired methodology entails the generation of short-range
weather forecasts by a realistically initialized climate model, and the
use of high-frequency NWP analyses and observations of parameterized variables
to evaluate these forecasts.&nbsp; The efficacy of modified GCM parameterizations
also can be tested in such a weather-forecasting framework.</font><font size="+1"></font>
</p><p><font size="+1">In order to further this approach for improvement of parameterizations
in climate GCMs, the U.S. Department of Energy is funding a joint venture
of its Climate Change Prediction Program (CCPP) and Atmospheric Radiation
Measurement (ARM) Program:&nbsp; the CCPP-ARM Parameterization Testbed
(CAPT).&nbsp; In this article, we elaborate the scientific rationale for
CAPT, discuss technical aspects of its implementation in a representative
climate GCM, and present results that illustrate the CAPT methodology.</font>
