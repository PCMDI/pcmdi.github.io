<p>PCMDI is pleased to announce the publication of its first comprehensive appraisal of
coupled climate models. The appraisal is based on an extensive analysis of the models used
in the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project's (CMIP)
"2+" experiment of control and idealized climate change experiments. A PDF version of the
report can be downloaded <a href="pdf/rpt71.pdf">here.</a> The file is formatted for easy
printing on standard 8.5 by 11 inch paper, but much of the detail in some of the smaller
figures is best viewed on a computer screen.</p>
