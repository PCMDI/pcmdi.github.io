    <p><em>(LLNL-MI-409571)</em></p>

</center>

<p>The datasets are described in the document "<a href="MSU_doc.pdf">Information Regarding Synthetic Microwave Sounding
    Unit (MSU) Temperatures Calculated from CMIP-3 Archive</a>". Potential users should download and read this document
    before downloading the datasets. No additional documentation nor additional support for these data can be provided.
</p>

<p>Publications using any or all of the synthetic MSU T<sub>2</sub> temperatures and/or the synthetic T<sub>2LT</sub>
    temperatures should reference these datasets as follows:</p>

<p>"Synthetic MSU temperatures from 49 simulations of 20<sup>th</sup> century climate change were calculated as
    described in Santer, B.D., et al., 2008: Consistency of modeled and observed temperature trends in the tropical
    troposphere. <i>International Journal of Climatology</i>, <b>28</b>, 1703-1722, doi:10.1002/joc.1756."</p>

<p>The datasets are available as two GZIP archives of 49 ASCII files each. Open source utilities to extract the files
    from the archive on computers running the Windows and UNIX operating systems are available at <a
            href="http://www.gzip.org">http://www.gzip.org</a>. File extraction was tested using the commercial software
    package WinZip (<a href="http://www.winzip.com">http://www.winzip.com</a>) on a Windows XP computer system.</p>

<p><span class="style1">Data withdrawn:</span> Please note that for the CNRM model, the air temperature data ("ta") were
    reported to PCMDI on only 12 layers for the period 1860-1899, but on all 17 standard pressure levels for the
    subsequent years of the historical run (1900-2000). When the CNRM ta data first arrived at PCMDI, they were
    processed incorrectly for the period before 1960. The data were assumed to be similar to those of all other models
    we had processed, and to exist on the same number of levels throughout the simulation. Subsequently, the processing
    of ta data was corrected, with results correctly stored on 12 levels before 1900 and 17 levels thereafter. The
    synthetic MSU temperatures were computed before the error in the CNRM ta data was noticed. For this reason, <strong>as
        of April 2010, the incorrect CNRM synthetic MSU temperatures from 1860-1959 have been removed from the PCMDI
        website. </strong>The CNRM synthetic MSU temperature data from 1960 to 2000 are correct and remain available. It
    should be noted that PCMDI scientists have not published any articles that use CNRM synthetic MSU temperature data
    for the period prior to 1960. Thus, there is no need to revise any published results.</p>
