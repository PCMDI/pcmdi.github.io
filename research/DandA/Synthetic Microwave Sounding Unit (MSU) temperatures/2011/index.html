    <p><h1>New Synthetic Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) Datasets 2011, <br/>
        Developed using Method by C. Mears, 2011</h1></p>

    <p><em>(LLNL-IM-499392)</em></p>

<p>The details of the datasets are described in the '<a href="JGR_Santer_etal_Supporting_Material_16aug11.pdf">Supporting
    Material</a>'.Potential users should download and read this document before downloading the datasets. No additional
    documentation nor additional support for these data can be provided.</p>
<p>The data was developed using a new method by Carl Mears at Remote Sensing Systems in Santa Rosa, California, and is
    documented in a scientific paper currently under review at the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</p>
<p>Mears, C.A., B.D. Santer, C.S. Doutriaux, and F.J. Wentz,<strong> 2011</strong>: Calculating synthetic microwave
    sounder brightness temperatures from discrete-level data. <em>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</em> (in
    review).</p>

    temperatures should reference these datasets as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="TLT_picntrl.tar">TLT_picntrl.tar</a>&quot; contains time series of monthly-mean lower
    tropospheric temperature anomalies from the 29 CMIP-3 pre-industrial
    control runs described in Table S3 of the document appended to this
    email [this document is the online &quot;<a href="JGR_Santer_etal_Supporting_Material_16aug11.pdf">Supporting
        Material</a>&quot; for Santer et
    al (2011)].</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="TLT_ex20c3m.tar">TLT_ex20c3m.tar</a>&quot; contains time series of monthly-mean lower
    tropospheric temperature anomalies from the 51 CMIP-3 simulations of
    historical climate change (the spliced 20CEN/SRES A1B simulations).
    These runs are described in Table S2 of the appended document.</p>
<p>All synthetic MSU temperature data in &quot;<a href="TLT_picntrl.tar">TLT_picntrl.tar</a>&quot; and
    &quot;<a href="TLT_ex20c3m.tar">TLT_ex20c3m.tar</a>&quot; were spatially-averaged over 82.5 degrees N to 70
    degrees S.</p>
<p>The third tar file &quot;<a href="SST_ex20c3m.tar">SST_ex20c3m.tar</a>&quot; contains the CMIP-3 sea-surface
    temperature (SST)
    data used for producing Figure 10 in Santer et al. (2011). </p>
<p>&quot;<a href="TLT_ex20c3m.tar">SST_ex20c3m.tar</a>&quot; consists of time series of monthly-mean SST anomalies
    from 50 CMIP-3 simulations of historical climate change (the 51 spliced
    20CEN/SRES A1B simulations in Table S2, minus the ncar_pcm_run2, which
    begins in 1961, and does not cover the full 1947-2010 period used for
    analyzing SST data). All SST data in &quot;SST_ex20c3m.tar&quot; were
    spatially-averaged over 50 degrees N to 50 degrees S.</p>
