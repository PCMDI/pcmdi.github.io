# Earth System Model (ESM) Evaluation

#### [Diagnosis of Earth System Model Performance][Metrics]
PCMDIâ€™s mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and evaluation of Earth System Models (ESMs). The PCMDI metrics package is used to objectively compare results from ESMs with observations using well-established statistical tests. Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP6 and earlier CMIP phases.

# Cloud Feedbacks

#### [Cloud Feedbacks and Earth System Sensitivity Research][CloudFeedbacks]
PCMDI conducts extensive research to try and reduce uncertainty in climate sensitivity, with a focus on its primary driver, cloud feedback. This includes developing advanced diagnostics for evaluating cloud feedbacks, using cloud controlling factors to observationally constrain feedbacks, and discovering emergent constraints.
