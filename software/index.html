<h1> Software </h1><br>

<h2><a href="http://cfconventions.org" target="_blank">CF Conventions</a></h2>
	<h4>The conventions for CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf" target="_blank">NetCDF API</a>. The CF conventions are increasingly gaining acceptance and have been adopted by a number of projects and groups as a primary standard</h4><br><br>


<h2><a href="http://cmor.llnl.gov/" target="_blank">CMOR</a></h2>
	<h4>The "Climate Model Output Rewriter" (CMOR, pronounced "Seymour") comprises a set of C-based functions, with bindings to both Python and FORTRAN 90, that can be used to produce CF-compliant netCDF files that fulfill the requirements of many of the climate community's standard model experiments</h4>

<h2><a href="http://esgf.llnl.gov/" target="_blank">ESGF</a></h2>
	<h4>The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) enterprise system is a collaboration that develops, deploys and maintains software infrastructure for the management, dissemination, and analysis of model output and observational data</h4><br><br>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/PCMDI/pcmdi_metrics" target="_blank">PCMDI Metrics Package</a></h2>
	<h4>The PCMDI metrics package is used to objectively compare results from climate models with observations using well-established statistical tests. Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP5 and earlier CMIP phases</h4><br><br> 

<h2><a href="http://uvcdat.llnl.gov" target="_blank">UV-CDAT</a></h2>
	<h4>UV-CDAT is a powerful and complete front-end to a rich set of visual-data exploration and analysis capabilities well suited for climate-data analysis problems</h4><br><br>
