<h2><a href="http://pcmdi.github.io/cmor-site/"> CMOR </a></h2>
	<h4> The "Climate Model Output Rewriter" (CMOR, pronounced "Seymour") comprises a set of C-based functions, with bindings to both Python and FORTRAN 90, that can be used to produce CF-compliant netCDF files that fulfill the requirements of many of the climate community's standard model experiments</h4><br><br> 

<h2><a href="http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/index.html"> UV-CDAT </a></h2>
	<h4>UV-CDAT is a powerful and complete front-end to a rich set of visual-data exploration and analysis capabilities well suited for climate-data analysis problems.</h4><br><br>

<h2><a href="http://esgf.llnl.gov/"> ESGF </a></h2>
	<h4> The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) enterprise system is a collaboration that develops, deploys and maintains software infrastructure for the management, dissemination, and analysis of model output and observational data.</h4><br><br>
<h2><a href="http://cfconventions.org/">CF-Conventions</a></h2>
	<h4>he conventions for CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF API. The CF conventions are increasingly gaining acceptance and have been adopted by a number of projects and groups as a primary standard. </h4>
