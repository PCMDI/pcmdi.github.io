# Software

### [Climate Model Output Rewriter (CMOR)][CMOR]
The "Climate Model Output Rewriter" (CMOR, pronounced "Seymour") comprises a set of C-based functions, with bindings to both Python and FORTRAN 90, that can be used to produce CF-compliant netCDF files that fulfill the requirements of many of the climate community's standard model intercomparison project (MIP) experiments.


### [PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP)][PMP]
The PCMDI metrics package (PMP) is used to objectively compare results from climate models with observations using well-established statistical tests. Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP6, CMIP5 and earlier CMIP and AMIP phases.


### [Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions][CF]
The CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/" target="_blank">NetCDF API</a>. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.


### [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)][ESGF]
The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) federated data system is a collaboration that develops, deploys and maintains software infrastructure for the management, dissemination, and analysis of model output, forcing and observational data.

To access the ESGF websites, see the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (US, California) node [here][LLNL] or the Oakridge National Laboratory (US, Tennessee) node [here][ORNL]. Numerous additionally international sites are also available, in Germany ([DKRZ][DKRZ]), France ([IPSL][IPSL]) plus numerous others.


### [xarray Climate Data Analysis Tools (xCDAT)][xCDAT]
The xarray Climate Data Analysis Tools package (xCDAT) is an xarray extension for climate data analysis on structured grids. It serves as a modern successor to the Community Data Analysis Tools (CDAT) library.


### [Community Data Analysis Tools (CDAT; deprecated)][CDAT]
The Community Data Analysis Tools (CDAT) was a powerful and complete front-end to a rich set of visual-data exploration and analysis capabilities well suited for climate-data analysis problems. This software is now formally deprecated and no longer supported.
