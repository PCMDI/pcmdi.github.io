## Education

Ph.D., 1998, State University of New York at Stony Brook. New York, USA.

M.S., 1988, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences. Beijing, China.

B.S., 1985, Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, Nanjing, China.

## Research Interest

My research interests include climate model development and validation, cloud and convection parameterization developments, and objective data analysis. I work with the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and the NSF/DOE Community Atmospheric Model (CAM). I use a hierarchy process modeling approach, including single-column model (SCM), cloud-resolving model (CRM), and the Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed (CAPT), to test existing and new parameterizations with both field data and satellite observations.

As a co-Chair for the E3SM Atmospheric Group, I co-led the development of the first generation of E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAMv1). I am currently leading the development of atmospheric physics for the next generation of E3SM, which includes 8-10 subprojects and involves 30 scientists across 3 DOE labs and 5 universities/research centers. Specific emphasis is to integrate and assess various improvements in aerosol, clouds, and convection in E3SM at various model resolutions and develop efficient tools and strategies for high- resolution climate model tuning.

My research associated with CAPT, which utilizes the short-range weather forecast technique in diagnosing climate model errors, is to systematically explore the correspondence between short- and long-timescale systematic errors in current climate models and clarify over what timescales model systematic errors develop. The goal is to provide essential clue to the origins of these errors. The issues of particular interest include tropical precipitation errors, such as the unrealistic double ITCZ pattern in the simulated precipitation, and diurnal cycle of precipitation over both tropical and mid-latitude lands.

My research on parameterization developments is mainly focused on convective trigger/closure as well as relaxation timescale for deep convection. Specifically, I would like to understand what physical processes and large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic control of cumulus convection and how these processes can be appropriately parameterized in climate models. Currently I emphasize on improving the diurnal cycle of model precipitation, particularly the elevated nocturnal precipitation over lands, through improving convective triggering mechanisms. I am leading a Global Atmospheric System Studies (GASS) project on modeling diurnal and semi-diurnal cycle of precipitation in different climate regimes.

For the field data analysis, the goal is to develop necessary data products with advanced data analysis methods and quantify their uncertainty in support of cloud modeling study and climate model development. I have been heavily involved in the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program since 1998. One of my responsibilities is to transform the detailed ARM observations into a form that can be easily used by the climate modeling community. Some widely used data products from my ARM science infrastructure group include the ARM best estimate dataset (ARMBE), the large-scale forcing data for SCM/CRM studies, and the ARM ensemble cloud retrieval dataset (ACRED). We conduct relevant research to scientifically promote ARM data particularly to the climate modeling community, which includes the ongoing effort to develop an ARM radar simulator and an ARM-oriented process diagnostics package for GCMs to facilitate use of ARM data in climate model evaluations. We also explore the machine learning approach to help identify data quality issues with ARM observations.

Before I came to the United States, I had worked for 5 years at the National Meteorological Center of China. My research was in the development of numerical weather forecast model for medium-range weather forecasts, which included the development of numerical methods for calculating large-scale advection terms and testing various parameterizations of cumulus convection.
