<h3><a href="webres_14jan19.pdf">Dr. Santer's Curriculum Vitae</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben Santer is an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). His
        research focuses on such topics as climate model evaluation, the use of statistical methods in climate science,
        and identification of natural and anthropogenic “fingerprints” in observed climate records. Santer’s early
        research on the climatic effects of combined changes in greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols contributed to the
        historic “discernible human influence” conclusion of the 1995 Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
        Change (IPCC). His recent work has attempted to identify anthropogenic fingerprints in a number of different
        climate variables, such as tropopause height, atmospheric water vapor, the temperature of the stratosphere and
        troposphere, ocean heat content, and ocean surface temperatures in hurricane formation regions.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santer holds a Ph.D. in Climatology from the University of East Anglia, England. After
        completion of his Ph.D. in 1987, he spent five years at the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany,
        where he worked on the development and application of climate fingerprinting methods. In 1992, Santer joined
        LLNL’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison.

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santer served as convening lead author of the climate-change detection and attribution chapter
        of the 1995 IPCC report. His awards include the Norbert Gerbier–MUMM International Award (1998), a MacArthur
        Fellowship (1998), the U.S. Department of Energy’s E.O. Lawrence Award (2002), a Distinguished Scientist
        Fellowship from the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (2005), a Fellowship
        of the American Geophysical Union (2011), and membership in the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2011). He
        recently visited the Juneau Icefield in Alaska, and enjoys rock-climbing, mountaineering, and exploring the
        beautiful state of California with his wife Kris.
